96,"More than two million American men are currently living with prostate cancer, yet the national conversation about the disease consistently falls short. My colleague Dana Jennings, a writer and editor for The Times, was diagnosed with prostate cancer seven months ago. He has generously offered to share some of his experiences with the disease as a regular contributor to the Well blog.  By Dana Jennings  There is no such thing as a ""good cancer."" When my prostate cancer was diagnosed last April, I can't tell you how many well-meaning friends and acquaintances said: ""At least you have a good cancer."" What they were trying to say is that prostate cancer is often very treatable when detected in its early stages. Even so, nearly 30,000 American men died last year of ""the good cancer.""  (Photo: Dana Jennings. (Lonnie Schlein/The New York Times))   My cancer did appear to fall within the range of the ordinary. Treatment is still treatment, though, and a prostatectomy, no matter the method, is major surgery, with the twin shadows of impotence and incontinence always present.  But after my radical open prostatectomy on July 7, the pathology report revealed that my cancer wasn't so ordinary, after all, and showed what one doctor called a ""somewhat extraordinary scenario."" My apparently run-of-the-mill prostate cancer was actually an aggressive star among such cancers.  Rather than being a typically slow and pokey prostate cancer, mine had marched beyond the prostate and invaded a seminal vesicle and other tissue. It was a pure and aggressive prostate cancer. I soared from pre-surgery Gleason scores of 6 or 7 (two different hospitals, two different scores) to a Gleason of 9 — the higher the number on this scale of 10 the worse the news — and from having a probable Stage 1 cancer to a Stage 3: Stage T3B to be exact.  Some men with Gleason 9's do well, my doctors say, others don't. And even if I go into remission after my current treatment of hormonal therapy coupled with radiation, there's still a 50 percent chance that the cancer will return.  I'm 51 and married, have two sons (19 and 22), and I'm on the young side to have prostate cancer. If my cancer had been ""ordinary,"" if the prostate had been simply snipped out with only the usual complications (which are significant), I might not have felt compelled to write about it.   But I've been living with my cancer for more than seven months now, and have taken to regularly writing down my experiences and feelings about the disease in a journal to help me cope with — and try to understand — the very personal challenges it presents. Despite the prevalence of prostate cancer (nearly 200,000 new cases are diagnosed each year), I have found my diagnosis to be surprisingly isolating, partly because, in my view, the national conversation about prostate cancer is lacking. It dwells on statistics and treatment, and ignores deeper issues.  Doctors tend to default to mere competent professionalism, forgetting to talk directly to the scared flesh-and-blood man bearing the disease. Friends shift uncomfortably, turn squeamish, when the conversation turns to the most personal aspects of treatment, like sex, impotence and incontinence. And even men who have prostate cancer themselves, taking their cues from their doctors, I suspect, find it difficult to talk about. Instead, they sound as if they're spokesmen for their cancer, not men stricken with a serious disease.  In these posts I hope to provide an antidote to the averted eyes and the retreat into medical jargon that sometimes characterize talk about prostate cancer. Prostate cancer isn't just about surgery, treatment and survival — it's also about relationships, sex, self-esteem, embarrassment, hope and fear. By writing about my own experiences, I hope I can start a personal, honest and down-to-earth conversation about the disease — in all its bewildering sadness and, yes, in all its strange humor — with fellow prostate cancer patients, their caregivers and anyone else who is interested.   And I'll say this one more time: There is no such thing as a ""good cancer.""  Please join the discussion by posting your comment below. ",cancer,The Good Cancer?,96.0,96.0,96.0,96.0

110,"Last week, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) released its latest report on the state of the world's species. It makes for gloomy reading. Although there have been a few triumphs — species increasing their numbers thanks to conservation efforts — the general picture is one of decline. A quarter of all mammal species are now endangered, mostly because their habitat is disappearing. But of all the mammals now on the endangered list, from the fishing cat to the Caspian seal, the most startling is the Tasmanian devil.   (Photo: Tasmanian Devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) (Ian Waldie/Getty Images)) Tasmanian devils live on the island of (surprise!) Tasmania, off the south coast of Australia. They are marsupials: their young are born tiny (about a third of a gram — that's a hundredth of an ounce), then fed on milk and carried in a pouch. As adults, devils are thick-set, thuggish-looking animals, with massive teeth that they use to chomp up carcasses, bones and all. Although they are far from enormous — the biggest males weigh in at around 14 kilograms (30 pounds), about the size of a French bulldog — Tasmanian devils are the largest carnivorous marsupials to have, so far, escaped extinction.   But over the last 12 years, the population has crashed — in some areas, population numbers have fallen by 90 percent. The dramatic decline has led the IUCN to move the species from ""least concern"" a decade ago to ""endangered"" now. Some think it could be extinct within 25 years. The reason? An infectious cancer.  Some human cancers are infectious in the sense that they are caused by infectious viruses. Cervical cancer, for instance, is caused by human papilloma virus, which spreads from one person to another during sex.   But the cancer that's killing the Tasmanian devils is different. The cancer cells themselves are infectious.   Here's what happens. The cancer causes a tumor on the animal's face. If an infected animal bites another — which happens often, as devils are aggressive creatures, especially during the mating season — some of the tumor cells get transferred. These then start growing on the other animal. It's as though you kissed someone with throat cancer, and got their cancer yourself.  Which is pretty weird. Cancers are usually part of you, a group of your own cells that begin to grow out of control. Foreign cells — such as the ones that cause the devils' cancer — are normally rejected by the immune system. That's why organ transplants are difficult: the immune system immediately recognizes that the transplanted organ is not part of you, and begins attacking it. This happens unless there's a close match between the donor and the recipient at a set of genes known as the major histocompatibility locus, or MHC. If there is a match, you may be similar enough, genetically speaking, that the immune system doesn't notice the difference between the foreign organ and you. But unless you're having a transplant from a close relation, the odds of this are low. Human MHC genes are extremely variable. Most people who get organ transplants thus have to take drugs that suppress their immune system. Otherwise, the foreign organ gets attacked and destroyed.  So it's not surprising that most of the devil-style infectious cancers known in humans have happened when someone's immune system hasn't been working. Recipients of transplanted organs occasionally receive cancer cells as well; the drugs that prevent the immune system from destroying the organ also prevent it from destroying the foreign tumor. Because a baby's immune system doesn't get going until after it's born, a pregnant woman with cancer can infect her fetus. Likewise, if a mother is carrying several fetuses and one of them has a cancer, it can infect the others. But all these events are rare.  Even rarer are cases of direct transmission to someone whose immune system is robust. One example: a healthy surgeon injured his hand while operating on a cancer patient and contracted the patient's cancer. For reasons unknown, his immune system failed to respond. The resulting tumor was cut out, and the surgeon survived.  Tasmanian devils are not so lucky. Devil facial tumor disease, as it is known, kills within months. The tumor makes it hard for the animals to feed, so they starve.  The cancer has had a dramatic impact on their way of life. In the past, a female Tasmanian devil could expect to live to four or five. She'd start breeding at two, and have a litter every year. But in places where devil facial tumor disease has struck, life expectancy is short. Hardly any animals live beyond age three, and most females have only one chance to breed.   Interestingly, many females are now starting to breed in their first year. Although, before the disease, a few first-year females would manage to breed, most wouldn't. This has changed. In some populations, more than 80 percent of females are breeding in their first year. But in the absence of animals able to resist the disease, whether this will be enough to save the species from annihilation remains to be seen.  Why don't the devils reject the alien cells? There are two possibilities. The first is that the tumor somehow interferes with the immune response. (Many traditional tumors can do this.) The second is that the immune system fails to recognize the tumor as alien.   In the case of the devils, it seems to be the second. The animals don't have much genetic diversity at the MHC. So the immune system doesn't seem to be able to detect the invading cells because they're not different enough from the animal's own body. (Other animals with low MHC diversity, such as pocket gophers, can sometimes accept organ transplants from an unrelated member of their species.)   Tasmanian devils aren't the only animals to have a transmissible cancer. Dogs have one too. Theirs is transmitted during sex. Canine transmissible venereal tumor has been around for at least 200 years, and probably much longer. (The devils' disease, in contrast, was first spotted in 1996.) For dogs, the disease is rarely fatal. Instead, the tumor goes through an initial period of rapid growth, during which it manages to stop the dog's immune system from attacking it. But then, the immune system gets going, and kills the tumor. Having once been infected, a dog is resistant to the disease.   These cancers raise a number of questions. In particular: why aren't more cancers transmissible? After all, there are many, many types of cancer in many different species, but only two are known to spread from one animal to another. This suggests it isn't simply a matter of MHC diversity. After all, animals such as beavers and cheetahs have low diversity but no cancer; and the MHC situation of Tasmanian devils didn't suddenly change in the 1990s. Instead, it suggests that the cancer cells have to evolve in ways that makes them more likely to be transmissible. What those ways are, however, is a total mystery.  But if transmissible cancers have evolved twice, the odds are they can evolve again. The prospect is unnerving. (Even more unnerving is the idea that such cancers could be transmitted by mosquitoes, as was mooted for an infectious cancer said to be circulating among a species of hamster in the 1960s. Reports of this cancer are, however, absent from the recent scientific literature, and their significance is unclear.) Beavers and cheetahs, and other animals with low diversity at the MHC, could obviously be at risk of going the way of the devil, should a transmissible cancer evolve in these species.   What about us? Humans have lots of MHC diversity. But we have another risk factor. Owing to the failure to treat H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, in many parts of the world, large numbers of people have compromised immune systems. This is the sort of environment that could, perhaps, allow a transmissible cancer to evolve. Initially, it would circulate only among those who are immunocompromised. But, over time, it might evolve to infect healthy people too. It's an alarming thought — though happily, a thought is all it is. For now.  **********  NOTES:  For the state of mammals in this year's IUCN redlist, see here, and related links.   For general biology of Tasmanian devils, see pages 64-65 of Nowak, R. M. 1999.

As recently as two weeks ago, my libido hadn't yet checked out. But since then, hormone injections — like the oncologist's elves — have kept doing their job, which is to suppress testosterone. No testosterone, no sex drive, and, my doctors and I hope, eventually no prostate cancer.   But even with the promise of being cured, the physical changes in my sex life and, more shockingly, my recent loss of interest in sex, are among the most difficult aspects of having prostate cancer — not just for me, but for my wife, too.

191,"New York Times editor Dana Jennings writes each week about coping with an aggressive form of prostate cancer.  By Dana Jennings  (Photo: Dana Jennings. (Lonnie Schlein/The New York Times)) We are about to enter a holy few days for Jews and Christians. Passover starts at sundown tomorrow, and Easter is Sunday. But then again, when you're a cancer patient, each day is a holy day - no matter what your beliefs.   I converted to Judaism five years ago, after decades spent stumbling toward God. That faith has helped sustain me this past year, from the diagnosis of my prostate cancer, through surgery, and through radiation and hormone treatment when it was learned that I had an aggressive cancer.   I am not a fool. I am a patient with Stage T3B cancer and a Gleason score of 9. I need the skills and the insights of the nurses and doctors who care for me. But they don't treat the whole man. Medicine cares about physical outcomes, not the soul. I also need - even crave - the spiritual antibodies of prayer, song and sacred study.  And it's a powerful thing to know that others are praying for your return to health. My faith reminds me that I am not alone, that I am part of a larger whole, part of an ancient tradition and a timeless narrative. Disease often makes us feel cut off from community, even from ourselves, and faith helps defy that sense of isolation.  One of our cultural verities about serious illness is that it often challenges our faith. But for me, if anything, having cancer has only deepened it, heightened it.  I have spent the past year in the dark ark of cancer, and there is no question that I have become a new man. I've been granted a wisdom that only arrives at the rugged confluence of middle age and mortality. And I know, soul deep, that I have not been cut open, radiated, and tried physically and spiritually so that I can merely survive, become a cancer wraith. Since my diagnosis - after shaking off the initial shock - I have kept asking myself, in the context of my belief: What can this cancer teach me?   The most surprising thing I've learned is that cancer can be turned toward blessing. Through the simple fact of me telling my cancer stories on this blog, many of you readers, in turn, have told your own stories. And that mutual sharing of our tales has changed my life for the good.

216,"People with more lean muscle mass may have an advantage when it comes to fighting cancer, new research suggests.  The study, published in the medical journal Lancet Oncology, is the latest to suggest a patient's body composition may play a role in cancer survival rates. Researchers from the University of Alberta used body scan imaging to study 250 obese cancer patients. The scans showed that 15 percent of the cancer patients had very low muscle mass relative to their weight.   The obese patients with the lower levels of lean muscle mass lived an average of 10 months less than patients with more muscle mass, even after controlling for other variables like cancer stage and severity.   Other studies have shown that people who exercise have lower rates of some types of cancer. Although the study suggests that higher levels of lean muscle mass help the body better cope with cancer, it's not clear whether lifting weights prior to or after a diagnosis would improve a patient's odds for surviving the disease. ""That would be the next experiment,'' said Dr. Vickie Baracos, a professor of oncology and adjunct professor of human nutrition at the University of Alberta, and lead author on the study. ""This intervention has not been tested.''  The data also raise questions about whether body composition should be considered as doctors make treatment decisions and assess a patient's prognosis. A patient with very low lean body mass, for instance, may be given a more tailored dose of chemotherapy, Dr. Baracos said.  Patients who have been treated for cancer should talk to their doctor before embarking on any exercise routine. For instance, patients who have undergone lymph node removal are at risk for a severe swelling disorder called lymphedema and may be advised against lifting weights.

290,"Many people gobble big doses of vitamin C in hopes of boosting their immune system and warding off illness. But new research shows that in people with cancer, the vitamin may do more harm than good.  Researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York studied the effects of vitamin C on cancer cells. As it turns out, the vitamin seems to protect not just healthy cells, but cancer cells, too. The findings were published today in the journal Cancer Research.  ""The use of vitamin C supplements could have the potential to reduce the ability of patients to respond to therapy,"" said Dr. Mark Heaney, an associate attending physician at the cancer center.  Dr. Heaney and his colleagues tested five different chemotherapy drugs on cancer cells in the laboratory. Some of the cells were first treated with vitamin C. In every case, including a test of the powerful new cancer drug Gleevec, chemotherapy did not work as well if cells had been exposed to vitamin C. The chemotherapy agents killed 30 to 70 percent fewer cancer cells when the cells were treated with the vitamin.  A second set of experiments implanted cancer cells in mice. They found that the tumors grew more rapidly in mice that were given cancer cells pretreated with vitamin C.  The researchers found that just like healthy cells, cancer cells also benefit from vitamin C. The vitamin appeared to repair a cancer cell's damaged mitochondria, the energy center of cells. When the mitochondria is injured, it sends signals that force the cell to die, but vitamin C interrupts that process.  ""Vitamin C appears to protect the mitochondria from extensive damage, thus saving the cell,"" Dr. Heaney said. ""And whether directly or not, all anticancer drugs work to disrupt the mitochondria to push cell death.""  Dr. Heaney measured the buildup of vitamin C levels in cells and said that the levels of vitamin C used in the experiments were similar to those that would result if a patient took large doses of the vitamin in supplement form. Earlier research at the cancer center showed that vitamin C seems to accumulate within cancer cells more than in normal cells.  Patients should eat a healthy diet that includes foods rich in vitamin C, Dr. Heaney said, but it's the large doses of vitamin C in tablet form that are worrisome.

By Dana Jennings  Long before I started writing publicly about my prostate cancer, I wrote about it for myself.  (Photo: Dana Jennings. (Lonnie Schlein/The New York Times)) Since the mid-'90s, I've kept a journal, mainly to take my mental temperature, and as a hedge against forgetting. I'm one of those people who needs to explain himself to himself. I never truly know what I'm thinking until I'm hunched over a notebook, razor-point pen poised above a blank page.   I wrote my first journal entry about prostate cancer last March, when I learned I had a 50-50 chance of having the disease.  March 19: It makes no sense to freak out right now. And, to be honest, it makes no sense to freak out if I do have cancer.  Since then, my journal has been a record of my highs, lows and everything in between on the cancer road. I never imagined at the time that these very private thoughts would be made public. At first, I was still trying to figure out how to have cancer. I was stunned but trying to be a good stoic, as I'd been taught as a kid back home in New Hampshire.  April 9: I found out two days ago that I have prostate cancer. I'm not angry. I'm not sad. I'm not depressed -- it is what it is. … I wouldn't choose to have cancer, but it does represent the opportunity to engage in an unexpected and serious spiritual adventure.

460,"The majority of people diagnosed with cancer are over 65, but most major cancer studies exclude them, leaving a wide gap in knowledge about how best to treat older patients.  The knowledge gap about older cancer patients was highlighted recently by researchers from Barcelona who studied the role that age played in the prognosis of 224 cancer patients.   According to the National Cancer Institute, 60 percent of newly diagnosed cancers are found in people over the age of 65. Overall, people in this age group are 10 times more likely to get cancer, and 15 times more likely to die from the disease, than are people under the age of 65.  But even though most cancer patients are older, age is typically not the deciding factor in whether someone survives the illness, the Spanish researchers showed. In their study, cancer survival was most affected by how much the cancer had spread at the time of diagnosis. Other issues, like the patient's overall quality of life, also influenced survival. The research was published this month in The International Journal of Clinical Practice.  ""We found that there were a number of factors that influence survival rates -- including physical quality of life and how far the cancer had spread -- but age was not one of them"" said lead researcher Dr. Eva Domingo from Hospital Vall d'Hebron, in a press release. ""Despite this fact, and the challenges that clinicians face from an aging population, there has been little research into how to treat older cancer patients, who often have complex medical needs because of other health issues.''  Dr. Domingo notes that older people are ""systematically excluded"" from many clinical trials. Among cancer patients who participate in clinical trials, only about one in four is over 65, she said.  As a result, doctors know very little about how drug therapies affect older patients. In addition, many doctors lean toward less aggressive treatment for older patients, based on the fact that they have shorter life expectancies or other health problems. But the Barcelona researchers found that whether a person has a high quality of life and functions well are more predictive of cancer survival than issues associated with normal aging.  ""Older people tend to have more complex health needs, such as other illnesses, and that is one of the reasons that has frequently been put forward for not treating their cancers aggressively,'' Dr. Domingo noted. But those factors were ""much less significant'' than factors like quality of life for predicting survival, she said.  ""We would like to see fewer decisions taken on the basis of age and more research that explores the complex needs of older people, so that they can be treated more effectively and enjoy a better quality of life,"" Dr. Domingo said.

Herberman, the director of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, notes that while the evidence about a cellphone-cancer link remains unclear, people should take precautions, particularly for children.  ""Really at the heart of my concern is that we shouldn't wait for a definitive study to come out, but err on the side of being safe rather than sorry later,"" Dr. Herberman told The Associated Press.  Earlier this year, three prominent brain surgeons raised similar concerns while speaking on ""The Larry King Show."" Their concerns were largely based on observational studies that showed only an association between cellphone use and cancer, not a causal relationship. The most important of these studies is called Interphone, a vast research effort in 13 countries, including Canada, Israel and several in Europe.  Some of the research suggests a link between cellphone use and three types of tumors: glioma; cancer of the parotid, a salivary gland near the ear; and acoustic neuroma, a tumor that essentially occurs where the ear meets the brain. All these tumors are rare, so even if cellphone use does increase risk, the risk is still very low.  On Wednesday, Dr. Herberman sent a memo to about 3,000 faculty and staff saying that children should use cellphones only for emergencies because their brains are still developing. He advised adults to keep cellphones away from the head and use the speakerphone or a wireless headset, he said.  ""Although the evidence is still controversial, I am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cellphone use,"" he wrote in his memo.

526,"Every week, New York Times editor Dana Jennings shares his experiences coping with prostate cancer.   By Dana Jennings   (Photo: Dana Jennings. (Lonnie Schlein/The New York Times))  Prostate cancer is a dark waltz, not the raging battle of popular imagination. From that first elevated PSA blood test, to the biopsy, to treatment, to those evil twins of impotence and incontinence and beyond, I'm still learning some very complicated steps more than seven months after my diagnosis.   Cancer is a hard teacher. No matter how much you glean from the Web, how many fellow travelers you talk to, how many questions you ask nurses and doctors, there are some lessons — physical, practical, emotional — that can only be learned firsthand.   I confess that I feel utterly vulnerable. But, as the poet Theodore Roethke wrote, ""Those who are willing to be vulnerable move among the mysteries."" So, as I continue to move among these mysteries, here are 10 nuggets of prostate cancer wisdom that I had to learn for myself.   1) Cancer takes you home. The hardest thing I've had to do since my diagnosis — and that includes having my radical open prostatectomy — was tell my parents that I had prostate cancer. My folks are working-class country people. They're both 68, and they were 17 when I was born in 1957 — eight days after they got married. The three of us, literally, grew up together, and I've always been their little hyper-verbal mystery. They never quite understood why I needed to get the hell out of Kingston, N.H. And when I called them last April to say that I had cancer — maybe, after all these years, confirming their worst fears about life in and around New York City — I could barely speak for my fierce tears. Tears more for them, I know, than for me.   2) Doctors forget to share the gory details. After my prostate was removed, my testicles swelled to the size of shot-puts — bright, red shot-puts — and stayed that way for days. Nobody told me to expect this condition, and only ice brought relief. (Conversely, now that I'm undergoing hormonal therapy, my testicles are shrinking.)   3) Insurance can cause more stress than cancer. The goal of your insurer — no matter how singular or complex your case is — is to try to turn you into a statistical cliché, a cipher, in the face of your very human flesh-and-blood disease. In the months after my diagnosis, as my wife and I struggled to find the right pair of highly-skilled hands to perform my potentially difficult surgery, wrestling with my insurer caused me more grief, stress and depression than my cancer did. In our modern health-care-industrial-complex — and I'm talking about the bureaucrats who try to herd you into the cheapest cattle car available, not the nurses and doctors who are on the front lines — the emphasis is neither on health nor care, but on the bottom line. It's our job, as patients, to resist with all our strength.   Prostate Cancer Journal  One Man's Story ",cancer,10 Lessons of Prostate Cancer,526.0,526.0,526.0,526.0

536,"Last year, 218,000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer, but nobody can tell them what type of treatment is most likely to save their lives.  Those are the findings of a troubling new report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which analyzed hundreds of studies in an effort to advise men about the best treatments for prostate cancer. The report compared the effectiveness and risks of eight prostate cancer treatments, ranging from prostate removal to radioactive implants to no treatment at all. None of the studies provided definitive answers. Surprisingly, no single treatment emerged as superior to doing nothing at all.  ""When it comes to prostate cancer, we have much to learn about which treatments work best,'' said agency director Carolyn M. Clancy. ""Patients should be informed about the benefits and harms of treatment options.""  But the study, published online in the Annals of Internal Medicine, gives men very little guidance. Prostate cancer is typically a slow-growing cancer, and many men can live with it for years, often dying of another cause. But some men have aggressive prostate cancers, and last year 27,050 men died from the disease. The lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer has nearly doubled to 20 percent since the late 1980s, due mostly to expanded use of the prostate-specific antigen, or P.S.A., blood test. But the risk of dying of prostate cancer remains about 3 percent. ""Considerable overdetection and overtreatment may exist,'' an agency press release stated.   The agency review is based on analysis of 592 published articles of various treatment strategies. The studies looked at treatments that use rapid freezing and thawing (cryotherapy); minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopic or robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy); testicle removal or hormone therapy (androgen deprivation therapy); and high-intensity ultrasound or radiation therapy. The study also evaluated research on ""watchful waiting,'' which means monitoring the cancer and initiating treatment only if it appears the disease is progressing.  No one treatment emerged as the best option for prolonging life. And it was impossible to determine whether one treatment had fewer or less severe side effects.  Many of the treatments now in widespread use have never been evaluated in randomized controlled trials. In the research that is available, the characteristics of the men studied varied widely. And investigators used different definitions and methods, making reliable comparisons across studies impossible.   ""Investigators' definitions of adverse events and criteria to define event severity varied widely,'' the report notes. ""We could not derive precise estimates of specific adverse events for each treatment.''  The report findings highlighted by the agency include:   All active treatments cause health problems, primarily urinary incontinence, bowel problems and erectile dysfunction. The chances of bowel problems or sexual dysfunction are similar for surgery and external radiation. Leaking of urine is at least six times more likely among surgery patients than those treated by external radiation.   Urinary leakage that occurs daily or more often was more common in men undergoing radical prostatectomy (35 percent) than external-beam radiation therapy (12 percent) or androgen deprivation (11 percent). Those were the findings of the 2003 Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study, a large, nationally representative survey of men with early prostate cancer.   External-beam radiation therapy and androgen deprivation were each associated with a higher frequency of bowel urgency (3 percent) compared with radical prostatectomy (1 percent), according to the 2003 report.    Inability to attain an erection was higher in men undergoing active intervention, especially androgen deprivation (86 percent) or radical prostatectomy (58 percent) than in men receiving watchful waiting (33 percent), according to the 2003 report.   One study showed that men who choose surgery over watchful waiting are less likely to die or have their cancer spread, but another study found no difference in survival between surgery and watchful waiting. The benefit, if any, appears to be limited to men under 65. However, few patients in the study had cancer detected through P.S.A. tests. As a result, it's not clear if the results are applicable to the majority of men diagnosed with the disease.   Adding hormone therapy prior to prostate removal does not improve survival or decrease recurrence rates, but it does increase the chance of adverse events.   Combining radiation with hormone therapy may decrease mortality. But compared with radiation treatment alone, the combination increases the chances of impotence and abnormal breast development.  The most obvious trend identified in the complicated report is how little quality research exists for prostate cancer, despite the fact that it is the most diagnosed cancer in the country.  Studies comparing brachytherapy, radical prostatectomy, external-beam radiation therapy or cryotherapy were discontinued because of poor recruitment. Two ongoing trials, one in the United States and one in Britain, are evaluating surgery and radiation treatments compared with watchful waiting in men with early cancer. Other studies in progress or development include cryotherapy versus external-beam radiation and a trial evaluating radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting.   ""Successful completion of these studies is needed to provide accurate assessment of the comparative effectiveness and harms of therapies for localized prostate cancers,"" the study authors said.

596,"Times editor Dana Jennings writes each week about coping with an advanced form of prostate cancer.  By Dana Jennings  I'm tired.   I found out 10 months ago that I had prostate cancer. Since then, I've had surgery, started hormone therapy and finished 33 sessions of radiation. And, man, it wears you out.   (Photo: Dana Jennings. (Lonnie Schlein/The New York Times))   But the weariness caused by prostate cancer isn't a constant. It fluctuates from week to week, day to day, even hour to hour. In this nano-age of super-instant gratification, we have lost sense of organic time. Prostate cancer, though, has planted me more firmly in each moment. One of the things that I've learned, as I try to pay attention, is that cancer's paint box includes many shades of fatigue.   It starts with the diagnosis. Knowing that you have cancer exhausts you, stuns you into listlessness. Even so, there's work to be done. There are doctors to be interrogated, a host of tests and scans to be had, treatment decisions to wrestle with and insurers to kick in the shins. With all that going on, it's hard to get a good night's sleep.   Next there's the physical fatigue of treatment. I spent three nights in the hospital after my surgery, and that was the time I experienced fatigue that's beyond fatigue, a fatigue so palpable it seems you could touch it. I wanted to shrivel into the fetal curl of a woolly-bear caterpillar, spin a cocoon of sleep and tell my doctors to wake me when it was time to leave. I learned that sleep is bliss, that sleep heals, that sleep is the essential post-op drug.   At home, I had to accept that my fatigue was in charge. Mornings were especially slow as I creaked and winced out of bed. I felt like an old car that needed to have its crankcase oil heated before it would start.   I soon learned that just shuffling around the block can be draining, that there's power in the spontaneous nap, and that you need to set strict visiting hours. Your fatigue – your body – needs what it needs.   But just because you're spent, it doesn't mean you can sleep at night. I became buddies with the sleep that isn't sleep, staked to my bed by pain and anxiety. No matter where I tucked the pillows, I couldn't get comfortable. No matter how good the music murmuring from the CD player, I couldn't be soothed. (Is that a blood clot floating in my catheter tube?)  A prescription sleeping pill helped solve those problems. For the sake of my wife's repose (and sanity), we decided to sleep in separate beds for two weeks, until I felt better and the catheter was out.   I also dozed off where I least expected to. During radiation, I sometimes napped inside the TomoTherapy machine, lulled in my lassitude by Pink Floyd and Metallica. It was the radiation, which lasted more than seven weeks, that resulted in the most profound fatigue.   Toward the end, I was totally washed out. I felt worn down, like a pencil nub that couldn't possibly be sharpened one more time. It was hard to focus – on reading, on work – I wasn't listening as well, my legs were heavy. It took just one stout with supper to knock me out for the night.   Even now, a month after my last radiation session, the fatigue still swells late in the afternoon and breaks over me. When 5 o'clock rolls around I'm more zombie than employee. I'm in bed by 10 most nights. And weekend naps are nonnegotiable.   There's one more subtle shade of fatigue: the fatigue of talking about your cancer. From the diagnosis, through treatment and after, the well-meaning questions seem to never stop. How are you feeling? What's your Gleason? Where's your P.S.A.? Will you need chemo?   It sometimes feels as if you have become your cancer or, at the very least, its spokesman. And it can be wearing. But I found that it's crucial to shake off that languor and learn to speak. Sleep heals, but talking heals, too.   Like Scheherazade and her 1,001 nights of stories, I think we tell our tales so that we, and others, can stay alive -- no matter how tired we might get.

653,"A particularly fast-growing form of breast cancer should be treated aggressively after surgery even when tumors are very small, according to new research that could dramatically alter treatment for one in five women diagnosed with breast cancer.  The research, reported on Friday at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, focuses on the 15 percent to 20 percent of women with breast cancer who test positive for an amplification of the HER2 gene, which is typically among the most aggressive forms of the disease.  Today, a targeted therapy called Herceptin, made by biotech firm Genentech, has greatly improved the odds for women with HER2-positive cancer. Recent studies show the drug reduces the recurrence of these cancers by about half.   But current treatment guidelines do not recommend that the drug be given to women with HER2-positive tumors less than one-half centimeter in size. The guidelines also suggest only that doctors discuss Herceptin treatment with women who have tumors between one-half and one centimeter in size.  The latest study finds that women with early-stage small tumors may have much to gain from aggressive treatment. Researchers at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center reviewed data from 965 women treated between 1990 and 2002 who had tumors less than one centimeter in size. They also studied 350 patients from European institutions.  They found that after five years, 23 percent of women with very small HER2-positive tumors experienced a return of the cancer, compared to just 6 percent of similar women without HER2 disease. That finding indicates that even among women who catch their cancers early, the risk of recurrence is nearly three times greater if they test positive for HER2 than if they do not. None of the women in the study received Herceptin treatment.  Although the data on recurrence strongly suggest that women with early-stage HER2-positive cancer could benefit from aggressive treatment, the study did not study the effectiveness of Herceptin in women with small tumors. Women with small but aggressive tumors should be included in clinical trials comparing current practices with more aggressive treatment, said Dr. Ana M. Gonzalez-Angulo, assistant professor at M.D. Anderson.  Herceptin is a so-called targeted therapy because it attacks particular mechanisms used by tumors to grow or survive. The drug binds to the HER-2 protein and prevents it from being activated. Treatment with Herceptin carries some risks, however, and there are no meaningful data to help women with early-stage disease weigh the risks against the benefits of using the drug.   Herceptin causes flu-like symptoms in about 40 percent of the patients who take it. Of more concern is the fact that Herceptin can damage the heart, and on rare occasions patients who have used the drug experience life-threatening congestive heart failure or stroke.  The study was funded by a grant from the National Cancer Institute. ",cancer,New Research on Breast Cancer Treatment,653.0,653.0,653.0,653.0

Now the brush itself seems to decide what to paint.  ""I paint what comes out,"" she said. ""It's not intellectual — it's instinctive.""  She paints rapidly, and her images are primal and powerful. There are insistent brush strokes, bold colors and bleak backgrounds. There are faces laughing and others cringing. There are winged characters flying into the beyond. There are people hugging each other. Different as they are, she said, they all reflect aspects of her condition....  She said her painting style is shaped by one thing: ""I have nothing to lose.""

Height appears to play less of a role than other known prostate cancer risk factors like age, family history and race. As a result, men shouldn't make screening or treatment decisions based on their height. But the findings may open up a new line of scientific inquiry into the causes of prostate cancer.  Researchers from four universities in England studied more than 9,000 men with and without prostate cancer and found that the tallest men had a 19 percent higher risk of developing prostate cancer than shorter men. Using the shortest men as a baseline, the study showed that risk increased 6 percent for every additional 4 inches in height. The report, published in the September issue of Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, showed an even stronger association between height and aggressive cancers.  ""Compared to other risk factors, the magnitude of the additional risk of being taller is small, and we do not believe that it should interfere with preventive or clinical decisions in managing prostate cancer,"" said the study's lead author, Luisa Zuccolo, of the department of social medicine at the University of Bristol. ""But the insight arising from this research is of great scientific interest.''  The increased risk likely is explained by factors associated with height, such as the insulin-like growth factor-1 system, which stimulates cell growth and has been shown to be involved in prostate cancer incidence and progression. The researchers also analyzed 58 other studies and found evidence that greater stature is associated with a modest increase in prostate cancer risk.  A woman's height also is associated with breast cancer risk. Women who are 5-feet-9 or taller have a small increase in risk of both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer compared to women 5-feet-3 or shorter.

824,"(Photo: Joseph Ho/Guardian Protesters at the University of California, San Diego, are lobbying school administrators to address a ""cancer cluster"" linked to a campus building.)   A building on the University of California, San Diego, campus is being blamed for a cluster of breast cancer cases, raising new questions about the risks of exposure to electromagnetic fields.  Last week, students and professors marched and carried signs to protest what they called a ""crisis of safety,'' claiming that the university has failed to address worries that the campus literature building is the site of an inordinate number of cancer cases. The protesters delivered a petition signed by more than 1,300 people to the university chancellor, Marye Anne Fox, according to a report in the university's newspaper, The Guardian.   At least eight workers in the campus building have been diagnosed with breast cancer since 2000, and a handful of other cancers, including ovarian and salivary gland cancers, have also been reported. The number of breast cancer cases alone is significantly more than would have been expected by chance, according to a June analysis by Cedric Garland, an epidemiologist at the university. In that report, he notes that the risk of invasive breast cancer for employees in the literature building appears to be four to five times higher than that of the general California population. To read the full report, click here.  Building workers and researchers are concerned the source of the problem may be the building's elevators, which rest on the first floor and emit an electromagnetic field. According to the report from Dr. Garland:  The issue of the etiological role of EMF in breast cancer is still not resolved with final scientific certainty, despite decades of research. However, the lack of such certainty should not be a reason to avoid taking moderate measures to minimize needless exposure of workers to power frequency EMF.  According to The Guardian, the University ""has vacated areas with risk of exposure to high EMF levels"" and replaced elevator motor devices and other fixtures to reduce generation of electromagnetic fields. A University of California, Los Angeles, researcher, Leeka Kheifets, has been asked to continue the investigation, although critics are wary of her ties to the Electric Power Research Institute, an arm of the electric utility industry, according to a report in Microwave News.   The university has created a Web site where it summarizes the literature building study as well as the interim safety measures it has taken, as well as links to scientific literature on electromagnetic fields and cancer.

New York Times editor Dana Jennings, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier this year, talks about his own treatment with the drug Lupron.  By Dana Jennings   The day after my most recent hormone injection for prostate cancer, I told my wife, Deb, that I had a headache, hot flashes, cramps and was very, very hungry.  (Photo: Dana Jennings. (Lonnie Schlein/The New York Times))   She said, ""Sweetie, you're having your period."" We both laughed. (Laughter is a crucial therapy in my treatment.)   Those are just a few of the side effects I've been experiencing on Lupron, which is part of the hormonal treatment for my advanced case of prostate cancer. Lupron is a testosterone suppressant, designed to starve hormone-dependent cancer cells of the fuel (testosterone) that they crave in order to grow. My doctors believe, and studies indicate, that using hormonal therapy to complement my radiation treatments, which are scheduled to start next month, will give me a better chance of being cured, of survival.   In the past couple weeks, I've also had back, joint and muscle aches, random itchiness: that spider-crawling-on-your-skin feeling, cotton mouth, sudden fatigue and fleeting bursts of pain in my jaw, chest and armpits. These are not complaints, just observations.   Oh, and my testicles are shrinking. There's also intermittent testicle tenderness and, sometimes, they get so warm they feel as if they're on simmer. And the most unexpected side effect, so far, is that sometimes during sex, a Lupron headache suddenly descends and hammers at my skull.   Essentially, my Lupron shots are inducing biochemical (but reversible) castration. Besides the hot flashes and shrinking testicles, another potential side effect is that a man's breasts grow larger and more sensitive. Now, I'll tell you straight up, no doctor ever sits you down and says, ""Son, to cure you, we might have to kind of turn you into a woman."" I suspect that some men would almost rather die than have hot flashes and larger breasts.    Prostate Cancer Journal  One Man's Story ",cancer,Real Men Get Prostate Cancer,1046.0,1046.0,1046.0,1046.0

The congresswoman revealed over the weekend that for the last year, she had battled breast cancer and had undergone seven major surgeries, including a double mastectomy and removal of her ovaries, all without skipping most beats on Capitol Hill or public events at home during her re-election in campaign. She disclosed her battle -- including her decisions to have such cancer-prone areas removed because of a genetic predisposition -- to the Miami Herald on Saturday, and during an interview this morning on ABC's ""Good Morning America.""  Ms. Wasserman Schultz, who is in her early 40s, said she didn't release the news publicly for a few reasons. ""I really wanted to make sure that I could protect my children; they were 8 and 4,"" she said in the interview She has twins who are now 9.    Elected to her third term while she was privately dealing with the illness and surgeries, she also didn't want her identifying ""tag line"" to be ""congresswoman battling breast cancer,"" she said. Much of her surgery was scheduled during congressional breaks, she said in the interviews, indicating that she's well now but would be taking Tamoxifen for several years.   Rather, she waited until just before rolling out her initiative today to promote an educational campaign aimed at younger women, in their 20s and 30s, in an effort to counter the prevailing 40-plus emphasis on when to get mammograms regularly. Younger women tend to think they're invincible, she said, so she hopes that she can push for legislation that would enhance knowledge among younger women, too. ",cancer,Fla.

1121,"This week, Dr. John Mulhall, director of the Male Sexual and Reproductive Medicine Program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, has been taking questions on the Well blog about what to expect following treatment for prostate cancer. Today, Dr. Mulhall, author of Saving Your Sex Life: A Guide for Men With Prostate Cancer, answers questions about exploring treatment options, effects of treatment on erectile function and penile rehabilitation after cancer treatments. Next week, Dr. Mulhall will answer questions about testosterone, alternative remedies and implants, and other treatments to restore sexual function.  My husband was just diagnosed with prostate cancer today. His cancer is localized in the prostate and his Gleason score is low. He is 63. What course of treatment do you recommend? -- Naomi  The vast majority of men, when they are diagnosed with prostate cancer, have Gleason scores of 5, 6 or 7. Scores of 8, 9 and 10 are aggressive, but if you have a score of 7 or less, you have time -- months -- to make your decision. You do not need to be wracked with fear.   There are some key messages we need to transmit to patients, one of which is to start looking at medical evidence. If you go to a surgeon, he will almost certainly recommend having the prostate removed. If you see a radiation oncologist, you'll most likely be offered radiation. So, it's difficult for patients to sift through the data.   My recommendation is to sit down and talk to more than one surgeon and more than one radiation oncologist. If you're on the fence and can't make a decision, go see somebody like me or an oncologist who specializes in prostate cancer -- someone who doesn't do the surgery and who doesn't do the radiation. That person can give you a rational approach for how you should look at that data.    Why don't we hear more about proton therapy as a treatment for prostate cancer? -- Teresa  I have heard a lot of advertising about a treatment device called the CyberKnife. Should a patient consider this alternative? -- John  Proton beam therapy and CyberKnife are both forms of radiation therapy. There is absolutely no evidence that erection function is better when patients have proton therapy or Cyberknife compared to standard radiation approaches like seed implantation (brachytherapy) or external beam radiation (3D-CRT or IMRT).   There is a lot of marketing going on. A good radiation oncologist combined with modern technology is what will get you the best result. Furthermore, there is no evidence that robotic prostatectomy has better outcomes than open prostatectomy. American men appear enthralled with gadgetry. They think lasers must be better and that using a robot must be better than standard surgery.   Choose your surgeon, not the approach he or she uses. There is no doubt the figures on hospital stay, blood loss and return to work are better for robotic prostatectomy, but at this time there is no evidence that robotic prostatectomy has better outcomes for erectile function or urinary function than open surgery.  What I tell patients who come to see me who are trying to decide between surgery and radiation is as follows: If you look at the data at three years after treatment, surgery or radiation, based on available evidence, there appears to be no significant difference in erectile dysfunction (ED) rates between the two. After surgery, virtually everyone has significant erectile dysfunction for the first 6 to 12 months. Then it improves. After radiation, very few men have ED in the first year, then between years one and three there is likely to be a reduction in erectile function. At about three years, both treatments have approximately the same rates of ED.  The key factors for patients to appreciate are to find physicians who have a high volume of procedures, and a surgeon or radiation oncologist who has been doing this for a while. Outcomes after radical prostatectomy, for example, are better when a surgeon has done 250 procedures and is likely doing more than 50 per year. Experience is important. Of note, surgeons who used to do open prostatectomy and who now do robotic surgery reset the clock, that is, their learning curve starts from close to zero again. So, if a surgeon experienced in open surgery starts to do robotic surgery it may take him or her more than 100 cases to get to the same level of expertise that he or she had when doing open surgery.    My husband had Robot Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy in February and is using Viagra on nights he does not use injections. I can't understand why, when drugs like Viagra are prescribed post-prostatectomy, prescription insurance plans refuse to pay for the drugs. -- G.H.  The evidence shows that the concept called penile rehabilitation provides some benefit to the recovery of erectile function. This approach involves the use of medications (pills or injections) to increase blood flow and oxygen going into the penis. Oxygen is critically important for the health of erectile tissue. When you're not getting erections, you're not oxygenating the penis and not preserving erectile tissue health.   As men, we get three erections every night of our lives before surgery. After surgery, this is not the case for at least the first year. You should think of your penis like you would your biceps. It's predominantly a muscle. If you're not using it, atrophy may occur, and atrophy in the penis is a permanent problem. There is evidence that half of men who go a year without any erection have irreversible structural damage to their erectile tissue.   The vast majority of urologists are doing penile rehabilitation in some form or fashion. Insurance coverage is a huge problem. The general figures are that about one third of men have coverage for Viagra -- the average number of pills per month is six. One-third have no coverage, and one-third have minimal coverage where they have to pay most of the cost of the drug anyway. Men using the drugs for penile rehabilitation use 10 to 15 pills per month.  I would encourage patients to be proactive before surgery or radiation and ask their doctors about rehabilitation and erectile tissue preservation. Before your treatment, set up a plan for how you are going to do rehab. We now start treating patients before surgery and before radiation.    I understand the doctor's foremost goal is to cure you of cancer. My question is, why are doctors so loathe to discuss the virtually inevitable changes in sexual abilities post cancer treatment? I personally found it was one of the larger black-holes of information from my medical professionals. I had to become educated by my own personal experiences over time -- Thomas  Most physicians want to help their patients. They want to do the right thing. However, most physicians are pretty uncomfortable talking about sexual problems. On average, there are less than one to two hours of sexual health education in most medical schools in the United States.   Another problem is many physicians use ""ballpark"" figures based on data in the literature from major centers. And so they say, ""We know 90 percent of men retain erectile function.'' But that's only true in very select centers and certain men.   I would say to any patient or partner who speaks to a physician who is evasive about the data on urinary function and sexual function: they are not a good match for you. That's a warning sign you should be seeking another opinion.   Do you think pretreatment counseling about erectile dysfunction would ease the potential sexual/relationship problems that may arise as a consequence of having radical prostatectomy? -- Leah  Unquestionably. I don't think patients necessarily have to see a mental health professional, but what patients need are realistic expectations.   One of the travesties I see in my practice is patients aren't given realistic expectations. Many patients are told that ""in six months, you'll be fine."" But if you're been told it will be six months, and you get to month nine and you're not functioning, you get depressed and a sense of hopelessness sets in. For a man, when his erections aren't working, he becomes avoidant of all physical contact. Many wives say, ""He doesn't even hold my hand. He doesn't even sit on the couch with me anymore.'' And so, there is an interruption in the couple's physical intimacy, which if it lasts for a prolonged period of time may be difficult to reestablish.  It's important for doctors to have a conversation up-front with people, informing them that it could take 18 to 24 months after prostatectomy to return to normal function or that it may take three-plus years after radiation before maximum erectile dysfunction is experienced. There are things we can do, but it may take time for erections to come back.   Another thing that is important for the prostatectomy patient to know: one in four men we see are not aware that they will never ejaculate after surgery, again highlighting the reticence of many physicians to discuss sexual issues.

1152,"Hamilton Jordan, the former White House chief of staff for President Jimmy Carter, was a well-known force in the health community. During the past 24 years he battled four different forms of cancer and urged cancer patients to empower themselves with information.  (Photo: Hamilton Jordan, left, walked the White House grounds with President Jimmy Carter in this undated photo. (Ruth Fremson/The New York Times))   After bouts with non-Hodgkins lymphoma, prostate cancer and skin cancer, Mr. Jordan, 63, yesterday died as a result of mesothelioma, another form of cancer. Mr. Jordan often speculated that his lymphoma may have resulted from exposure to the chemical Agent Orange while serving as a volunteer during the Vietnam War. Mesothelioma also has been linked to the chemical.  In his 2001 memoir, ""No Such Thing as a Bad Day,'' Mr. Jordan outlined his ""Top 10 Tips for Cancer Patients.'' He spoke about them during this undated interview with WebMD. Here they are:  No. 1: Be an active partner in the medical decisions that are made about your life.   Don't be passive. Learn about your disease, and participate in the decisions that are made....For example with my lymphoma, if I would have accepted the first treatment offered, I'd be dead today. It was assumed that I only had a mass in my chest. I later learned that the lymphoma was all through my body.    No. 2: Seek and know the truth about your illness, and prognosis.    If you don't have the facts, and don't know the truth, you won't make good decisions. It takes courage to ask questions about statistics and your prognosis.     No. 3: Get a second opinion.     We wouldn't buy the first computer or cellphone we looked at. Shop around when your life is at stake....I got second opinions on all of my cancers.    No. 4: Determine upfront how broad or narrow your physicians' experience is.    If you have something that your doctor says, ""I've never seen this before,"" get another doctor. You want your doctor to be very familiar with your disease.    No. 5: If you have a poor prognosis, or a rare form of cancer, try to get to a center of excellence.    If your doctor doesn't believe he or she can cure you, you won't believe you'll be cured.     No. 6: Do not allow your caregivers to project their values, goals and expectations onto you.    In my book I tell the story of a 68-year-old man who was diagnosed with PCa (prostate cancer). And this man is in very good health other than the PCa. His 35-year-old doctor reasoned that since his life expectancy was only five or six years, that he recommended that the man do nothing for his PCa and told him it would take the PCa four or five years to kill him. This man wanted to live to be 80 or 85. He didn't accept that. He had his prostate removed, and many years later he's in good health, and probably will live to be 80 or 85. Don't let your doctor project his or her expectations in life out on you.    No. 7: Understand the economics of cancer care.    You don't want to be in a situation where your doctor wants to run a $150 test that your insurance doesn't cover, but it contains critical information for making your diagnosis or deciding treatment. You need to understand what your insurance covers, and let your doctor know what you're willing to do to supplement that coverage to get a good diagnosis, and the best possible treatment. If your doctor says that he wants to run another test, but insurance won't pay for it, find out what it is. Why does he want to run it? Find out the cost, and determine whether you should pay it yourself. It might save your life.    No. 8: Ultimately, find a doctor that you trust and believe in.    Find a doctor with a fighting spirit, and who thinks that they can cure you. You tend to find doctors that reflect your own attitude. I always found doctors that liked the fact I was aggressive and going to fight for my life. They didn't object to my asking a lot of questions.    No. 9: Treat your mind as well as your body.    Just because we can't quantify, and don't understand the power of the mind, to deal with disease, it doesn't mean that attitude and the will to live is not a powerful, powerful force in the course of an illness.    No. 10: Your attitude and beliefs are your most powerful weapon against cancer.     I believe that deeply. There have been studies that show when you are happy and engaged and positive, your immune system is at its strongest. When you are depressed or unhappy, your immune system is weakened.

1154,"(Photo: A standard mammogram, left, and molecular breast imaging (M.B.I.), right, of a patient's dense breast tissue. A tumor is visible on the M.B.I., as in indicated by the arrow, but not on the mammogram. (AP))   Two big developments in breast cancer research are making headlines and generating buzz among scientists: one a new diagnostic option, the second a potential way to reduce the time patients must spend in radiation treatment. Each is promising, but there are some important points that are not yet clear.  Let's start with diagnosis. The problem with diagnosing breast cancer as early as possible is that the breast itself is not a completely uniform structure. It has several components -- fat, fibers, ducts and water, among them -- that give it a rather complex appearance when viewed by mammography (x-rays of the breast), ultrasound or MRI scans. Tumors also vary in appearance, some of them closely resembling normal breast tissue.  Diagnosing breast cancer becomes particularly difficult when the tumor is small or when the breast tissue itself is very variable in its consistency. It can be surprisingly difficult for a physician to decide whether a particular area with an ""odd"" appearance represents tumor, scar tissue, fat or something else.  New technology, called molecular breast imaging, appears to detect some tumors that were previously unseen. With this technique, small breast cancers absorb a type of radioactive molecule that can then be detected by a special camera. Molecular breast imaging has been used successfully in some screening studies (that is, in well women without known symptoms or breast lumps) to detect unsuspected small tumors, which in some cases had been missed by mammography.  Unfortunately this technology also requires a small radiation dose, and that may present hazards, too. Doctors working with molecular breast imaging also have reported that the technique occasionally may miss a tumor that would have been picked up on routine mammography.   At present, then, it seems that this screening method may be most useful as an adjunct to established techniques, rather than as a replacement for them. Since there is a small amount of radiation associated with molecular breast imaging, as there is also in mammography, patients also will have to be followed carefully to ensure that there are no after-effects.  The Times also reports today that the duration of radiation treatment in early-stage breast cancer can perhaps be shortened for many patients. Recent studies from Canada and Japan have suggested that instead of the usual five to seven weeks of treatment, patients may survive just as long if they are treated with larger individual doses of radiotherapy each day for just a few weeks. This finding applies only to patients with small tumors that have not spread to the lymph nodes.  Shorter duration of radiotherapy seems like a good idea, as it would reduce the time away from work or from family duties. What's the downside?   Larger individual doses of radiation can sometimes cause more side effects, such as inflammation of breast tissue, hardening of the skin over the breast and local discomfort during the radiation. Unfortunately, some of these complications may occur well after treatment is complete. It may be premature to call this strategy a complete success, although it is worth noting that patients were followed for 12 years in the recently published Canadian study.  Cancer cells may protect and repair themselves after radiation, and some are actually more efficient at this repair process after shorter courses of radiotherapy. While these recent studies suggest that equivalent results can be obtained by either short- or long- course radiation, more studies will be required, focusing on cure rates and late effects.   So what should patients make of all this? Molecular breast imaging is a work in progress, and the centers investigating it will have to continue to monitor women to see whether tumors are missed, and whether those small doses of radiation are in some way harmful.   With regard to short-course radiotherapy, I think that a reasonable approach is to consider the context. Women who have important reasons for trying to spend less time on radiotherapy (the single parent who is the sole financial support for her family, or the woman who must travel long distances to a treatment facility) might reasonably choose this option, recognizing that there MAY be more risk, but that the level of risk is reasonable, based on these recent studies.  On the other hand, for women for whom time saved merely relates to convenience, it would probably be smart to stick with tried-and-true techniques until more data are available. The benefit of the established treatment programs is that they are very well anchored, with lots of information about safety, side effects and cure rates.

2000,"The death rate from cervical cancer in the United States is considerably higher than previously estimated and the disparity in death rates between black women and white women is significantly wider, according to a study published Monday in the journal Cancer. The rate at which black American women are dying from the disease is comparable to that of women in many poor developing nations, researchers reported. What makes the findings especially disturbing, said experts not involved in the research, is that when screening guidelines and   monitoring are pursued, cervical cancer is largely preventable. Ã¢ÂÂThis shows that our disparities are even worse than we feared,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Kathleen M. Schmeler, an associate professor of gynecologic oncology at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Ã¢ÂÂWe have screenings that are great, but many women in America are not getting them. And now I have even more concerns going forward, with theÃ¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ   expected  Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂrepeal of the Affordable Care Act, which covers screening, and the closing of family planning clinics, which do much of that screening. Ã¢ÂÂ The racial disparity had been noted in earlier studies, but it had been thought to have narrowed because cervical cancer death rates for black women were declining. But this study said that the gap was far greater than believed. In the new analysis, the mortality rate for black women was 10. 1 per 100, 000. For white women, it is 4. 7 per 100, 000. Previous studies had put those figures at 5. 7 and 3. 2. The new rates do not reflect a rise in the number of deaths, which recent estimates put at more than 4, 000 a year in the United States. Instead, the figures come from a   of existing numbers, in an adjusted context. Typically, death rates for cervical cancer are calculated by assessing the number of women who die from a disease against the general population at risk for it. But these epidemiologists, who looked at health data from 2000 to 2012, also excluded women who had had hysterectomies from that larger population. A hysterectomy almost always removes the cervix, and thus the possibility that a woman will develop cervical cancer. Ã¢ÂÂWe donÃ¢ÂÂt include men in our calculation because they are not at risk for cervical cancer and by the same measure, we shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt include women who donÃ¢ÂÂt have a cervix,Ã¢ÂÂ said Anne F. Rositch, the lead author and an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Ã¢ÂÂIf we want to look at how well our programs are doing, we have to look at the women weÃ¢ÂÂre targeting. Ã¢ÂÂ Although the study did not explore reasons for the racial disparity, some doctors said it could reflect unequal access to screening, ability to pursue   test results, and insurance coverage. A recent study in the journal Gynecologic Oncology that looked at 15, 194 patients with advanced cervical cancer found that more than half did not receive treatment considered to be standard of care, and that those patients were more likely to be black and poor. According to the analysis published Monday, the   mortality rates put black American women on par with women living in some underdeveloped countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa, particularly in   Africa. Certainly removing women who had hysterectomies from the data pool had a significant effect. About 20 percent of women in the United States have a hysterectomy, often for problems unrelated to cancer, like excessive bleeding and fibroids, with prevalence higher among black women than white. In years to come, mortality and incidence rates should decline as more women receive HPV vaccines, which prevents many cervical cancers. In recent years, with recognition of the slow progression of the disease, the success of the vaccine and more sophisticated screening tests, guidelines for cervical cancer assessments have shifted. Depending on circumstances, some women need to be screened only every five years. The guidelines suggest that screening end at age 65 for women who have had two or three consecutive negative results in the previous decade. The current study says that the greatest mortality rates hit black women 85 and older. But experts said the new findings did not necessarily point to the need to revisit the upper end of the guidelines. Cervical cancer progresses so slowly, with so many   stages, experts said, that it is highly unlikely that a    woman who had met guidelinesÃ¢ÂÂ requirements would subsequently develop the disease. But given the rigor of the guidelines and screenings, Dr. Rositch said, why do American women not only still get cervical cancer but die from it? And with such pronounced racial and age divides? Dr. Otis W. Brawley, the chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, said that the new study pointed to inequity of access and good treatment. Ã¢ÂÂWhen we look at the difference between black and white, and rich and poor, we find the same disparity,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂThe quality of assessment and   treatment can be different. The question becomes: how do we get adequate preventive care to all people?Ã¢ÂÂ Although this study looked at the divide between black and white women, Dr. Schmeler said that it implicitly raised alarms for other poor women of color. Along border towns in Texas, with an overwhelmingly poor, Hispanic population, she said that rates of incidence and death from cervical cancer were considerably higher than national figures. Studies such as this latest one consider death rates from a broad epidemiological perspective statistically, its grimmest news is about older black women. But on the ground, Dr. M. Margaret Kemeny, the director of the Queens Cancer Center of Queens Hospital, a public institution in New York, said she had treated many younger women of color with a diagnosis of cervical cancer. Although the disease is preventable and, if detected early, treatable, Dr. KemenyÃ¢ÂÂs patients have often never had Pap smears. She recently had to perform total pelvic exenterations on two women, each with recurring cervical cancer, one Chinese, the other Hispanic. She removed the cervix, vagina, rectum and bladder, inserting two ostomy bags, which are worn outside the body to collect urine and stool. Ã¢ÂÂOne was 39,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Kemeny said, Ã¢ÂÂand the other was 25. Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,Wider Racial Gap Found in Cervical Cancer Deaths - The New York Times,2000.0,2000.0,0.0,
2001,"They treaded water for seven hours before a neighbor heard their screams. On Oct. 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy flooded Staten Island. As the storm surge peaked at 14 feet in the borough  Ã¢ÂÂ   among the highest levels across New York City  Ã¢ÂÂ   the water crashed through the walls of their house, and DeBraan Varvaro and her younger sister, Carolyn Varvaro, clung to the gutter of their roof and did not let go. They waved frantically as helicopters circled overhead, but no one saw or heard them over the roaring water. Ã¢ÂÂWe could swim before we could walk,Ã¢ÂÂ the elder Ms. Varvaro said of her childhood on Staten IslandÃ¢ÂÂs beaches and teenage years as a lifeguard. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre ocean people. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why we survived. Ã¢ÂÂ Her sister grew tired in the water, and Ms. Varvaro held her up as she treaded water. In the second hour, a garden statue of the Virgin Mary floated past. The younger Ms. Varvaro saw it as a sign they would survive. She kicked with renewed hope. Finally, at 6 p. m. a neighbor, crouched in his attic, heard the womenÃ¢ÂÂs screams. He helped them get the attention of more neighbors, and a young man swam through the water, filled with sewage, dead fish and gasoline, to pull them out. They were safe. But everything changed after the storm. They no longer felt safe. Over four years later, the night of the hurricane, and all the nights after, still haunt them. The elder Ms. Varvaro, now 61, a pack of her favorite Seneca cigarettes within reach, recalled in a recent interview the continuing terror, while propping her legs on a stool to ease back pain from a 1993 car accident. She cried, stopping at times midthought to find the words to describe her ordeal. Ms. Varvaro had feared displacing her sister, who is schizophrenic, so they decided to stay. The night before Hurricane Sandy hit, however, they called 911 for help, but the line was busy and they could not get through. They were among 236, 000 residents in impacted zones who did not evacuate their home before the storm, according to city estimates. Now, the sound of sirens still puts Ms. Varvaro in a panic, jolting her back to the hours spent treading water and praying for help. When she tries to sleep, she said, she hears Ã¢ÂÂthe    of the helicopters circling overhead. Ã¢ÂÂ She did not return to the beach until last summer. Ã¢ÂÂI couldnÃ¢ÂÂt even get to the boardwalk,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂd have to stop. I could still smell the storm. Ã¢ÂÂ In 2012, Ms. Varvaro was told that she had   stress disorder. Even before the storm, her life had its difficulties. Pregnant at 23, she almost lost the pregnancy twice because of medical complications, but gave birth to a healthy daughter. The next year, in 1979, she learned she had cervical cancer, underwent surgery and fought it off. But it returned aggressively 10 years later, and she fought it again. Everything seemed fine until 2000, when the cancer returned a third time. She has been free of cancer since surgery in May 2000, and hopes to keep the disease in the past. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve met the devil and survived,Ã¢ÂÂ she said with a shrug. Ã¢ÂÂI came out the winner. Ã¢ÂÂ Before her last bout with cancer, she met Kevin Killea, a sales representative, and they were together for 16 years. He died of pneumonia in 2010, and she has been alone since, except for her sister. Ms. Varvaro has been protecting and caring for her sister, who is four years her junior, since they were young. As a child, her sister often had high fevers and seizures that led to a loss of hearing Ms. Varvaro learned sign language so they could communicate. Surgery restored her hearing several years later. Ms. Varvaro has also helped her sister cope with paranoid schizophrenia and clinical depression, diagnoses she received after their mother died in 1999. Ã¢ÂÂTheyÃ¢ÂÂre only labels,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Varvaro said. Ã¢ÂÂI tell my sister, Ã¢ÂÂOther people need them. You donÃ¢ÂÂt. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ She added: Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm a shy person until it comes to my sister, and then the bulldog comes out. I fight for the people I love. I will go for the jugular and ask God for forgiveness later. Ã¢ÂÂ When her sister, who had been living in a supportive apartment program, had a nervous breakdown in 2003, after verbal abuse and neglect, she moved her to another such program. Ms. Varvaro said she had lodged a complaint with local officials against the previous program. It was later shut down. But in August 2009, her sister had another breakdown at the second residence. Ms. Varvaro then brought her home to live with her in her apartment on Staten Island. When they moved in together, Ms. Varvaro promised to keep her sister safe. After the storm, she felt she had failed her. She asked for her sisterÃ¢ÂÂs forgiveness. Ã¢ÂÂI think all the struggles IÃ¢ÂÂve survived in life were in preparation for taking care of my sister,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Varvaro said. By attending to her sisterÃ¢ÂÂs needs, however, Ms. Varvaro suppressed her own anxiety. In 2014, a friend referred her to an art class and other services provided by the Jewish Community Center of Staten Island, a beneficiary agency of   of New York, one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Working in watercolors and pastels, she painted a small sailboat flitting in the choppy water of a dark storm. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm no Picasso,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂBut it got me out of this house. It got me out of myself. Ã¢ÂÂ The art classes have been a welcome break from financial troubles that were compounded after the hurricane. The family received $10, 000 from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to cover losses  Ã¢ÂÂ   well under what the sisters needed. They were unable to return to their first apartment together and the garden they tended daily with colorful annuals and window boxes by the kitchen. Since 2009, Ms. VarvaroÃ¢ÂÂs back injury and other health problems have kept her from working as an emergency medical technician, a job she had held for 13 years. Her sister has never been able to work because of her mental illness. Together they receive $1, 736 in Social Security income and disability benefits. They also receive $375 a month in food stamps and a $575 rent subsidy from the city. They now share a     apartment that is accessible only by a long, narrow staircase, which is difficult for the elder Ms. Varvaro to climb because of her arthritis and fibromyalgia. The Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, another   beneficiary, provided them with $850 in Neediest funds to cover one monthÃ¢ÂÂs rent in 2014. In September, they also received $1, 170 from the fund to replace the younger Ms. VarvaroÃ¢ÂÂs broken bed and to buy a therapeutic mattress for her sister, which has greatly improved her sleep. The elder Ms. Varvaro hopes they can eventually move into a     apartment. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve been to hell and back,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂNow I just want to help my sister have peace of mind. IÃ¢ÂÂm ready to live again. Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,"Ã¢ÂÂTo Hell and BackÃ¢ÂÂ as a Cancer Survivor, Storm Victim and Caregiver - The New York Times",2001.0,2001.0,1.0,
2002,"Men whose prostate cancer comes back after surgery are more likely to survive if, along with the usual radiation, they also take drugs to block male hormones. The finding, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, comes from a   study that experts say will help clarify treatment for many patients. After surgery to remove the prostate, more than 30 percent of men have a recurrence, and until now there has not been clear evidence about the best way to stop the disease from killing them. Most are given radiation, but prescribing drugs to counter the effects of male hormones has been inconsistent. The study, paid for by the National Cancer Institute, showed that among men who received radiation and hormonal treatment, 76. 3 percent were still alive after 12 years, compared to 71. 3 percent who had radiation alone. At 12 years, the men who had both treatments were also much less likely to have died from their prostate cancer  Ã¢ÂÂ   5. 8 percent versus 13. 4 percent  Ã¢ÂÂ   or to have the cancer spread around their bodies  Ã¢ÂÂ   14. 5 percent versus 23 percent. Ã¢ÂÂThis is a big deal,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Ian M. Thompson Jr. of the Christus Santa Rosa Health System in San Antonio, who was not part of the study but wrote an editorial accompanying it. Ã¢ÂÂThere are so many things we do in prostate cancer that we donÃ¢ÂÂt know if they make a big difference in survival. This is one of the things where now we can say for sure. Ã¢ÂÂ He added that he hoped the findings would change medical practice. The medical term for blocking male hormones is chemical castration, and the treatments can cause hot flashes, sexual problems and other side effects. So to put a man through it, said Dr. Anthony L. Zietman, an author of the study, Ã¢ÂÂyouÃ¢ÂÂd better have some decent justification. Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. David F. Penson, the chairman of urologic surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said the study Ã¢ÂÂgives more credence to the concept that you have to treat the whole patient,Ã¢ÂÂ rather than just irradiating the area where the cancer used to be. He said the idea of blocking hormones in men like those in the study was finding its way into medical practice. About 161, 360 new cases of prostate cancer and 26, 730 deaths are expected in the United States in 2017, according to the American Cancer Society. The average age at diagnosis is 66. Globally, there were 1. 1 million cases and 307, 000 deaths in 2012, the most recent data available from the World Health Organization. The study, begun in 1998 and led by Dr. William U. Shipley, a radiation oncologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, had an ambitious goal: to follow the patients long enough to find out whether   treatment would affect their survival. Prostate cancer grows slowly, so it took well over a decade for answers to emerge. Researchers and patients from 150 sites in North America participated. The patients were 760 men who had their prostates removed for cancer that had not spread, but who then had a sign of recurrence  Ã¢ÂÂ   a rise in their blood levels of   antigen, or PSA, a protein associated with prostate cancer. The men in the study had PSAs of 0. 2 to 4 nanograms per milliliter. Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs just like the first wisp of smoke,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Zietman, who is a professor of radiation oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂll be fire someday. Ã¢ÂÂ The fire might take five, 10 or 15 years to break out, but Dr. Zietman said, Ã¢ÂÂMany are in their 50s or 60s, and will live long enough to get into trouble. Ã¢ÂÂ The traditional practice for a rising PSA after surgery has been to give radiation, which targets only the pelvis. The idea of the study was to add hormonal treatment, which might stop minute clumps of cancer that had spread to other parts of the body. All the men in the study had radiation for six and a half weeks. For two years, half also received a   drug, bicalutamide, and the other half were given placebos. They were followed, on average, for about 13 years. Ã¢ÂÂThis is the first trial thatÃ¢ÂÂs shown, if you follow these patients long enough, there is a real difference,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Zietman said. Ã¢ÂÂMore people survive 15 years later. Ã¢ÂÂ Men who had more aggressive cancers  Ã¢ÂÂ   reflected by higher PSA readings after surgery and by the pathology and surgical reports on their tumors  Ã¢ÂÂ   had the most to gain from the   treatment. The results do not mean that every man with a rising PSA after surgery should have hormone treatment, Dr. Zietman said. Men 75 or older may not need it, because they may die from other causes before the cancer can catch up with them. Ã¢ÂÂBut if theyÃ¢ÂÂre younger and with a longer life expectancy, treatment is reasonable,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Bicalutamide causes men to develop breasts and potentially other problems, and the high dose given in the study is no longer used in the United States. Other   drugs like Lupron have mostly taken its place, and may be even more effective, Dr. Zietman said. The study proved the concept that hormone blocking increases survival, he added, so other drugs that do the same thing should also help patients live longer. Another study in progress in Canada and Europe uses the newer drugs, and is trying to determine whether taking them for six months, rather than two years, might be enough.",cancer,Hormone Blockers Can Prolong Life if Prostate Cancer Recurs - The New York Times,2002.0,2002.0,2.0,
2003,"Cancers of the colon and rectum have been declining in older adults in recent decades and have always been considered rare in young people. But scientists are reporting a sharp rise in colorectal cancers in adults as young as their 20s and 30s, an ominous trend. The vast majority of colorectal cancers are still found in older people, with nearly 90 percent of all cases diagnosed in people over 50. But a new study from the American Cancer Society that analyzed cancer incidence by birth year found that colorectal cancer rates, which had dropped steadily for people born between 1890 and 1950, have been increasing for every generation born since 1950. Experts arenÃ¢ÂÂt sure why. Rectal cancers are rising particularly sharply, far faster than cancers in other parts of the large intestine or colon. The American Cancer Society estimates about 13, 500 new cases of colon and rectal cancers will be diagnosed in Americans under 50 this year, with more than 95, 500 cases of colon cancer and nearly 40, 000 cases of rectal cancer in all age groups. Ã¢ÂÂPeople born in 1990, like my son, have double the risk of colon cancer and quadruple the risk of rectal cancerÃ¢ÂÂ compared to the risk someone born in 1950 faced at a comparable age, said Rebecca Siegel, an epidemiologist with the American Cancer Society and the lead author of the new report, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute on Tuesday. And though the absolute risk is still small in younger people, she said, Ã¢ÂÂThey carry the risk forward with them as they age. Ã¢ÂÂ It is the upward trend that is worrisome: The risk of colon cancer for individuals who were born in 1990 was five per million people in that birth group, up from three per million at the same stage of life for those born in 1950. And the risk of rectal cancer for those born in 1990 was four per million, up from 0. 9 per million for those born in 1950. Dr. Thomas Weber, a professor of surgery at SUNY Downstate Medical Center who has served on the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable and who was not involved in the new study, said the latest research confirms the problem is real and increasing. Ã¢ÂÂThere is no mistaking these dramatic increases, especially for rectal cancers,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, noting that the number of new colorectal cancers among people under 50 each year exceeds the total number of new cases of less common cancers like HodgkinÃ¢ÂÂs lymphoma. Young people with colorectal cancer run the added risk of getting a diagnosis later in the course of their disease, when the cancer may be less treatable, because doctors typically donÃ¢ÂÂt consider the diagnosis at such a young age. Kirsten Freiborg, who is now 27, complained to doctors repeatedly about having blood in her stool when she was in college, but was told she had internal hemorrhoids. She was finally given a diagnosis of advanced colon cancer a month before her graduation, when she was 22. Ms. FreiborgÃ¢ÂÂs mother, a registered nurse, Ã¢ÂÂkept pushingÃ¢ÂÂ for more testing, Ms. Freiborg said, and eventually convinced physicians to send her for a procedure called a flexible sigmoidoscopy, which detected a large tumor in Ms. FreiborgÃ¢ÂÂs colon. Ã¢ÂÂI still remember getting the phone call from the doctor who did the procedure, who was completely shocked, and said Ã¢ÂÂI would never have guessed that a    would have had cancer,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ said Ms. Freiborg, who was treated with surgery and chemotherapy and is now  . Most colorectal cancers are considered a disease of aging, so any increase in young adults, especially when rates of the disease are on the wane in older people, is both baffling and worrisome, experts say. Colorectal cancer rates have declined over all in recent years thanks to widespread use of screening tests like colonoscopies, which can detect precancerous polyps that can be removed before cancer develops. These screening tests have not been considered practical for a younger population, and while other less invasive screening tests exist, doctors are hoping improved methods that will be easier to administer will be developed. Experts also attribute lowering cancer rates to changes in risk factors, particularly lifestyle changes like smoking cessation and healthier diets. Diets that include more fruits, vegetables and fiber and less red and processed meat are linked to lower colorectal cancer risk. Obesity and sedentary lifestyles are also associated with colorectal cancer, as are heavy alcohol use and chronic conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and Type 2 diabetes, all of which are on the rise. But experts are not entirely convinced these are the only reasons colorectal cancer is increasing among young people. While rates of cancers tied to human papillomavirus, or HPV, have been rising in recent years, that virus causes mainly cancers of the cervix, anus or the back of the throat, and only a small number of cases of rectal cancer. Ã¢ÂÂThe honest truth is nobody knows 100 percent why there is an increase,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Mohamed E. Salem, an assistant professor at Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center at Georgetown University. He said that he is older than about 60 percent of his patients  Ã¢ÂÂ   and he is 42. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs hard to blame it on obesity alone. We suspect there is also something else going on. Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Jason A. Zell, an associate professor of oncology at the University of California, Irvine, who did a study in 2014 that found increasing rates of colorectal cancer among adults ages 20 to 39 in California, said the big challenge is how to shape health policy. Ã¢ÂÂBy now we know the rates are going up, itÃ¢ÂÂs been reported several times,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Zell said. Ã¢ÂÂNow the question is, what do we do?Ã¢ÂÂ The latest analysis is the largest and most detailed to date, looking at large cancer registries reporting on nearly half a million cases dating back to 1974 to assess rates by   age groups and birth cohorts. It found that in adults ages 20 to 39, colon cancer rates have increased by 1 percent to 2. 4 percent a year since the   while rates declined over all among those 55 and older. Rates among adults 40 to 54 increased by 0. 5 percent to 1. 3 percent a year since the  . Rectal cancer incidence rates among adults in their 20s increased even more sharply, rising by 3. 2 percent a year from 1974 to 2013. And while rectal cancer rates have declined over all among people 55 and older since 1974, rates in people 50 to 54 increased between   and  . By   nearly 30 percent of all rectal cancers were being diagnosed in people under age 55, compared with 15 percent of all rectal cancers being found in this age group in   the study reported. Many patients are so young at the time of diagnosis that they have not been screened by colonoscopy, which is recommended beginning at age 50 for people who are at average risk. The risk is higher among   and the American College of Gastroenterology recommends they start screening at 45. Those with colorectal cancer may experience warning signs, but the symptoms are typically vague, including general digestive complaints like diarrhea or constipation, cramping and abdominal pain. Tara Anderson, a    mother of four from Bowie, Md. had chronic constipation for years before seeking help at a   emergency room clinic in 2015 because she was in so much pain. There, a scan detected a tumor in her colon Ã¢ÂÂthe size of a tennis ball,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. A gastroenterologist who examined her a year earlier merely told her to increase her intake of dietary fiber to ease her constipation, she said. Fortunately, she said, her disease had not spread. For Chris Roberts, who was 29 when he found out he had colon cancer, the first symptoms were weight loss and loss of appetite. Ã¢ÂÂI lost about 20 pounds and I wasnÃ¢ÂÂt really trying to lose weight, but I just didnÃ¢ÂÂt enjoy eating,Ã¢ÂÂ said Mr. Roberts, now 30. He had just moved to New York City and did not have a regular doctor, but was fortunate enough to find a doctor who was determined to make a diagnosis quickly and ordered several blood tests and an ultrasound scan that found tumors that had already spread to Mr. RobertsÃ¢ÂÂs liver. He has been treated with chemotherapy and had surgery in January to remove parts of his colon and liver. Ã¢ÂÂI definitely want to get the word out: If you have symptoms that may be linked to cancer, colorectal cancer or any kind, get it checked out,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.",cancer,Colon and Rectal Cancers Rising in Young People - The New York Times,2003.0,2003.0,3.0,
2004,"After learning he had early stage prostate cancer, Paul Kolnik knew he wanted that cancer destroyed immediately and with as little disruption as possible to his busy life as the New York City BalletÃ¢ÂÂs photographer. So Mr. Kolnik, 65, chose a type of radiation treatment that is raising some eyebrows in the prostate cancer field. It is more intense than standard radiation and takes much less time  Ã¢ÂÂ   five sessions over two weeks instead of 40 sessions over about two months or 28 sessions over five to six weeks. The newer therapy is surging in popularity, but no one knows whether it is as effective in curing prostate cancer, or how its side effects compare. The rise of   radiation is an example of the evidentiary blind spots that bedevil the treatment of prostate cancer. It is second only to lung cancer in men, striking 180, 000 patients a year. But treatments for lung cancer, and for other common cancers like those of the breast and colon, have been evaluated in randomized clinical trials more often than those for prostate cancer. The number of men getting the short, intense treatment, called stereotactic body radiation therapy, or S. B. R. T. more than doubled to 1, 886 in 2013 from 716 in 2007, according to the most recent Medicare data. The number of men getting standard radiation therapy fell over that same time period, according to Medicare, to 47, 512 from 66, 549. The National Cancer Institute has just agreed to fund a clinical trial that researchers hope will settle which treatment is better. It will randomly assign 538 men to have either a short course of five intense radiation sessions over two weeks or 28 treatments over five and a half weeks, comparing outcomes for quality of life as well as   survival. But it will be at least eight years before the answers are in. In the meantime, men and their doctors are left with uncertainty. Ã¢ÂÂIdeally, we want to show five treatments is better,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Rodney J. Ellis, a radiation oncologist at Case Comprehensive Cancer Center in Cleveland and the principal investigator for the trial. One reason for the dearth of data is that prostate cancer usually grows slowly, if at all, so it can take many years to see if a treatment saved lives. It is expensive and difficult to follow patients for such a long time, and the treatments given to the men often change over a decade, making doctors wonder if the results are relevant. Also, researchers who have tried to conduct studies comparing treatments often failed because specialists were already convinced that the method they used was best and were reluctant to assign men to other treatments. Dr. Ian Thompson of the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, said he was involved with several clinical trials that withered for that reason. When clinical trials succeed, though, they can provide important information. For example, a recent one showed that   drugs can prolong life for men whose prostate cancer recurs after surgery to remove the prostate. The researchers on the new study think recruitment will not be a major problem because they are comparing different courses of radiation, rather than entirely different approaches  Ã¢ÂÂ   for example, surgical removal of the prostate versus implantation of radioactive seeds in the prostate. A study to investigate those two approaches closed because investigators were able to enroll only 20 patients, Dr. Thompson said. For men, quality of life is often pivotal in choosing a treatment, weighing which possible side effects sound worse: with surgery, urinary incontinence and impotence or, with radiation, bowel problems including diarrhea and rectal leakage, and impotence. With the shorter radiation treatment, there is also a possibility that scarring can block the urethra, an effect that might not emerge until years after the treatment. In the absence of a broad base of solid evidence, men often make decisions based on personal preferences or on the advice of a trusted doctor. Like Mr. Kolnik, some want as short a recuperation as possible and find the newer kind of radiation treatment appealing. But prostate cancer specialists worry about the lack of data. Dr. James Yu, a radiation oncologist at Yale, who will lead the quality of life assessment for the new clinical trial, says crucial unanswered questions are, Ã¢ÂÂHow fast can you give it and how fast is too fast?Ã¢ÂÂ Very high dose radiation was studied in the treatment of lung cancer, said Dr. Anthony V. DÃ¢ÂÂAmico, a radiation oncologist at Brigham and WomenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. For lung cancer patients with small tumors that are not near sensitive structures, like large blood vessels, it appears to be just as curative as surgery. But lung cancer is easier to treat because, with properly selected patients, doctors can avoid sensitive tissues  Ã¢ÂÂ   all the oncologist has to worry about is hitting the cancer. Not so with prostate cancer. Ã¢ÂÂThe urethra is within the prostate and the bladder neck is literally touching to top of the prostate,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. DÃ¢ÂÂAmico said. Also, the rectum is directly behind the prostate. Radiation can damage those other tissues, he said. Injuries to the urethra and bladder neck might not show up until five or 10 years after the treatment, Dr. DÃ¢ÂÂAmico noted. Those structures can scar and close, limiting the flow of urine. It also can take years before rectal scarring produces symptoms like bleeding. A few years ago, Dr. Yu and his colleagues looked at Medicare data and reported that men who had more intense radiation therapy were more likely to have urinary problems after two years than those who had the   therapy. Dr. Yu noted that his study was not a randomized trial, the gold standard, but he said the results were not reassuring. Now, though, he is not so sure the intense therapy is worse. Ã¢ÂÂIn my own experience, these men have done really well,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂThat tells us that techniques improved, or the medical claims we evaluated were not indicative of major toxicity, or the way we and others at   centers deliver radiotherapy is different. Ã¢ÂÂ The lack of solid data bothers Dr. Daniel W. Lin, chief of urologic oncology at the University of Washington. When men ask him about the shorter radiation course, he tells them, Ã¢ÂÂIt probably can work but it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have   results and it hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been tested against standard radiation. Ã¢ÂÂ At centers like Sloan Kettering, doctors are relying on their own experience. Dr. Michael J. Zelefsky, a radiation oncologist who treated Mr. Kolnik there, said that several years ago, 90 percent of his patients had the standard course of treatment. Now 90 percent choose the shorter course. On the basis of Sloan KetteringÃ¢ÂÂs experience with several hundred men who had the intense radiation therapy over the past three years, the treatment, he said, Ã¢ÂÂis emerging as a very exciting form of therapy. Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Kolnik is more than satisfied. During his treatment, he said, Ã¢ÂÂI totally kept up with my schedule. Ã¢ÂÂ He did not even tell anyone other than a few close friends that he was having radiation therapy. Ã¢ÂÂThe treatment begins and it finishes before you even realize it,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Kolnik said.",cancer,"Popular Prostate Cancer Therapy Is Short, Intense and Unproven - The New York Times",2004.0,2004.0,4.0,
2005,"A rare cancer first linked to breast implants in 2011 has now been associated with nine deaths, the Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday. As of Feb. 1, the agency had received a total of 359 reports of the cancer associated with the implants. The deaths were not caused by breast cancer, the agency said, but by a rare malignancy in the immune system, anaplastic   lymphoma. In cases linked to implants, this rare form of cancer grows in the breast, usually in the capsule of scar tissue that forms around an implant. It is usually treatable and not often fatal. The problem is more likely to occur with textured implants, which have a pebbly surface, than with smooth implants, the agency said. Of the 359 reported cases, 231 included information about the implant surface: 203 were textured, and 28 smooth. The contents of the implants appeared much less important: Of 312 cases where the contents were known, 186 were filled with silicone gel, and 126 with saline. Cases generally come to light when symptoms develop, like lumps, pain, fluid buildup and swelling. The agency said it was impossible to say how many cases exist, because of limited reporting of problems and a lack of worldwide sales data on implants. About 290, 000 women in the United States had implants for breast enlargement in 2016, and 109, 000 received them for reconstruction after breast cancer, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. In many cases when the lymphoma occurs, just removing the implant and the tissue around it eliminates the disease. But some women may need chemotherapy and radiation. Why there is a difference in risk related to the surfaces is not known, but the bodyÃ¢ÂÂs reaction to textured implants is different from its reaction to smooth ones, according to Dr. Alex K. Wong, a plastic surgeon and researcher at the University of Southern CaliforniaÃ¢ÂÂs Keck School of Medicine. Tissue grows into microscopic grooves in the textured implants. Ã¢ÂÂWhen we take these out, you can hear a peeling sound,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Wong said. Ã¢ÂÂWhereas with a smooth implant, itÃ¢ÂÂs like  . You can spin it around. It moves really easily. Ã¢ÂÂ Studies in rats in his laboratory show different levels of genetic activity in the animalsÃ¢ÂÂ tissues in response to smooth versus textured implants. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre still trying to find out why the surface matters,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, adding that in some cases the cancer seems also to be associated with a certain bacterial infection. Surgeons use textured implants if they want the implant to stick in place and not move, which is important for newer, anatomically shaped implants that would look bad if they were to shift or turn upside down. The F. D. A. says doctors should consider the possibility of lymphoma in women who start having breast problems a long time after implant surgery. If a woman with implants has no problems, there is no reason to remove them, the F. D. A. says, emphasizing that the lymphoma seems to be very rare. But women receiving implants should be aware of the potential problem and the increased risk with textured implants, the agency says. A spokeswoman for the F. D. A. Stephanie Caccomo, said TuesdayÃ¢ÂÂs announcement was made because Ã¢ÂÂin 2016, there were several advances in the description of the disease and treatment recommendations, including recognition of the disease by the World Health Organization and publication of diagnosis and treatment guidelines by the Plastic Surgery Foundation and National Comprehensive Cancer Network.

2006,"CHICAGO  Ã¢ÂÂ   A blood test to detect cancer mutations produced results that generally agree with those of an invasive tumor biopsy, researchers reported, heralding a time when diagnosing cancer and monitoring its progression may become less painful and risky. The blood tests, known as liquid biopsies, represent one of the hottest trends in oncology. They take advantage of the fact that DNA fragments from tumors can be found in tiny amounts in the blood of patients with cancer. Researchers hope that such tests can become alternatives to conventional tumor biopsies, in which a piece of the tumor is extracted by needle or by surgery  Ã¢ÂÂ   procedures that can have complications. The results of the study, the largest to date of a liquid biopsy test, give some reassurance that this might be possible. Ã¢ÂÂI think this study really demonstrates the veracity of the liquid biopsy approach,Ã¢ÂÂ said Philip C. Mack, director of molecular pharmacology at the University of California Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center, who is presenting the results here this weekend to the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. The liquid biopsies are not currently used to diagnose cancer but rather to monitor disease progression or to detect genetic mutations in the tumor that could suggest which drug should be used to treat the disease. Just this week the Food and Drug Administration gave its first approval for such a test, one developed by Roche to detect mutations in a particular gene. Lung cancers with mutations in that gene are vulnerable to treatment with certain drugs, including RocheÃ¢ÂÂs own Tarceva. Many liquid biopsy tests are being sold by other companies under rules that do not require F. D. A. approval. The study looked at the results of more than 15, 000 liquid biopsies performed by Guardant Health, a Silicon Valley   that is one of the leaders in the field. While many liquid biopsy tests now look for only a few mutations, GuardantÃ¢ÂÂs test, which has a list price of $5, 800, looks at mutations in 70   genes. The 15, 000 samples came from the blood of people with various types of cancer, including lung, breast and colorectal. The researchers on the study, most of whom worked for Guardant, said the frequency and types of mutations found were similar to what is known from scientific literature. For nearly 400 patients, tumor biopsies were available, allowing for direct comparison to the blood test results from the same patient. For certain mutations that drive tumor growth, if a particular mutation was found in the blood it was also found in the tumor 94 to 100 percent of the time. There was much less agreement for mutations that predict resistance to particular drugs. Those might have arisen only after treatment started, so might not have been seen in the tumor biopsy, which is usually taken at the time of diagnosis. One shortcoming of the liquid biopsy was that for about 15 percent of the patients over all, no tumor DNA was detected in the blood. Ã¢ÂÂThere are simply tumors that do not shed DNA into circulation at detectable levels, so we are bound to miss them,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Mack, who has been a paid speaker for Guardant. Dr. Edward Kim, an expert on lung cancer mutations who was not involved in the study, said the results showed the liquid biopsy accuracy was Ã¢ÂÂvery good. Ã¢ÂÂ He said, however, that use of an actual tumor sample allows for a more thorough analysis, including more mutations than is possible with a blood sample. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm not personally ready to give up tissue,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Kim, who is chairman of solid tumor oncology at the Carolinas HealthCare SystemÃ¢ÂÂs Levine Cancer Institute in Charlotte, N. C. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs still the gold standard. Ã¢ÂÂ Still, he said, there are times when a tissue biopsy cannot be obtained, and it is difficult to do second and third tissue biopsies on a patient. In those cases, he said, Ã¢ÂÂI love the option of having the blood test available. Ã¢ÂÂ Dozens of companies are now developing or offering liquid biopsies, and tissue biopsy companies are trying to defend their turf. Foundation Medicine, which analyzes tissue biopsies for mutations, sued Guardant last month, accusing it of patent infringement, which Guardant denies. Meanwhile, Foundation has introduced its own liquid biopsy test. The next frontier could be to develop a blood test to detect many or virtually all types of cancer at an early stage, when they might be most easily treatable. That might be tricky because patients could be given needless treatments and needless anxiety in the case of false positives, or if the test detected cancers that were real but would not hurt the patient if left alone. Illumina, a manufacturer of DNA sequencing machines, formed a company in January to develop such a test. It named the company Grail. Not to be outdone in the hyperbolic naming department, Guardant last month began studies to validate its own   test, using the name Project Lunar.",cancer,Ã¢ÂÂLiquidÃ¢ÂÂ Cancer Test Offers Hope for Alternative to Painful Biopsies - The New York Times,2006.0,2006.0,6.0,
2007,"Microsoft scientists have demonstrated that by analyzing large samples of search engine queries they may in some cases be able to identify internet users who are suffering from pancreatic cancer, even before they have received a diagnosis of the disease. The scientists said they hoped their work could lead to early detection of cancer. Their study was published on Tuesday in The Journal of Oncology Practice by Dr. Eric Horvitz and Dr. Ryen White, the Microsoft researchers, and John Paparrizos, a Columbia University graduate student. Ã¢ÂÂWe asked ourselves, Ã¢ÂÂIf we heard the whispers of people online, would it provide strong evidence or a clue that somethingÃ¢ÂÂs going on? Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Dr. Horvitz said. The researchers focused on searches conducted on Bing, MicrosoftÃ¢ÂÂs search engine, that indicated someone had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. From there, they worked backward, looking for earlier queries that could have shown that the Bing user was experiencing symptoms before the diagnosis. Those early searches, they believe, can be warning flags. While   survival rates for pancreatic cancer are extremely low, early detection of the disease can prolong life in a very small percentage of cases. The study suggests that early screening can increase the   survival rate of pancreatic patients to 5 to 7 percent, from just 3 percent. The researchers reported that they could identify from 5 to 15 percent of pancreatic cases with false positive rates of as low as one in 100, 000. The researchers noted that false positives could lead to raised medical costs or create significant anxiety for people who later found out they were not sick. The data used by the researchers was anonymized, meaning it did not carry identifying markers like a user name, so the individuals conducting the searches could not be contacted. A logical next step would be to figure out what to do with that search information. One possibility would be some sort of health service where users could allow their searches to be collected, allowing scientists to monitor for questions that indicate warning flag symptoms. Ã¢ÂÂThe question, Ã¢ÂÂWhat might we do? Might there be a Cortana for health some day? Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ said Dr. Horvitz, in a reference to the companyÃ¢ÂÂs   online personal assistant software service. Although the researchers declined to offer specific details, Dr. White is now the chief technology officer of health intelligence in a recently created Health  Wellness division at Microsoft. They acknowledged that   data generated from web search histories was still new territory for the medical profession. Ã¢ÂÂI think the mainstream medical literature has been resistant to these kinds of studies and this kind of data,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Horvitz said. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre hoping that this stimulates quite a bit of interesting conversation. Ã¢ÂÂ The new research is based on the ability of the Microsoft team to accurately distinguish between web searches that are casual or based on anxiety and those that are genuine searches for specific medical symptoms by people who are experiencing them, he noted. Both a computer scientist and a medical doctor by training, Dr. Horvitz said he had been exploring this area in part because of a phone conversation with a close friend who had described symptoms. Based on their conversation, Dr. Horvitz advised him to contact his doctor. He received a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and died several months later. The availability of vast sets of behavior data based on individual web queries using the search engines offered by companies like Google and Microsoft has for a number of years been seen as a potential indicator of   information. In 2009, Google published a research paper that explored the potential of early detection of flu epidemics based on statistical analysis of web search logs, though the results of that effort ultimately fell short of what had been hoped. More recently, Microsoft researchers have had significant success in finding early evidence of adverse drug reactions from patterns observed in web logs. In 2013, they detected unreported side effects of prescription drugs before they were found by the Food and Drug AdministrationÃ¢ÂÂs warning system. The researchers are exploring evidence related to a range of devastating diseases. They also said that unlike the drug interaction data, which would be of direct value to the F. D. A. as an early alert, it was possible that symptom alert data might be made available as part of a broader online health service that a company like Microsoft might offer.",cancer,Microsoft Finds Cancer Clues in Search Queries - The New York Times,2007.0,2007.0,7.0,
2008,"Americans seem very afraid of cancer, with good reason. Unlike other things that kill us, it often seems to come out of nowhere. But evidence has increasingly accumulated that cancer may be preventable, too. Unfortunately, this has inflamed as much as it has assuaged peopleÃ¢ÂÂs fears. As a physician, I have encountered many people who believe that heart disease, which is the single biggest cause of death among Americans, is largely controllable. After all, if people ate better, were physically active and stopped smoking, then lots of them would get better. This ignores the fact that people canÃ¢ÂÂt change many risk factors of heart disease like age, race and family genetics. People donÃ¢ÂÂt often seem to feel the same way about cancer. They think itÃ¢ÂÂs out of their control. A study published in Science in January 2015 seemed to support that view. It tried to explain why some tissues lead to cancer more often than others. It found a strong correlation between the number of times a cell divides in the course of a lifetime and the risk of developing cancer. In other words, this study argued that the more times DNA replicates, the more often something can go wrong. Some took this to mean that cancer is much more because of Ã¢ÂÂbad luckÃ¢ÂÂ than because of other factors that people could control. Unfortunately, this simple explanation is not really what the study showed. Lung cells, for instance, divide quite rarely, and still account for a significant amount of cancer. Cells in the gastrointestinal tract divide all the time and account for many fewer cancers. Some cancers, like melanoma, were found to be in the group of cancers influenced more by intrinsic factors (or those we canÃ¢ÂÂt control) when we clearly know that extrinsic factors, like sun exposure, are a major cause. Further, this study was focused more on the relative risks of cancer in one type of tissue versus another. What we really care about is how much we can reduce our own risk of cancer by changing our behavior. A more recent study published in Nature argues that there is a lot we can do. Many studies have shown that environmental risk factors and exposures contribute greatly to many cancers. Diet is related to colorectal cancer. Alcohol and tobacco are related to esophageal cancer. HPV is related to cervical cancer, and hepatitis C is related to liver cancer. And youÃ¢ÂÂd have to be living under a rock not to know that smoking causes lung cancer and that too much sun can lead to skin cancer. Using sophisticated modeling techniques, the researchers argued that less than 30 percent of the lifetime risk of getting many common cancers was because of intrinsic risk factors, or the Ã¢ÂÂbad luck. Ã¢ÂÂ The rest were things you can change. Most recently, in JAMA Oncology, researchers sought to quantify how a healthful lifestyle might actually alter the risk of cancer. They identified four domains that are often noted to be related to disease prevention: smoking, drinking, obesity and exercise. They defined people who engaged in healthy levels of all of these activities as a Ã¢ÂÂlow riskÃ¢ÂÂ group. Then they compared their risk of getting cancer with people who werenÃ¢ÂÂt in this group. They included two groups of people who have been followed and studied a long time, the NursesÃ¢ÂÂ Health Study and the Health Professionals   Study, as well as national cancer statistics. Of the nearly 90, 000 women and more than 46, 000 men, 16, 531 women and 11, 731 men fell into the   group. For each type of cancer, researchers calculated a   risk, which is the percentage of people who develop cancer who might have avoided it had they adopted   behaviors. About 82 percent of women and 78 percent of men who got lung cancer might have prevented it through healthy behaviors. About 29 percent of women and 20 percent of men might have prevented colon and rectal cancer. About 30 percent of both might have prevented pancreatic cancer. Breast cancer was much less preventable: 4 percent. Over all, though, about 25 percent of cancer in women and 33 percent in men was potentially preventable. Close to half of all cancer deaths might be prevented as well. No study is perfect, and this is no exception. These cohorts are overwhelmingly white and consist of health professionals, who are not necessarily like the population at large. But the checks against the national data showed that if anything, these results might be underestimating how much cancer is preventable by healthy behaviors. This also isnÃ¢ÂÂt a randomized controlled trial, and we can certainly argue that it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt prove causation. A bigger concern to me is that people might interpret these findings as assigning fault to people who get cancer. You donÃ¢ÂÂt want to get into situations where you feel as if people donÃ¢ÂÂt deserve help because they didnÃ¢ÂÂt try hard enough to stay healthy. Much of cancer is still out of peopleÃ¢ÂÂs control. I was especially worried because, in this study, Ã¢ÂÂlow riskÃ¢ÂÂ status required all four healthy lifestyles. Failing in any one domain put you in the   category, and that seemed like a lot to ask of people. On further reading, though, I discovered that the requirements werenÃ¢ÂÂt overly burdensome. Not smoking was defined as never having smoked or having quit at least five years ago. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs clearly good for health. Moderate alcohol consumption was defined as no more than one drink a day on average for women, and no more than two for men. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs pretty much what I have argued for in writing about this issue in the past it in no way requires abstinence. Adequate weight was defined as a B. M. I. of at least 18. 5 and no more than 27. 5. The cutoff for Ã¢ÂÂoverweightÃ¢ÂÂ is 25, meaning that you donÃ¢ÂÂt have to be thin you just have to be less than obese (B. M. I. 30). Finally, exercise was defined as 150 minutes a week of   activity or 75 minutes of   activity. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a reasonable and quite achievable goal. I was surprised to realize that IÃ¢ÂÂm already Ã¢ÂÂlow risk. Ã¢ÂÂ I bet many people reading this are Ã¢ÂÂlow risk,Ã¢ÂÂ too. As we talk about cancer Ã¢ÂÂmoonshotsÃ¢ÂÂ that will most likely cost billions of dollars and might not achieve results, itÃ¢ÂÂs worth considering that  Ã¢ÂÂ   as in many cases  Ã¢ÂÂ   prevention is not only the cheapest course, but also the most effective. Simple changes to peopleÃ¢ÂÂs behaviors have the potential to make sure many cancers never occur. They have a side benefit of preventing health problems in many other areas, too. Investment in these efforts may not be as exciting, but it may yield greater results.",cancer,"Helpless to Prevent Cancer?

2009,"Bad news for men popped up in news media all over the country this week, based on a study from Northwestern University reporting that cases of advanced, aggressive prostate cancer had risen sharply from 2004 to 2013. Newsweek, NBC, CBS, Fox News and United Press International were among the organizations that covered the study. The reports suggested that recent medical advice against routine screening might be to blame for the apparent increase in advanced cases, by leading to delays in diagnosis until the cancer reached a late stage. Another factor cited was the possibility that prostate cancer had somehow become more aggressive. But the frightening news appears to be a false alarm  Ã¢ÂÂ   the product of a study questioned by other researchers but promoted with an incendiary news release and initially reported by some news media with little or no analysis from outside experts. The claim of an increase in advanced cases does not hold up, according to the American Cancer Society, which posted a statement on its website challenging the findings. The main concern is that the studyÃ¢ÂÂs methods do not pass muster with statistics experts, so the increase may not be real. In an interview, the cancer societyÃ¢ÂÂs chief medical officer, Dr. Otis W. Brawley, called the study Ã¢ÂÂmisguided epidemiologyÃ¢ÂÂ and said its authors Ã¢ÂÂdonÃ¢ÂÂt know that they donÃ¢ÂÂt know. Ã¢ÂÂ The episode began late last week when Northwestern University emailed an   news release to reporters. Ã¢ÂÂMetastatic Prostate Cancer Cases Skyrocket,Ã¢ÂÂ it said, and described a study  published Tuesday in the journal Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases. The studyÃ¢ÂÂs authors wrote that routine use of blood tests to screen for prostate cancer had declined, and that they wanted to find out if the decline had led to changes in the incidence of advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. Prostate screening has long been a subject of intense debate, with advocates insisting it saves lives and detractors saying it leads to too much unnecessary treatment of tumors that would never have progressed. The operation can leave men incontinent and impotent. In recent years, expert groups have advised against routine screening, saying the risks outweigh the benefits. But some doctors worry that the drop in screening will leave some men with disease that is found too late to be easily cured. The senior author of the study, Dr. Edward Schaeffer, a prostate cancer oncologist and the chairman of urology at Northwestern, said in an interview that he believed screening saved lives. In the study, the doctors examined the records of 767, 550 men with prostate cancer diagnosed from 2004 to 2013. Using the number of cases of metastatic disease in 2004 (1, 685) and 2013 (2, 890) they reported an alarming increase of 72 percent. But for the United States population, that percentage could be meaningless. On the cancer society website, Dr. Brawley said that to measure whether a disease was becoming more common, researchers could not rely on just the absolute number of cases. They need to calculate rates, meaning the number of cases per a certain number of people. Ã¢ÂÂEpidemiologists learned long ago that you canÃ¢ÂÂt simply look at raw numbers,Ã¢ÂÂ he wrote. Ã¢ÂÂA rising number of cases can be due simply to a growing and aging population among other factors. Ã¢ÂÂ Another expert expressed similar doubts. Dr. Christopher Filson, an assistant professor of urology at Emory University School of Medicine, said: Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt want to claim their results are wrong. They may be true, but the way they looked at the question brings in too many possible alternative explanations. Ã¢ÂÂ The authors acknowledged in their report that the lack of rates was a Ã¢ÂÂlimitation. Ã¢ÂÂ But they said that because the number of patients was large, their findings probably reflected national patterns. Dr. Schaeffer emphasized that the researchers did not claim a link between their findings and the advisories against screening they noted that advanced cases started rising even before those. Most of the initial news articles about the study reported the supposed increase without caveats, and few quoted the cancer society or outside experts. In some cases, online versions of the articles were amended to tone down the message and add comments from Dr. Brawley. Maggie Fox, a reporter for NBC, said she reported on the study because Ã¢ÂÂprostate cancer is a huge issue in this country, and the question of screening has been greatly controversial. Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Schaeffer, she said, is influential. Ã¢ÂÂWhat he says will make waves, and we felt it was important to report and include criticism of the study. Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Brawley said that even if further analysis found an increase in advanced cases, it would probably be from improvements in magnetic resonance imaging scanning. In other words, rather than reflecting more cases of advanced disease, the increase would mean doctors had become better at finding it.",cancer,Flawed Study of Advanced Prostate Cancer Spreads False Alarm - The New York Times,2009.0,2009.0,9.0,
2010,"DENVER  Ã¢ÂÂ   A cancer patient nicknamed the Steel Bull got his death sentence on a gloomy March Wednesday in 2015. He was 47, his given name Jason Greenstein, but he had earned the moniker from his oncologist for his stubborn will during more than four years of brutal chemotherapy and radiation treatment  Ã¢ÂÂ   all of which had failed. That Wednesday, March 4, his left side bulged with 15 pounds of tumor, doubling in size every few weeks. Lumps of HodgkinÃ¢ÂÂs lymphoma cells swelled in his lungs, making it hard to breathe, impinging a nerve and nearly paralyzing his left hand. Yet Mr. Greenstein, ever the optimist, was not prepared for his doctorÃ¢ÂÂs frank words when he displayed his latest symptom: tumors along his right jawline, the first spread of cancer to that side. The oncologist, Dr. Mark Brunvand, said he excused himself to the hallway to gather his emotions. When he returned a moment later, he looked Mr. Greenstein in the eye. Ã¢ÂÂYou are going to die,Ã¢ÂÂ he remembers saying. Ã¢ÂÂAnd because youÃ¢ÂÂre my friend, itÃ¢ÂÂs my job to make you as comfortable as possible. Ã¢ÂÂ Behind the doctor stood Mr. GreensteinÃ¢ÂÂs case manager, Poppy Beethe, crying. In a note to himself afterward, Dr. Brunvand described further treatment as Ã¢ÂÂmore toxic than beneficial,Ã¢ÂÂ and unwarranted Ã¢ÂÂunless he has dramatic response. Ã¢ÂÂ What happened next qualified as well beyond Ã¢ÂÂdramatic response. Ã¢ÂÂ A few days later, Mr. Greenstein agreed to try a   drug called nivolumab that was being tested for HodgkinÃ¢ÂÂs. It dripped into his veins, just like those   chemotherapy treatments. But this time, there were no harsh side effects. And this time, the outcome was very different. Three mornings later, Mr. Greenstein woke up to shock from his girlfriend. Ã¢ÂÂJason, youÃ¢ÂÂve got to see this!Ã¢ÂÂ she said. She looked at his back, where the cancer had so bulged that she affectionately called him Quasimodo. Ã¢ÂÂYour tumors have shrunk!Ã¢ÂÂ In an eye blink, after years of agonizing and futile treatment, Mr. GreensteinÃ¢ÂÂs cancer would disappear. Within weeks after that first treatment, his doctors declared him in remission. It was a result that put him at the vanguard of a new generation of cancer treatment called immunotherapy that casts into sharp relief the harshness of how we have long treated cancer and the less grueling way we might. ImmunotherapyÃ¢ÂÂs aim is to prompt the immune system, which is often stymied by cancer, to attack tumors with the zeal and sophistication that it attacks other diseases. The concept, at least in a primitive form, stretches back more than a century, but only in recent years have therapies been developed that show its true promise  Ã¢ÂÂ   and, for now, its limitations. In that astonishing span of six weeks, few of immunotherapyÃ¢ÂÂs successes seemed as dramatic as Mr. GreensteinÃ¢ÂÂs. Ã¢ÂÂHis story is not just one in a million,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Brunvand marveled, but Ã¢ÂÂone in 20 million. Ã¢ÂÂ On a personal level, this stunning medical reversal was not entirely surprising to Mr. GreensteinÃ¢ÂÂs family and friends. Jason and I were in a tight circle of high school buddies in Boulder, Colo. To us, he has always been a fierce competitor who attacked the world with passion, humor and unbridled optimism  Ã¢ÂÂ   along with, at times, inattention to detail and procrastination. Life was always an adventure, including JasonÃ¢ÂÂs death match against cancer, which he allowed me to chronicle. Then again, cancer is not easily beaten. And for all its promise, immunotherapy for now brings more disappointment than marvel for the majority of patients. The end of this story, sadly, allows no easy ebullience. Not for medicine. Not for Jason. When the symptoms hit in 2010, Jason was living in Las Vegas, where he had started a company called Green Man Group. It sold trinket boxes to casinos for use as gifts. Jason went to both law and business school and was obsessively entrepreneurial. He loved selling and schmoozing with customers on a    instead of    clock. Visiting casinos, he crisscrossed the country in an aging Chrysler Concorde, often with Skoal tobacco packed in his lip. He had come from tobacco users his dad had smoked cigars, his mom cigarettes since age 14. It was unseasonably warm on May 10 when Jason, driving back to Las Vegas from Arizona, felt his throat tickle and his head hurt. His legs had felt heavy for several months. Several days later, he attacked the symptoms with a homegrown remedy: He downed most of a   of Bud Light Chelada. Ã¢ÂÂIt didnÃ¢ÂÂt work out too well,Ã¢ÂÂ he said with a laugh, looking back. He felt worse in the morning. My first memories of Jason come from the dugout. We were teammates for years in Little League. I was a   player and Jason a perennial    Ã¢ÂÂ   center fielder and shortstop, leadoff hitter. He had the same gifts in football and basketball. Not just that  Ã¢ÂÂ   he was funny,   a good student and a good guy. His junior high nickname was Golden. But all was not golden for Jason. One morning in eighth grade, our friend Tom Meier found him in the locker room, sobbing. Jason had learned the day before that his dad, Joel, at 46, had been told he had colon cancer. Ã¢ÂÂHere was the strongest person I knew, and he was absolutely shattered,Ã¢ÂÂ Tom said. Over the years, JasonÃ¢ÂÂs friends and family would debate the extent to which his fatherÃ¢ÂÂs cancer and eventual death, in the summer before our senior year of high school, unmoored Jason. He had been JasonÃ¢ÂÂs first coach and chief advocate, attending every game, often chomping a stogie, stoic and  . In the weeks before he died, he watched Jason, a    point guard, help lead Boulder High School to a state basketball championship game. After his fatherÃ¢ÂÂs death, JasonÃ¢ÂÂs   grades tanked such that he had to explain them to Occidental College, where he was to play basketball and baseball. A manic side of Jason became more prominent. He never settled down with a family, and his businesses came and went. His inimitable passion remained, while his   sometimes faltered. Ã¢ÂÂDad was his guru I donÃ¢ÂÂt know how to describe it,Ã¢ÂÂ Guy Greenstein, JasonÃ¢ÂÂs older brother, and one of five siblings, told me. Ã¢ÂÂWhen my dad was gone, he was left to flounder a bit. Ã¢ÂÂ After Jason first felt sick, one doctor diagnosed mononucleosis, but two courses of antibiotics did not work. Each week, he felt more rundown, until one day in August, he could not get off the couch. Ã¢ÂÂIt reminded me of my dad,Ã¢ÂÂ Jason reflected. Ã¢ÂÂHe had never done that before, and then he started lying on the couch. Ã¢ÂÂ At summerÃ¢ÂÂs end, a family doctor told him he had HodgkinÃ¢ÂÂs. It was the best case of a   scenario  Ã¢ÂÂ   HodgkinÃ¢ÂÂs has a 95 percent cure rate. No problem, Jason thought, IÃ¢ÂÂll get it cured and move on. In 1990, Dr. Brunvand, was climbing Mount McKinley when he and his group got a distress call from 19, 600 feet. Seven Japanese climbers needed rescue in     winds. Dr. Brunvand, then huddled at 17, 000 feet, helped bring six of the climbers back alive. His tenacity made him a perfect match for Jason, and he knew what he would be putting Jason through. Dr. Brunvand, 60, a    veteran in his field, likens traditional chemotherapy to napalm. It kills not just cancer but other rapidly dividing cells, like the ones in the gut, hair follicles and mouth. Ã¢ÂÂWhen you have cancer, you spread napalm on it and burn everything to the ground. Ã¢ÂÂ Jason received his first treatment in September 2010 in Denver. A thin nurse with a kind smile hooked him to an IV. He tried to read, and felt like he did not belong with the line of sick people in chemo chairs. Into his veins dripped a   cocktail called A. B. V. D. that has been in wide use since the 1980s. After chemo, he described feeling Ã¢ÂÂthe sickest youÃ¢ÂÂve ever felt but multiplied by 10. Ã¢ÂÂ In spring 2011, after a brief remission, Jason became one of the unlucky few with HodgkinÃ¢ÂÂs his cancer recurred in his chest wall. He moved to the next level of treatment, Ã¢ÂÂsalvageÃ¢ÂÂ chemotherapy with the acronym ICE. Side effects: diarrhea, bruising, bleeding, hair loss, sore mouth. That winter, he got a round of   chemotherapy followed by a   transplant. Before the transplant, he met a psychologist at the Colorado Blood Cancer Institute, and, to prove his zest for life, Jason played air guitar and sang to her, wearing sunglasses. But when the psychologist, Andrea   went to see him in the hospital after his transplant, he was slumped in a hoodie. Ã¢ÂÂHe looked like this shadow sitting there. He looked up with his eyes, and not his chin, and said: Ã¢ÂÂThis is terrible,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ she recalled. This was what I, and others, began to see. Cancer had not beaten Jason yet treatment was starting to. When we talked by phone, he sometimes wept about his pain, exhaustion, pill regimen  Ã¢ÂÂ   15 medications or more daily, an alphabet soup of drugs, from acyclovir to fight infection to Zofran for nausea. Once, he showed up at the hospital after an   drive from Las Vegas with his red blood cell count so depleted (20 percent of normal) it could have killed him en route. He crawled to the elevator, where he was discovered, and then, while being wheeled away, joked with Dr. Brunvand that he had been in Las Vegas spending money on Ã¢ÂÂhookers and blow. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs hard not to love a guy who sees God with one eye and the seedy side with the other,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Brunvand said. In fall 2013, Jason was in remission again, finally, he said, feeling like himself. Then, the morning after his beloved Denver Broncos were crushed in the 2014 Super Bowl by the Seattle Seahawks, JasonÃ¢ÂÂs phone rang. It was Ms. Beethe, his case manager. Ã¢ÂÂJason, I have some bad news. Ã¢ÂÂ Another relapse, tests showed. Ã¢ÂÂI didnÃ¢ÂÂt know what was worse,Ã¢ÂÂ Jason grimly joked later, Ã¢ÂÂgetting cancer again, or the Broncos losing. Any true Bronco fan would say itÃ¢ÂÂs a tie. Ã¢ÂÂ Jason came up with an analogy to describe being a patient in a fight with cancer in his analogy, healthy people live in a village on a beautiful Tahitian island while cancer patients float around it in canoes. Ã¢ÂÂThe doctors pull on the rope and pull me back to the pier. I can still visit the people in the village. But IÃ¢ÂÂm drifting further and further,Ã¢ÂÂ Jason said. Ã¢ÂÂAll around me are coffins  Ã¢ÂÂ   the people who died from cancer. IÃ¢ÂÂm waiting for my canoe to turn into a coffin. Ã¢ÂÂ A few weeks after the Super Bowl, his friends planned a weekend for him in Boulder to, without putting so fine a point on it, say goodbye. Tom came from Minnesota and I from San Francisco. Jason, true to form, showed up to his own party two hours later than everyone else, having made a marathon drive from Las Vegas. At the end, we all said goodbye in the parking lot. I assumed IÃ¢ÂÂd never see Jason again. Jason battled for another year, until March 2015, when he received his death sentence and his family met with Dr. Brunvand to plan hospice care. Without much hope, they agreed to take a flier on a drug called nivolumab, part of the new frontier of immunotherapy. Nivolumab had been approved for advanced melanoma in 2014. An article published that year in The New England Journal of Medicine reported the drugÃ¢ÂÂs remarkable effect on relapsed HodgkinÃ¢ÂÂs patients, albeit in just 23 people. Dr. BrunvandÃ¢ÂÂs team managed to get a dose, though it was not yet on the market for HodgkinÃ¢ÂÂs, through a program called Ã¢ÂÂcompassionate use. Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Brunvand expected little. The evidence was scant, Jason so far gone. Ã¢ÂÂWhen I start to pray, I know itÃ¢ÂÂs time to let go,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Brunvand said. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂd started to pray for Jason. Ã¢ÂÂ Immunotherapy is based on the fact that once the immune system recognizes cancer and gears up to fight it, something remarkable happens: The immune system is rendered helpless. Scientists believe that the cancer sends signals to put the brakes on our   which are the ones that fight disease. A crucial way the tumor tricks   is by displaying on its surface a protein that is recognized by the   through a receptor called  . It stands for Ã¢ÂÂprogrammed death. Ã¢ÂÂ It tells the   to, in effect,  . This might seem like a serious design flaw. After all, why would immune cells commit suicide? It turns out that the PD system is essential to survival: It is   against the immune system attacking our own bodies (see: lupus, CrohnÃ¢ÂÂs disease, rheumatoid arthritis). Sometimes we want our bodies to halt the system cancer takes advantage of this survival mechanism. As Jason slogged through chemo, researchers around the country were experimenting with developing a     inhibitor for cancer so as to unleash the immune system. This concept was at the heart of the nivolumab treatment that Jason was about to receive. On March 13, JasonÃ¢ÂÂs girlfriend, Beth Schwartz, drove him to his first treatment. On the ride, he was not thinking about surviving, but about having his pain managed well enough to see his nephew Jack play that night in the state high school basketball tournament. Midafternoon, Jason sat in a recliner in the bleak, boxy room. A nurse in a blue gown cleaned his central line, an intravenous port in JasonÃ¢ÂÂs chest. She gave him steroids. Jason couldnÃ¢ÂÂt move his left arm or close his hand, the nerve so squeezed by HodgkinÃ¢ÂÂs. She hung a translucent bag from an IV pole. It held saline and 200 milligrams of nivolumab. The treatment lasted an hour. At least there were no side effects this was not scorched earth but   tinkering. Then Jason went to his nephewÃ¢ÂÂs game and sat with a former high school teammate, Dan Gallagher, who thought: Ã¢ÂÂHe looks so bad, I wonder if heÃ¢ÂÂll make it through the night. It was like looking at his dad again. Ã¢ÂÂ Three mornings later, when Beth exclaimed that JasonÃ¢ÂÂs tumor had shrunk, she wondered if she might be imagining things. So she decided to take pictures each day of his back. The evidence startles. On Day 1, his left half still looks like the Incredible Hulk, a veritable watermelon protruding. If you squint, you can see it shrinking by Day 3. Then, at two weeks, he looks slender, normal definition having returned. He had more nivolumab. Then he went for a   appointment. What happened to my cancer, he asked Dr. Brunvand, using an expletive. Ã¢ÂÂI watched the moon landing in 1969, and it was a similar sense of awe,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Brunvand said. Ã¢ÂÂIt was that same sense weÃ¢ÂÂd crossed a threshold,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, adding, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂd just seen the power of the immune system. Ã¢ÂÂ This is when I started taking notes. How could this be possible? Was this, indeed, a miracle? I spoke to Dr. John Timmerman, an oncologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was among the researchers on the paper in The New England Journal of Medicine. I told him JasonÃ¢ÂÂs story, and he said, Ã¢ÂÂWow. Ã¢ÂÂ But he also said, Ã¢ÂÂI have seen some pretty remarkable cases similar to this. Ã¢ÂÂ In 2013, Dr. Timmerman treated a    woman Ã¢ÂÂnear deathÃ¢ÂÂs door,Ã¢ÂÂ in such pain she could hardly move or sit down. She took the drug. The results: Ã¢ÂÂA miracle,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂThe next time she came in, two weeks later, she popped up on the exam table on her butt and my jaw dropped. Ã¢ÂÂ In almost the same breath, Dr. Timmerman offered a warning. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre in the honeymoon period,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, and for one crucial reason: Ã¢ÂÂPatients are responding. They are also relapsing. Ã¢ÂÂ Sometimes, tumors return in a few months or a year, sometimes not. Ã¢ÂÂI stay awake at night trying to get us beyond the honeymoon,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Timmerman said. Ã¢ÂÂHow do we leverage this into a cure?Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Brunvand, who had worked in his first AIDS clinic in 1986, hopes immunotherapy leads to fruitful,   lives for cancer sufferers just as antiretroviral drugs have for people with H. I. V. In summing up his hopes for immunotherapy in cancer, he says, simply, Ã¢ÂÂThink Magic Johnson. Ã¢ÂÂ If Dr. Brunvand is right, some future Jason might not only survive but also not be driven to the edge by the treatment itself. For now, though, life on medicineÃ¢ÂÂs cutting edge is no bowl of cherries, not with your survival at stake. Jason relapsed in August 2015. On Aug. 13, a resplendent Colorado day, Jason pulled up to my  Ã¢ÂÂ house in Denver, where I was visiting. He was a broken man. He moved slowly, hunched at his shoulders, wore   and looked to me like a character in Ã¢ÂÂDallas BuyerÃ¢ÂÂs Club. Ã¢ÂÂ We sat in the backyard. Jason sobbed. Ã¢ÂÂNo matter how many times they tell you youÃ¢ÂÂve got cancer, you donÃ¢ÂÂt get used to it,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. He mourned the toll it had taken on his family, especially on his mother, who supported him emotionally and financially. Ã¢ÂÂI think it would be easier for everyone if I was dead. Ã¢ÂÂ He asked for ice for his dry lips. But would you believe it? Jason wasnÃ¢ÂÂt done. He went in for radiation treatment, and soon appeared to have beaten the cancer back again. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs awesome. IÃ¢ÂÂm so psyched, dude,Ã¢ÂÂ he told me on Oct. 5. He was thinking of new business ventures, including working with a cancer doctor and researcher to develop an immunotherapy company. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm living proof!Ã¢ÂÂ In early April this year, I called him to check in. Jason did not pick up or call back. After several days, I called Dr. Brunvand. Ã¢ÂÂJasonÃ¢ÂÂs relapsed,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂTen days ago. Ã¢ÂÂ He had been shoveling snow at his motherÃ¢ÂÂs house when he felt his back go out. In excruciating pain, he went for an M. R. I. and other tests. They found evidence of HodgkinÃ¢ÂÂs in a vertebrae in the middle of his back and in the lining of his spinal column. Soon, his seventh vertebrae fully collapsed, an agonizing compression fracture, due in part to years of    therapies. Ã¢ÂÂThe treatment is killing him,Ã¢ÂÂ his mother, Catherine, told me when I arrived to visit on April 19. Jason sat in a recliner in the living room, in such agony he could hardly move. Heavy pain medications made him delirious. The next day, it took three nurses to gently lower him into a wheelchair outside the hospital, where he got a course of immunotherapy to treat HodgkinÃ¢ÂÂs in his spinal column. On May 17, the Food and Drug Administration approved nivolumab for patients with HodgkinÃ¢ÂÂs lymphoma in cases like JasonÃ¢ÂÂs, where the patient has relapsed or the cancer has progressed after a transplant. Jason got his last dose of the drug in late May. On June 1, he got the results of his latest scan. The tests showed no trace of cancer. But he was still in the hospital, virtually immobile, recuperating from surgery to stabilize his back with rods, and facing complications from coming off pain medications and steroids. On June 21, I woke to a text from Dr. Brunvand. Ã¢ÂÂJason has taken a dramatic turn for the worse. Ã¢ÂÂ Jason, who had been in the hospital for more than 70 days rehabilitating from the surgery, had suddenly stopped talking, his eyes closed most of the time, glassy and not home when open. Flummoxed, Dr. Brunvand could not find anything on brain or blood scans, ultimately deciding it was encephalopathy, meaning his brain had temporarily shut down to flush out toxins. Too many drugs for too many years. Specifically, Dr. Brunvand reasoned, the awakening of his immune system had led to inflammation in the nervous system. Jason was moved to intensive care, where he had a feeding tube, catheter, intubation. Dr. Brunvand ordered a spinal tap to give him steroids to combat the inflammation. But frankly, we all braced ourselves. Ã¢ÂÂI think heÃ¢ÂÂs lost the fight in him  Ã¢ÂÂ   and why wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt he?Ã¢ÂÂ his mom told me. I sent a text for his sister to read to him: Ã¢ÂÂRichtels send their love. Ã¢ÂÂ Over the next few days, Jason remained enveloped, struggling not to be pulled under by toxins, as he had been doing for years against cancer. On July 4, his girlfriend was sitting by his side in the intensive care unit when his eyes popped open. Ã¢ÂÂHeÃ¢ÂÂs awake!Ã¢ÂÂ she texted me. Happy Independence Day. He voraciously ate soup and applesauce. He watched the Colorado Rockies game. After a few days, the doctors told him his back was healing and they expected to send him home within weeks. On July 7, Jason texted a response to the note IÃ¢ÂÂd sent while he was in the I. C. U. Ã¢ÂÂThanks,Ã¢ÂÂ he wrote. Ã¢ÂÂBetter and trying for a comeback.

2011,"Steve Cara expected to sail through the routine medical tests required to increase his life insurance in October 2014. But the results were devastating. He had lung cancer, at age 53. It had begun to spread, and doctors told him it was inoperable. A few years ago, they would have suggested chemotherapy. Instead, his oncologist, Dr. Matthew D. Hellmann of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, recommended an experimental treatment: immunotherapy. Rather than attacking the cancer directly, as chemo does, immunotherapy tries to rally the patientÃ¢ÂÂs own immune system to fight the disease. Uncertain, Mr. Cara sought a second opinion. A doctor at another major hospital read his scans and pathology report, then asked what Dr. Hellmann had advised. When the doctor heard the answer, Mr. Cara recalled, Ã¢ÂÂhe closed up the folder, handed it back to me and said, Ã¢ÂÂRun back there as fast as you can. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Many others are racing down the same path. Harnessing the immune system to fight cancer, long a medical dream, is becoming a reality. Remarkable stories of tumors melting away and terminal illnesses going into remissions that last years  Ã¢ÂÂ   backed by solid data  Ã¢ÂÂ   have led to an explosion of interest and billions of dollars of investments in the rapidly growing field of immunotherapy. Pharmaceutical companies, philanthropists and the federal governmentÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂcancer moonshotÃ¢ÂÂ program are pouring money into developing treatments. Medical conferences on the topic are packed. All this has brought new optimism to cancer doctors  Ã¢ÂÂ   a sense that they have begun tapping into a force of nature, the medical equivalent of splitting the atom. Ã¢ÂÂThis is a fundamental change in the way that we think about cancer therapy,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Jedd Wolchok, chief of melanoma and immunotherapeutics services at Memorial Sloan Kettering. Hundreds of clinical trials involving immunotherapy, alone or combined with other treatments, are underway for nearly every type of cancer. Ã¢ÂÂPeople are asking, waiting, pleading to get into these trials,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Arlene   an oncologist at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who specializes in bladder cancer. The immune system  Ã¢ÂÂ   a network of cells, tissues and biochemicals that they secrete  Ã¢ÂÂ   defends the body against viruses, bacteria and other invaders. But cancer often finds ways to hide from the immune system or block its ability to fight. Immunotherapy tries to help the immune system recognize cancer as a threat, and attack it. Doctors tried a primitive version of immunotherapy against cancer more than 100 years ago. It sometimes worked remarkably well, but often did not, and they did not understand why. Eventually, radiation and chemotherapy eclipsed it. Researchers are now focused on two promising types of immunotherapy. One creates a new, individualized treatment for each patient by removing some of the personÃ¢ÂÂs immune cells, altering them genetically to kill cancer and then infusing them back into the bloodstream. This treatment has produced long remissions in a few hundred children and adults with deadly forms of leukemia or lymphoma for whom standard treatments had failed. The second approach, far more widely used and the one Mr. Cara tried, involves   drugs that do not have to be tailored to each patient. The drugs free immune cells to fight cancer by blocking a mechanism  Ã¢ÂÂ   called a checkpoint  Ã¢ÂÂ   that cancer uses to shut down the immune system. These drugs, called checkpoint inhibitors, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat advanced melanoma, HodgkinÃ¢ÂÂs lymphoma and cancers of the lung, kidney and bladder. More drugs in this class are in the pipeline. Patients are clamoring for checkpoint drugs, including one, Keytruda, known to many as Ã¢ÂÂthat Jimmy Carter drugÃ¢ÂÂ which, combined with surgery and radiation, has left the former president with no sign of recurrence even though melanoma had spread to his liver and brain. Checkpoint inhibitors have become an important option for people like Mr. Cara, with advanced lung cancer. Ã¢ÂÂWe can say in all honesty to patients, that while we canÃ¢ÂÂt tell them we can cure metastatic lung cancer right now, we can tell them thereÃ¢ÂÂs real hope that they can live for years, and for a lot of patients many years, which really is a complete Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. John V. Heymach, a lung cancer specialist and chairman of   and neck medical oncology at M. D. Anderson. Yet for all the promise and excitement, the fact is that so far, immunotherapy has worked in only a minority of patients, and researchers are struggling to find out why. They know they have their hands on an extraordinarily powerful tool, but they cannot fully understand or control it yet. Mr. Cara, an apparel industry executive from Bridgewater, N. J. had    lung cancer, the most common form of the disease. The diagnosis shattered what had been an idyllic life: a happy marriage, sons in college, a successful career, a beautiful home, regular vacations, plenty of golf. In December 2014, he began treatment with two checkpoint inhibitors. They cost about $150, 000 a year, but as a study subject he did not have to pay. These medicines work on killer   white blood cells that are often described as the soldiers of the immune system.   are so fierce that they have   brakes  Ã¢ÂÂ   the   checkpoints  Ã¢ÂÂ   to shut them down and keep them from attacking normal tissue, which could result in autoimmune disorders like CrohnÃ¢ÂÂs disease, lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. One checkpoint stops   from multiplying another weakens them and shortens their life span. As the name suggests, checkpoint inhibitors block the checkpoints, so cancer cannot use them to turn off the immune system. Mr. Cara took drugs to inhibit both types of checkpoints. Every two weeks, he had intravenous infusions of Yervoy and Opdivo, both made by   Squibb. He had no problems at first, just a bit of fatigue the day after the infusion. He rarely missed work. But turning the wrath of the immune system against cancer can be a risky endeavor: Sometimes the patientÃ¢ÂÂs own body gets caught in the crossfire. About two months into the treatment, Mr. Cara broke out in a rash all over his arms, back and chest. It became so severe that he had to go off the drugs. A steroid cream cleared it up and he was able to resume treatment  Ã¢ÂÂ   but with only one drug, Opdivo. Doctors stopped the other in hopes of minimizing the side effects. Checkpoint inhibitors can take months to begin working, and sometimes cause inflammation that, on scans early in treatment, can make it look like the tumor is growing. But Mr. CaraÃ¢ÂÂs first scans, in March 2015, were stunning. His tumor had shrunk by a third. By August, more than half of the tumor had vanished. The rash came back, however, and worsened. Steroids worked again, but in October a far more alarming side effect set in: breathing trouble. Doctors diagnosed pneumonitis, a lung inflammation caused by an attack from the immune system  Ã¢ÂÂ   a known risk of checkpoint drugs. Continuing the treatment posed too great a danger. Mr. Cara stopped the infusions, but the months of treatment seemed to have transformed his cancer to stage 2 from stage 4, meaning that it was now operable. This spring surgeons removed about a third of his right lung, and discovered that the cancer was actually gone. Ã¢ÂÂNo cancer was seen in any of the tissue they took out,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Hellmann said. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂOne hundred percent treatment effect,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ he read from the pathology report. Ã¢ÂÂIt was pretty cool. Ã¢ÂÂ Immunotherapy had apparently wiped out the disease. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs amazing. Unbelievable,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Cara said. As of now, he needs no further treatment, but he will be monitored regularly. He is back to work, and golf. Ã¢ÂÂHeÃ¢ÂÂs had the best possible response,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Hellmann said. Ã¢ÂÂI hope that remains permanent. Only time will tell, and I think heÃ¢ÂÂs conscious of that. Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Cara acknowledged, Ã¢ÂÂIs there something in the back of me that says this thing never goes away, it could come back any time? Sure. But itÃ¢ÂÂs not the main thing I think. IÃ¢ÂÂm young, IÃ¢ÂÂm strong, IÃ¢ÂÂm healthy, my pathology report came back clean. Ã¢ÂÂ He considered framing that pathology report. But, he said, Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt want to jinx myself. Ã¢ÂÂ When checkpoint inhibitors work, they can really work, producing long remissions that start to look like cures and that persist even after treatment stops. Twenty  percent to 40 percent of patients, sometimes more, have good responses. But for many patients, the drugs do not work at all. For others, they work for a while and then stop. The vexing question, and the focus of research, is, why? One theory is that additional checkpoints, not yet discovered, may play a role. The hunt is on to find them, and then make new drugs to act on them. Despite the gaps in knowledge, checkpoint inhibitors are coming into widespread use and are being tried in advanced types of cancer for which standard chemotherapy offers little hope. One example is anal cancer, a painful disease that carries a stigma because it is often linked to the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus or HPV, which also causes cervical cancer. Lee, 59, who asked that her last name be withheld to protect her privacy, found out in 2014 that she had the disease, and that it had spread to her liver. Ã¢ÂÂI was told IÃ¢ÂÂd be dead in 12 to 18 months with treatment, six months with no treatment,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Chemotherapy and radiation at a hospital near Dallas brought a remission that lasted only a few months. The cancer spread to her lungs. Bedridden and in severe pain, she entered an immunotherapy trial at M. D. Anderson. In May 2015 she began receiving Opdivo every two weeks. The tumors in her liver and lungs have shrunk by about 70 percent. She is back at work. While the drugs initially were given only to people with advanced disease, especially those who had little to lose because chemotherapy had stopped working, Dr. Heymach of M. D. Anderson predicted that soon some patients  Ã¢ÂÂ   including some with earlier stages of lung cancer  Ã¢ÂÂ   will receive checkpoint inhibitors as their first treatment. Immunotherapy is also enabling doctors to help patients in unexpected ways. Until recently, surgeons were reluctant to operate on people with advanced cancer because they knew from experience that it would not lengthen the patientÃ¢ÂÂs life. But checkpoint inhibitors are changing that. For instance, some patients have taken checkpoint inhibitors for an advanced cancer that had spread around the body, and wound up with only one stubborn tumor left. They then have had it surgically removed and have gone years without a relapse. Ã¢ÂÂTime has slowed down to the point where you can pay attention to individual tumors, since youÃ¢ÂÂre not running to put out the fire of wholesale systemic progression,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Wolchok said. If there is a potential downside to the advances, Dr. Hellmann said, it is that the buzz about immunotherapy has led some patients to think chemotherapy is passÃÂ©. Ã¢ÂÂImmunotherapy represents a hugely important new tool, but chemotherapy can work too and has been the backbone of the way weÃ¢ÂÂve treated patients with lung cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂImmunotherapy is not a replacement for that. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a new weapon. Ã¢ÂÂ One of his patients, a    man with lung cancer that had spread to his brain, was eager to try immunotherapy instead of chemotherapy. After having radiation treatment for one brain tumor, he began treatment with two checkpoint inhibitors. But they did not work. So his doctors switched to chemotherapy. Ã¢ÂÂHeÃ¢ÂÂs had a tremendous response,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Hellmann said. He said it was impossible to tell whether the immunotherapy could have had some delayed effect and worked synergistically with the chemotherapy. Clinical trials are now trying to resolve that question. But the potential for dangerous side effects cannot be overemphasized, doctors say. A 2010 article in a medical journal reported that a few melanoma patients had died from adverse effects of Yervoy. In addition to causing lung inflammation, checkpoint inhibitors can lead to rheumatoid arthritis and colitis, a severe inflammation of the intestine  Ã¢ÂÂ   the result of an attack by the   immune system that    remedies cannot treat. Patients need steroids like prednisone to quell these attacks. Fortunately  Ã¢ÂÂ   and mysteriously, Dr. Wolchok said  Ã¢ÂÂ   the steroids can halt the gut trouble without stopping the immune fight against the cancer. But if patients delay telling doctors about diarrhea, Dr. Wolchok warned, Ã¢ÂÂthey could dieÃ¢ÂÂ from colitis. Checkpoint inhibitors can also slow down vital glands  Ã¢ÂÂ   pituitary, adrenal or thyroid  Ã¢ÂÂ   creating a permanent need for hormone treatment. Mr. Cara, for instance, now needs thyroid medication, almost certainly as a result of his treatment. Doctors have reported that a patient with a kidney transplant rejected it after taking a checkpoint inhibitor to treat cancer, apparently because the drug spurred his immune system to attack the organ. Another of Dr. HellmannÃ¢ÂÂs   patients, Joanne Sabol, 65, had to quit a checkpoint inhibitor because of severe colitis. But she had taken it for about two years, and it shrank a large abdominal tumor by 78 percent. Patients like her are in uncharted territory, and doctors are trying to decide whether to operate to remove what is left of her tumor. Ã¢ÂÂI have aggressive cancer, but IÃ¢ÂÂm not giving in to it,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Sabol said. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs going to be a big battle with me. Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. William B. Coley, an American surgeon born in 1862, is widely considered the father of cancer immunotherapy. But he practiced a crude form of it, without understanding how it worked. Distressed by the painful death of a young woman he had treated for a sarcoma, a bone cancer, in 1891, Dr. Coley began to study the records of other sarcoma patients in New York, according to Dr. David. B. Levine, a medical historian and orthopedic surgeon. One case leapt out at him: a patient who had several unsuccessful operations to remove a huge sarcoma from his face, and wound up with a severe infection, then called erysipelas, caused by Streptococcal bacteria. The patient was not expected to survive, but he did  Ã¢ÂÂ   and the cancer disappeared. Dr. Coley found other cases in which cancer went away after erysipelas. Not much was known about the immune system, and he suspected, mistakenly, that the bacteria were somehow destroying the tumors. Researchers today think the infection set off an intense immune response that killed both the germs and the cancer. Dr. Coley was not alone in believing that bacteria could fight cancer. In a letter to a colleague in 1890, the Russian physician and playwright Anton Chekhov wrote of erysipelas: Ã¢ÂÂIt has long been noted that the growth of malignant tumors halts for a time when this disease is present. Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Coley began to inject terminally ill cancer patients with Streptococcal bacteria in the 1890s. His first patient, a drug addict with an advanced sarcoma, was expected to die within weeks, but the disease went into remission and he lived eight years. Dr. Coley treated other patients, with mixed results. Some tumors regressed, but sometimes the bacteria caused infections that went out of control. Dr. Coley developed an extract of   bacteria that came to be called ColeyÃ¢ÂÂs mixed toxins, and he treated hundreds of patients over several decades. Many became quite ill, with shaking chills and raging fevers. But some were cured.   and Company began producing ColeyÃ¢ÂÂs toxins in 1899, and continued for 30 years. Various hospitals in Europe and the United States, including the Mayo Clinic, used the toxins, but the results were not consistent. Early in the 20th century, radiation treatment came into use. Its results were more predictable, and the cancer establishment began turning away from ColeyÃ¢ÂÂs toxins. Dr. ColeyÃ¢ÂÂs own institution, Memorial Hospital (now Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) instituted a policy in 1915 stating that inpatients had to be given radiation, not the toxins. Some other hospitals continued using them, but interest gradually waned. Dr. Coley died in 1936. Chemotherapy, developed after World War II, was another blow to his methods. And in 1965, the American Cancer Society added ColeyÃ¢ÂÂs toxins to its list of Ã¢ÂÂunprovenÃ¢ÂÂ treatments. (The toxins were later taken off the list.) After Dr. ColeyÃ¢ÂÂs death, his daughter, Helen Coley Nauts, studied some 800 case records that he had left behind, and became convinced that he was onto something important. She tried to rekindle interest in his work, but she was thwarted by doctors who opposed it, including some with high rank at Sloan Kettering. However, in 1953 she founded the Cancer Research Institute in New York, a nonprofit that has become a significant supporter of research on the interplay between cancer and the immune system. The group awarded more than $29. 4 million in scientific grants in 2015, and its advisory board includes Dr. Wolchok and the scientist credited with developing the first checkpoint inhibitor, James P. Allison. Ã¢ÂÂAre you Dr. Allison?Ã¢ÂÂ James Allison and his wife, Dr. Padmanee Sharma, had just settled into their airplane seats when another passenger approached with tears in her eyes and thanked him for creating the drug that was keeping her husband alive. Dr. Sharma described the encounter during a joint interview with her and Dr. Allison in his office at M. D. Anderson in Houston, where both work. Ã¢ÂÂEvery time Jim meets a patient, he cries,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Sharma said. Ã¢ÂÂWell, not every time,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Allison said. Dr. Allison, 67, and Dr. Sharma, 45, have been research collaborators since 2005, and spouses since 2014, when he proposed by saying that nobody else could stand either of them  Ã¢ÂÂ   they talk about their work all the time  Ã¢ÂÂ   so they might as well get married. The drug the woman on the plane thanked him for was Yervoy, the first of the checkpoint inhibitors. It was approved for advanced melanoma in 2011. Dr. Allison  Ã¢ÂÂ   a scientist, not a physician  Ã¢ÂÂ   has won numerous research awards and is expected by many to win a Nobel Prize. He drives a Porsche convertible with a license plate bearing the name of the checkpoint he deciphered:  . A bearded, slightly rumpled figure, Dr. Allison plays harmonica with research colleagues in a   band called the Checkpoints. He is good enough to have accompanied Willie Nelson onstage at the Redneck Country Club in Stafford, Tex. this spring, playing, Ã¢ÂÂRoll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die. Ã¢ÂÂ Immunology, particularly the study of   has been his lifeÃ¢ÂÂs work. Cancer came later. Ã¢ÂÂI became interested in cancer because IÃ¢ÂÂve lost a number of family members to cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Allison, chairman of the immunology department and executive director of the immunotherapy platform at M. D. Anderson. Ã¢ÂÂMy mother and two of her brothers, and my own brother, died of cancer. Ã¢ÂÂ Around the time of his brotherÃ¢ÂÂs death from prostate cancer, Dr. Allison learned that he had the same disease himself. He was treated successfully, he said, adding with a laugh that he was more likely to die from inactivity than from cancer. In the 1990s, Dr. Allison, then at the University of California, Berkeley, and Dr. Jeffrey Bluestone of the University of California, San Francisco, independently made a landmark discovery: They proved that a molecule widely believed to activate the immune system actually shut it down. The molecule was a protein on the surface of    Ã¢ÂÂ   a crucial checkpoint  Ã¢ÂÂ   and it was natureÃ¢ÂÂs way of subduing the   apparently to dial back their ferocious activity and prevent them from attacking a personÃ¢ÂÂs own tissue. Cancer cells can sometimes lock onto checkpoints, disabling the  . Dr. Allison wondered if it might be possible to block the checkpoint and launch the   against cancer. He and a graduate student, Matthew Krummel, developed an antibody  Ã¢ÂÂ   a molecule made by certain cells of the immune system  Ã¢ÂÂ   that would stick to the checkpoint and block it. When the researchers, including Dana Leach, a postdoctoral fellow, gave the antibody to mice with cancer, tumors vanished. Recalling those first tests in mice, Dr. Allison said it was astounding to see the cancers shrink and disappear. Veterinarians thought the mice had contracted an infection or a skin disease. But the sores that worried the vets were actually tumors that were ulcerating and rotting away under assault by  . Many drug companies were skeptical about the findings, but one, Medarex, created a human version of the antibody. Medarex was later acquired by   Squibb, and the antibody, given the trade name Yervoy, was approved in 2011 to treat advanced melanoma. It became the first drug to prolong survival in people with this deadly form of cancer. Major studies that started before it was approved found that among 1, 861 patients treated for advanced disease, about 22 percent were still alive three years later, with no signs of recurrence  Ã¢ÂÂ   an astounding result for a disease that was almost always fatal. Some have survived 10 years or longer. The discoveries that led to the drug, Dr. Allison said, came entirely from years of basic research in immunology  Ã¢ÂÂ   experiments in test tubes and mice  Ã¢ÂÂ   and not from the clinical or Ã¢ÂÂtranslationalÃ¢ÂÂ science, aimed at moving rapidly into humans, that is so heavily favored now by institutions that pay for studies. Ã¢ÂÂNone of this came from cancer research, none,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Allison said, adding that without support for basic research, Ã¢ÂÂprogress, if any, will be incremental, not a big leap. Ã¢ÂÂ His own work is well funded, he said, but he worries about an overall trend to shortchange basic science. The focus of much of his and Dr. SharmaÃ¢ÂÂs research now is to understand how and why checkpoint inhibitors work in some patients and not others. Dr. Sharma, a professor of genitourinary medical oncology, is a physician and researcher who treats patients and oversees clinical trials, and she brings stories home to Dr. Allison about patients whose lives may be extended by his discoveries. In general, checkpoint inhibitors seem to work best for tumors with many mutations, like most melanomas and cancers of the lung and bladder. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs like buying a lottery ticket,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Sharma said. Ã¢ÂÂThe more genetic abnormalities, the more lottery tickets youÃ¢ÂÂve bought  Ã¢ÂÂ   and you have a much higher chance of a   recognizing something to start the immune response. Ã¢ÂÂ One area of particular interest is the tissue immediately in and around a tumor, what researchers call the microenvironment. By examining that zone, scientists can tell whether   are fighting the cancer. Sometimes   mob the margins of a tumor, but cannot get in. Other times, they get in but cannot kill it. Ã¢ÂÂHow do we understand what drives the immune response in one patient to give a good clinical outcome, and how do we then drive that same immune response in all the other patients?Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Sharma asked. Ã¢ÂÂDid the   get in? If not, is there another drug that can drive the   in?Ã¢ÂÂ Researchers also suspect that checkpoint inhibitors might work better if combined with treatments that kill tumor cells, because debris from dead cancer cells may help the immune system recognize its target. Studies are underway to test checkpoint drugs in combination with   treatments like chemotherapy and radiation. But it is a delicate balance to adjust the timing and doses, because in addition to killing cancer cells, those other treatments can knock out the immune system just when it is needed most. As word spreads about immunotherapy, a troubling fact remains: Patients do not have equal access to the new treatments, which can be prohibitively expensive. Insurers cover F. D. A.  treatments, but   can be high for costly drugs. Some people get costs covered by volunteering for clinical trials that are testing new drugs or novel combinations. But not everyone can, or wants to, enter a study. Participants tend to have the education, determination and means required to get second and third opinions, rearrange their lives, and buy plane tickets to get to   medical centers. And they are willing to take risks for a chance to survive. Minorities have been underrepresented in studies, for reasons that are not clear. David Wight, a retired oil engineer in Anchorage, is a study participant who has been able to take every possible step to save his life. When bladder cancer began to spread in his abdomen, he was given three to 12 months to live. That was four and a half years ago. On a recent Saturday, Mr. Wight, who is 75 but looks younger, refereed a boysÃ¢ÂÂ soccer game, racing up and down the field with the players. The following Wednesday he rose at 3 a. m. to fly 3, 300 miles to Houston, where he would arrive at about 5 p. m. He has been making that trip every other week for over two years to receive immunotherapy at M. D. Anderson. For about a year and a half, his disease has been in complete remission. Until recently, he paid his own airfare. But a few months ago,   Squibb, the maker of the drug being studied, began picking up the tab, even reimbursing him retroactively  Ã¢ÂÂ   about $50, 000 so far. He has five children: three in their 40s, a son, 16, and a daughter, 10. The younger two were only 10 and 5 when he learned he was ill, and the thought that he might not have survived to raise them still brings tears to his eyes. Describing the time he has gained to be with his family, he said, Ã¢ÂÂI won a lottery thatÃ¢ÂÂs bigger than anybody could imagine. Ã¢ÂÂ His cancer was diagnosed in summer 2010, after a test during a routine physical found cancer cells in his urine. A small tumor had invaded the wall of his bladder. Mr. Wight had his bladder removed at a hospital in Anchorage, and was told he needed no further treatment. A year after the surgery, he and his doctors were horrified to find that a large tumor had wrapped itself around his colon. Only then did the doctors discover that he had a rare, aggressive type of bladder cancer, called plasmacytoid. His doctors consulted with a hospital in Seattle, which devised a treatment plan. Ã¢ÂÂThey said one word that told me I was not where I wanted to be: Ã¢ÂÂpalliative,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Mr. Wight said. He knew palliative treatment was meant to ease symptoms, but not cure the disease. Ã¢ÂÂI said, Ã¢ÂÂNo thank you. We can do better than that,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ he recalled. His next stop was M. D. Anderson. Months of chemotherapy shrank the tumor enough to allow colon surgery in May 2012. But the disease kept coming back: spots in one lung, then the other, then a tumor under his kidney. Ã¢ÂÂI was getting a new tumor every six to eight months,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Chemotherapy and an experimental gene therapy cleared his lungs and shrank the tumor near his kidney but could not get rid of it. In June 2014, Mr. Wight became one of the first patients with bladder cancer at M. D. Anderson to enter a study of two checkpoint inhibitors. For three months he received Yervoy and Opdivo every two weeks, and then continued with only Opdivo. The tumor under his kidney shrank, then disappeared. It has been gone for a year and a half, and he has had no other signs of cancer. He is still receiving Opdivo  Ã¢ÂÂ   the reason for his regular trips to Houston. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm very fortunate,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Wight said. Ã¢ÂÂIt has for me a single irritating side effect. It makes me itch like you wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt believe. I itch all the time but itÃ¢ÂÂs a small price to pay to stay alive and be feeling pretty well. Ã¢ÂÂ An antihistamine helps. Regarding how long he will keep being treated, he said: Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs experimental. You donÃ¢ÂÂt know the answer. As long as I have positive results IÃ¢ÂÂm eligible for the treatment. Ã¢ÂÂ His oncologist, Dr.   called his response to immunotherapy Ã¢ÂÂfantasticÃ¢ÂÂ and said other patients, also in complete or partial remission, were flying or driving to Houston for treatments every two or three weeks. Many do not want to stop taking the drugs. But doctors do not know how long the treatments should continue. They wonder how long the remissions will last, and whether some will even turn out to be cures, Dr.   said. Some studies were planned to last just a year or two, longer than the life expectancy of most patients with advanced disease. Researchers did not think they would have to decide whether to keep treating people for years. Ã¢ÂÂWe were not expecting to see patients going this long,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr.   said.",cancer,Harnessing the Immune System to Fight Cancer - The New York Times,2011.0,2011.0,11.0,
2012,"BETHESDA, Md.  Ã¢ÂÂ   The young surgeon was mystified. A   tumor had been removed from the stomach of his patient 12 years earlier, but his doctors had not been able to cut out many smaller growths in his liver. The cancer should have killed him, yet here he lay on the table for a routine gallbladder operation. The surgeon, Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, examined the manÃ¢ÂÂs abdominal cavity, sifting his liver in his fingers, feeling for hard, dense tumors  Ã¢ÂÂ   but he could find no trace of cancer. It was 1968. Dr. Rosenberg had a hunch he had just witnessed an extraordinary case in which a patientÃ¢ÂÂs immune system had vanquished cancer. Hoping there was an elixir in the manÃ¢ÂÂs blood, Dr. Rosenberg got permission to transfuse some of it into a patient dying of stomach cancer. The effort failed. But it was the beginning of a lifelong quest. Ã¢ÂÂSomething began to burn in me,Ã¢ÂÂ he would write later, Ã¢ÂÂsomething that has never gone out. Ã¢ÂÂ Half a century later, Dr. Rosenberg, who turns 76 on Tuesday and is chief of surgery at the National Cancer Institute here, is part of a small fraternity of researchers who have doggedly pursued a dream  Ã¢ÂÂ   turbocharging the bodyÃ¢ÂÂs immune system so that more cancer patients can experience recoveries like his   patientÃ¢ÂÂs. Dr. Rosenberg, Dr. Carl H. June of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Michel Sadelain of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center have been at the forefront of this research for decades, laboring in separate labs in an intense     pursuit to bring to fruition a daring therapy that few colleagues believed would work. Now, versions of the therapy for a limited number of blood cancers are nearing approval by federal regulators, and could reach the market as early as next year. The technique, known as cell therapy, gives each patient an individualized and   version of their own immune system, one that Ã¢ÂÂworks better than nature made it,Ã¢ÂÂ as Dr. June puts it. The patientÃ¢ÂÂs   the soldiers of the immune system, are extracted from the patientÃ¢ÂÂs blood, then genetically engineered to recognize and destroy cancer. The redesigned cells are multiplied in the laboratory, and millions or billions of them are put back into the patientÃ¢ÂÂs bloodstream, set loose like a vast army of tumor assassins. This is an unusual pharmaceutical  Ã¢ÂÂ   a drug that is alive and can multiply once inside the body. Dr. June calls these cells Ã¢ÂÂserial killers. Ã¢ÂÂ A single one can destroy up to 100, 000 cancer cells. The killer cells are genetically engineered to produce a complex protein, an amalgam of pieces from different parts of the immune system that is unlike anything seen before. Ã¢ÂÂI call it a   molecule,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Renier J. Brentjens, the director of cellular therapeutics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. This radical,   therapy differs sharply from the more established type of immunotherapy, developed by other researchers. Those    drugs, known as checkpoint inhibitors, release a molecular brake on the immune system, freeing it to fight the cancer much as it fights infections by bacteria or viruses. Cell therapy, in contrast, is brewed specially for each patient, one of the many challenges the field faces in broadening its use. So far, the number of patients treated with cell therapy is in the hundreds, not thousands. And for now it works only for certain types of blood cancers, not common malignancies like breast and lung cancer. Researchers are also still working out how to control potentially lethal side effects. Just recently, a clinical trial was briefly halted after three patients died of brain swelling. Still, cell therapy has produced complete remissions in some patients who were out of treatment options, stirring excitement among doctors and patients and setting off a race among companies to bring the treatments to market. Getting to this point has taken decades of painstaking work, with many false starts and setbacks. Ã¢ÂÂIt was conceivable we were pursuing a ghost,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Rosenberg recalled. The son of Orthodox Jews who immigrated from Poland to New York and ran luncheonettes, Steven Rosenberg was about 6 years old when his family learned that many relatives, including six of his fatherÃ¢ÂÂs nine siblings, had been murdered in the Holocaust. Ã¢ÂÂI saw so much evil in the world that early on I decided I wanted to do something that would help people, not hurt people,Ã¢ÂÂ he said in an interview here. He received a medical degree from Johns Hopkins and a doctorate in biophysics from Harvard. From the start, he was a workaholic. At one point he tried to call off his relationship with Alice OÃ¢ÂÂConnell, whom he would later marry, because he was afraid it would distract him from research. Ã¢ÂÂI loved the night,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Rosenberg wrote in his book, Ã¢ÂÂThe Transformed Cell,Ã¢ÂÂ published in 1992. Ã¢ÂÂI remember the exhilaration of working through the night in the lab, drinking thick pasty coffee that had been on the burner for hours, walking out into the sunrise. Ã¢ÂÂ He added: Ã¢ÂÂTo be alone and out on the edge like that, there was no feeling like it in the world. Ã¢ÂÂ When Dr. Rosenberg arrived at the National Cancer Institute in 1974, his first attempt at immunotherapy was to give patients   harvested from pigs. That failed. He then began giving patients   or   a protein made by the body that spurs   to proliferate. In some cases he treated patients with their own white blood cells that had been incubated in  . The treatments sometimes set off such a violent immune system reaction that patients had to be placed in intensive care. From 1980 to 1984, he treated 66 patients without success. Then, in late 1984, he encountered patient No. 67, Linda Taylor, a Navy officer with melanoma whose personnel file carried the stamp Ã¢ÂÂdeath imminent. Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Taylor is still alive her case and others catapulted Dr. Rosenberg and   onto the cover of Newsweek and the front pages of newspapers. Some of his colleagues at the National Cancer Institute began referring to him as Stevie Wonder, thinking he had developed a swelled head. But  Ã¢ÂÂs vaunted prowess fizzled, helping only a few percent of patients with melanoma or kidney cancer. Dr. Rosenberg then tried to surgically remove tumors and extract the   that had already penetrated them,     lymphocytes. He multiplied those cells in the lab and infused them back in the patient, along with shots of  . He limited his focus to melanoma, the skin cancer that seemed most susceptible to immune attack. The treatment eventually achieved remissions in about 10 percent to 25 percent of patients. But it was   and its application to other cancers unclear. There had to be a better way. Indeed, one approach was taking shape across the street from Dr. Rosenberg, at the Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda. The Navy was not Carl JuneÃ¢ÂÂs desired career choice. Accepted at Stanford in 1971, he instead chose the Naval Academy to avoid the draft and Vietnam. The Navy sent him to medical school and for training in   transplantation, geared toward treating people irradiated by nuclear weapons. When the Cold War ended, the Navy lost interest. Dr. June turned to working with   at the Naval Medical Research Institute in the  . He and a colleague, Dr. Bruce Levine, found a way to multiply   in huge numbers outside the body, a method still used today. And in the   working with Cell Genesys, a gene therapy company, Dr. June began trying to genetically modify patientsÃ¢ÂÂ   to kill H. I. V. the virus that causes AIDS. But when his wife, Cindy, the mother of the coupleÃ¢ÂÂs three children, developed ovarian cancer in 1996, Dr. JuneÃ¢ÂÂs research turned personal. Dr. June had tried everything to save her, including the primitive immune therapies under development. But Ms. June died in 2001. Ã¢ÂÂA lot of other scientists would have been disillusioned by the failure, in his case the personal tragedy,Ã¢ÂÂ said Sean Parker, the internet billionaire who is funding some of Dr. JuneÃ¢ÂÂs work. Instead, Dr. June, who had moved to the University of Pennsylvania, stopped treating patients, and devoted himself to creating cell therapies for cancer. Ã¢ÂÂThings that were back burner on cell therapy became front burner,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. In the 1980s, scientists began experimenting with gene therapy, putting new genes into cells of the body to treat disease. Michel Sadelain, while still a graduate student studying immunology at the University of Alberta, told colleagues that he thought the technique could be used to supercharge   to fight cancer. Ã¢ÂÂAt the time it sounded very pipe dream,Ã¢ÂÂ said Douglas Green, who was one of Dr. SadelainÃ¢ÂÂs doctoral thesis advisers and is now chairman of immunology at St. Jude ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Research Hospital. But Dr. Sadelain, he continued, Ã¢ÂÂbelieved in his approach and he pursued it relentlessly. Ã¢ÂÂ After earning his Ph. D. Dr. Sadelain headed for the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass. to learn how to do gene therapy, using disabled viruses that could not cause disease to deliver genes into cells. By 1992, he had demonstrated that he could genetically engineer mouse  . He then moved to Sloan Kettering. In 2003, he and his colleagues  Ã¢ÂÂ   including his partner and now wife, Isabelle RiviÃÂ¨re  Ã¢ÂÂ   showed that genetically engineered   could eradicate certain cancers in mice. How is this done? To fight cancer,   have to recognize cancerous cells. Each   in the body has unique receptors, sort of like claws that jut out from its surface.   patrol the body looking for protein fragments that indicate a cell might be infected by a bacterium or virus. If one of its claws latches on to such a fragment, the   destroys the cell displaying it. But cancer cells are mutated versions of the bodyÃ¢ÂÂs own cells, not outsiders.   do not always recognize them as something to kill. So scientists like Dr. Sadelain decided to put a new claw on the   one that could recognize cancer by latching on to a telltale protein on cancer cells. The new claws came from another part of the immune system known as antibodies. Drug companies already knew how to make antibodies with claws that bind to specific proteins in the body. But the claw was not enough. Once a claw binds to a target protein, it needs a molecule to signal the   to go into killing mode. Yet another signal helps sustain the killing. The DNA instructions for all three components are inserted into the patientÃ¢ÂÂs  . Since this concoction is part antibody and part   it is a chimera, like the monster of Greek mythology that is part lion, part goat and part serpent. The claw is called a receptor and the protein it binds to on the cancer cell, the target, is called an antigen. So the whole construct is called a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, and the use of it to treat cancer is called CAR   therapy, or  . Dr. Sadelain was not alone in this work. Zelig Eshhar, an Israeli scientist, is credited with developing one of the first crude CARs around 1989. Dr. Rosenberg, always on the lookout for new types of immunotherapy, invited Dr. Eshhar to be a visiting scientist in his laboratory at the National Cancer Institute. Another early developer was Dr. Dario Campana of St. Jude ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Research Hospital. As scientists worked to perfect the formula in the 1990s and early 2000s, there was quite a bit of sharing. Cancer cell therapy was still mostly an academic exercise it was highly uncertain whether it would ever really work. Dr. June, after hearing a presentation by Dr. Campana at a conference in 2003, requested a sample of Dr. CampanaÃ¢ÂÂs CAR. Dr. Sadelain shared his design with both Dr. June and Dr. Rosenberg. The most prominent CAR developed at the National Cancer Institute owes a lot to Dr. Sadelain, Dr. Rosenberg said. But the science proved difficult and the research money scarce. Pharmaceutical companies showed little interest, preferring   drugs, one size fits all, rather than a treatment that would be made separately for each patient. Again, a death from cancer propelled the field forward. In 2001, a    woman, Kimberly Lawrence Netter, succumbed to breast cancer. Her    Edward Netter, a wealthy financial services entrepreneur, and his wife, Barbara, formed the nonprofit Alliance for Cancer Gene Therapy, which issued some of its first grants to Dr. June and Dr. Sadelain. Dr. June also got support from the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. Ã¢ÂÂWithout that,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. June said of the charities, Ã¢ÂÂwe would not have had a clinical trial. Ã¢ÂÂ As the first decade of this century neared its end, the three pioneers were ready for the big moment  Ã¢ÂÂ   testing their treatments in patients. They scrambled to be the first to announce   results. Dr. Rosenberg and colleagues published first, in the journal Blood in 2010. They described a single patient with lymphoma whose tumors shrank after treatment. (The patient later received more therapy, and has been free of cancer since.) But the approach really attracted attention the next year when Dr. June reported that two of three patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia went into complete remission. One of them, Doug Olson, a chemist from Tinicum Township, Pa. left the hospital and immediately bought a sailboat. He also took to running  . Ã¢ÂÂIt was like this weight that had been sitting there was gone,Ã¢ÂÂ said Mr. Olson, who is free of cancer nearly six years later. Bill Ludwig, a retired captain in the New Jersey Department of Corrections, had already paid for his funeral when he started treatment in August 2010. Once his genetically engineered   were unleashed in his system, Mr. LudwigÃ¢ÂÂs lungs started to fail, his legs ballooned to twice their size, his blood pressure dropped and he began hallucinating. When he emerged from the ordeal, doctors searched for cancer. Detecting none, they ordered another test, certain of error. But there was no mistake. Five pounds of tumor had been destroyed. Mr. Ludwig, now 71, and his wife bought an R. V. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre trying to make up for lost time,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. He has celebrated the high school graduations of five grandchildren and welcomed his first  . As for Dr. June, Mr. Ludwig said: Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs hard to describe someone who basically saved your life. He lost the one he loved, and turned around and saved me years later. Ã¢ÂÂ The 2011 publication of Dr. JuneÃ¢ÂÂs results transformed the field. Novartis, the big Swiss pharmaceutical company, licensed the rights to the therapies created in Dr. JuneÃ¢ÂÂs lab at the University of Pennsylvania, throwing aside concerns that treatments manufactured for individual patients would not be good business. That set off a commercial rush, flooding the field with cash after years of doubt. While various companies are in pursuit, three are in the lead. They hope to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration to bring the first CAR treatments to market as early as 2017 or 2018, although it is not yet clear how easy it will be to get regulatory approval for such a novel therapy. The companies are teamed with academic pioneers: Novartis with Penn Kite Pharma with the National Cancer Institute and Juno Therapeutics with Sloan Kettering, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and Seattle ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital. Somewhat predictably, success provoked jostling and envy. Rather than being allies against a disbelieving world, the pioneers now had something worth fighting over  Ã¢ÂÂ   credit, and the gleam of a possible Nobel Prize. While the Sloan Kettering researchers had done some of the early genetic engineering, they did not publish strong results in five patients until 2013. By then, they had been scooped by Dr. Rosenberg with one patient and Dr. June with three. The spotlight further shifted to Dr. June because of his success with Emily Whitehead, a little girl whose miraculous recovery in 2012 made her the poster child for cell therapy. When Mr. Parker, the internet entrepreneur, announced in April that he would spend $250 million to start a new cancer immunotherapy institute, Emily, now 11, appeared on stage at the launch extravaganza with Lady Gaga. Dr. JuneÃ¢ÂÂs 2011 publications did not cite Dr. RosenbergÃ¢ÂÂs paper from the previous year, prompting Dr. Rosenberg to write a letter to The New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. JuneÃ¢ÂÂs publications also did not acknowledge that the genetic construct he had used was the one he had obtained from Dr. Campana of St. Jude. St. Jude sued the University of Pennsylvania. Novartis sided with Penn, and Juno Therapeutics with St. Jude. The suit was settled last year, with Novartis agreeing to pay $12. 25 million plus possible future payments and royalties. Within days, Dr. June sent a correction and letter of regret to The New England Journal of Medicine, acknowledging that the CAR used in his groundbreaking 2011 study, and in treating Emily Whitehead, was Ã¢ÂÂdesigned, developed and providedÃ¢ÂÂ by St. Jude. Patrick M. Coughlin, who teaches anatomy at the Commonwealth Medical College in Scranton, Pa. now explains the immune system to his classes by telling how one man overcame cancer. Only gradually does it become clear that he is referring to himself. Now 63, Mr. Coughlin noticed a mass the size of a softball in his abdomen in summer 2013. It was a form of  Ã¢ÂÂs lymphoma. Three different types of chemotherapy and a   transplant all failed to help him. Desperate, he came to the National Institutes of Health campus here last year for the cell therapy developed by Dr. RosenbergÃ¢ÂÂs team. The battle between Mr. CoughlinÃ¢ÂÂs genetically engineered immune cells and the cancer was brutal. For four days he had a fever as high as 105, chills and   sweats. Even his brain malfunctioned  Ã¢ÂÂ   at one point he could not count to 10 or write his wifeÃ¢ÂÂs name. But when the battle ended, the cancer was no longer there. Ã¢ÂÂIf I had gotten this thing five years ago,Ã¢ÂÂ he said of his disease, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂd be dead. Ã¢ÂÂ Yet for all the excitement, there are reasons for caution. The CAR therapy works now only for patients with some   lymphomas and leukemias, which account for only about 80, 000 of the 1. 7 million cases of cancer diagnosed in the United States each year. It has not been successfully used to treat malignancies of the lungs, breast, prostate, colon or other organs. Ã¢ÂÂThe solid tumors that kill over 90 percent of people do not respond to anything we have now,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Rosenberg said. Because it is personalized, cell therapy is likely to be frightfully expensive  Ã¢ÂÂ   probably hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient, though the companies bringing these treatments to market have not yet said how much they would charge. Producing the   cells is lengthy and complex. Some patients have died during the two to four weeks it took to genetically modify and multiply their cells. And the therapy itself can be arduous. First, patients get chemotherapy to wipe out many of their existing   to make room for the engineered ones. Once those enter the body, they can set off a ferocious immune response as well as temporary neurological problems like memory loss, seizures and hallucinations. Recently Juno Therapeutics had to temporarily halt its clinical trial after three patients died from brain swelling. The problem arose when the company added a second chemotherapy drug to the regimen preparing the patients for the cell infusion. The authorities allowed the trial to resume without that chemotherapy drug. Still, some patients find themselves hoping they get violently ill, since that is a sign the treatment is working. Ã¢ÂÂEvery morning my wife would ask me how IÃ¢ÂÂm feeling,Ã¢ÂÂ said Myles Stiefvater, a copier salesman from Newark, Del. who had the treatment in 2014. When he said he felt O. K. they were disappointed. Researchers are also finding, to their dismay, that remissions do not always last. The therapy has had its biggest success in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, producing complete remissions for 60 percent to more than 90 percent of patients. Yet up to half of those patients eventually suffer a relapse. In some cases, the tumor evolves so that it no longer displays on its surface what the claw binds to, making it invisible to the engineered cells. In other cases, the engineered cells might not last long enough in the body, giving the cancer a chance to resurge. Karen Shollenberger, a student at Drexel University with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, thought she was in the clear after being in remission for nine months after a   treatment. But in September, as the school year was beginning, the cancer returned. Ã¢ÂÂMy high hopes for the rest of the term were crushed,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Shollenberger wrote on her blog in October. She entered a new trial testing a new CAR therapy directed at another protein on  . Again the cancer went into remission, and she returned to school. But fear lurked in her: What if the new therapy also stopped working? That indeed happened recently. Her best hope now is a   transplant. Ã¢ÂÂEach relapse is increasingly terrifying as the options continue to shrink,Ã¢ÂÂ said Ms. Shollenberger, 22. But, she said, the cell therapies have given her nearly two good years. The big thrust now is to expand the use of cell therapy to additional types of cancer. The key is to find protein targets that the engineered   can latch on to to kill cancer cells. Ideally, such a protein should be on all the tumor cells, so the entire cancer would be eradicated. But it should not be on healthy cells, or they would also be destroyed, causing side effects. Ã¢ÂÂ  are very powerful,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Campana, formerly of St. Jude and now at the National University of Singapore. Ã¢ÂÂIn the same way they can eliminate cancer, they can also kill you. Ã¢ÂÂ A protein called HER2, for instance, is found on many breast and other tumors, making it a seemingly good target. But it is also found in tiny amounts in the lungs. When Dr. RosenbergÃ¢ÂÂs team infused killer   aimed at HER2 into a patient, she went into respiratory distress within 15 minutes and died five days later. The treatments work for the blood cancers because there is a good target. But finding these for the most common cancers has been difficult. One problem is that CARs, because of how they are made, can bind only to proteins on the surface of cancer cells. But most proteins made by these cells, or by any cell for that matter, are inside the cell, out of reach. There is an alternative approach that is gaining interest. PatientsÃ¢ÂÂ immune cells can be engineered to make what are called   receptors, or TCRs. These can recognize proteins inside the cancer cells. Some experts say TCRs, which have a far wider array of potential targets, represent the best hope of using cell therapy to treat solid tumors. There have been hints of effectiveness already in treating one of those, a type of sarcoma. It might turn out that the best target for each patient will be unique to that person. Scientists are now experimenting with using DNA sequencing and other techniques to find the best mutated protein in each personÃ¢ÂÂs tumor at which to aim the claw. Ã¢ÂÂThink of how dauntingly personalized this is,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Rosenberg said. Ã¢ÂÂWe are using their own cells to treat a unique mutation in their own tumor. Ã¢ÂÂ He said this approach might allow cell therapy to be used for most patients. Many other improvements are on the runway. Dr. Sadelain and Juno are working on Ã¢ÂÂarmored CARsÃ¢ÂÂ that not only bind to the target but produce   chemicals. Cellectis, a French company, has treated two babies with an    CAR treatment that does not require each patientÃ¢ÂÂs cells to be processed. Bellicum Pharmaceuticals is working on genetic switches that dim or shut off the CAR if the treatment is endangering the patient. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre in the Model T version of the CAR now,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Levine, now the director of the cell production facility at the University of Pennsylvania. Ã¢ÂÂWhatÃ¢ÂÂs coming along are Google CARs and Tesla CARs. Ã¢ÂÂ In February, the   Center for Advanced Cellular Therapeutics opened on the ninth floor of a Penn medical building, paid for mainly by $20 million from Novartis. It has gleaming new laboratory space, clean rooms with the capacity to manufacture therapy for 400 patients a year, and a great view of downtown Philadelphia. On the wall are photographs of patients with success stories, like Doug Olson running a   and, of course, Emily Whitehead. Dr. June, who remarried and had two more children, now jets off regularly to attend conferences and give talks. A world map hanging outside his office is titled Ã¢ÂÂWhere in the World Is Carl June?Ã¢ÂÂ It has pins stuck in every location he has been, and a picture of him on a bicycle pinned to his location at the moment. In the last two years he has visited more than 150 cities in more than 20 countries. This year alone he has accumulated more than 200, 000 airline miles. Despite that schedule, he runs ultramarathons and participated in July in the Death Ride, a grueling bicycle race in California. Dr. Rosenberg still arrives at the National Cancer Institute nearly seven days a week. The walls outside his office are covered with signed photographs of the hundreds of fellows who have trained under him, many of them now leaders in immunotherapy. Every five years, they gather for a reunion, to reminisce and honor their mentor. Arie Belldegrun, who was a fellow in the 1980s, now runs Kite, the company commercializing the National Cancer InstituteÃ¢ÂÂs CAR technology. He recounted what happened when he tried to get Dr. Rosenberg to join the company. Ã¢ÂÂHe sits quietly, quietly, quietly, and then he asks, Ã¢ÂÂArie, why donÃ¢ÂÂt you ask me what I want to do?Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂHe said: Ã¢ÂÂEvery day that I go to work, IÃ¢ÂÂm as excited as a kid coming to a new place for the first time. If you ask me what I want to do, I want to die on this desk one day. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ But not before he conquers cancer. Ã¢ÂÂI want to end this holocaust,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Rosenberg said in the interview. Ã¢ÂÂI think IÃ¢ÂÂm finally getting the hang of what it will take to widely apply this to cancers.

2013,"When is it safe for a woman with breast cancer to skip chemotherapy? A new study helps answer that question, based on a test of gene activity in tumors. It found that nearly half of women with   breast cancer who would traditionally receive chemo can avoid it, with little risk of the cancer coming back or spreading in the next five years. The   genomic test measures the activity of genes that control the growth and spread of cancer, and can identify women with a low risk of recurrence and therefore little to gain from chemo. Ã¢ÂÂMore and more evidence is mounting that there is a substantial number of women with breast cancer who will not need chemotherapy to do well,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Rachel A. Freedman, a breast cancer oncologist at the   Cancer Institute in Boston. She was not involved in the study. The researchers estimated that their findings, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, would apply to 35, 000 to 40, 000 women a year in the United States, and 60, 000 to 70, 000 in Europe. They are patients with early disease who because of tumor size, cancerous lymph nodes and other factors would normally be prescribed chemo. Genomic tests, which doctors have been using for about 10 years in some breast cancer patients, are part of a growing effort to spare women from chemo and its harsh side effects whenever it is safe to do so. But the decision to forgo a potentially lifesaving treatment is never taken lightly, and doctors have been eager for more data to make sure they are on the right path. The new study is one of the largest and most rigorous trials of genomic testing, and offers reassurance to doctors and patients that the technology can be trusted to help identify patients who do not need chemo. But an editorial accompanying the report said the study was not the final word, and additional research now underway would provide more clarity. Although women who skipped chemo had low recurrence rates, their rates were slightly higher than those of women who had chemo. A test called Oncotype DX is widely used in the United States. The new study used another, called MammaPrint, which is used less often. The tests cost several thousand dollars, and insurance coverage varies. Dr. Kathryn J. Ruddy, a breast cancer specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. who was not part of the research, said in an email that the study was important because Ã¢ÂÂit will help more patients avoid the toxicities of chemotherapy (potentially including permanent nerve damage, heart failure and leukemia). Ã¢ÂÂ The risks from certain types of chemo increase with the patientÃ¢ÂÂs age. The risk of leukemia is about 0. 5 percent to 1 percent, and the heart risk can reach 4 percent or 5 percent in older women, Dr. Freedman said. The results of the study will be of most use for cases that have fallen into a gray zone, when the disease is in an early stage but has some anatomical features that suggest it may be aggressive. But the genomic test says it is low risk. Ã¢ÂÂWe all see these patients in our practice all the time,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Freedman said. Ã¢ÂÂWhat do you do with that person?Ã¢ÂÂ The study involved women with early cases of the most common type of breast cancer:   tumors that test negative for a receptor called her2. In the United States, about three quarters of breast cancers are that type. Early stage in the study referred to Stage 1 or 2, meaning the tumors were generally no bigger than five centimeters and had spread to no more than three lymph nodes. The study was done in Europe, where Ã¢ÂÂearly stageÃ¢ÂÂ includes somewhat larger tumors than would be included in the United States. More than half of the breast cancers in the United States are diagnosed at early stages. The research involved 6, 693 women with   breast cancer at 112 hospitals in nine European countries. The study was paid for by grants from governments, drug companies and charitable groups. Agendia, the company that markets MammaPrint, did the testing at no cost. The women had the usual initial treatments  Ã¢ÂÂ   surgery, hormonal therapy and radiation. Then, researchers determined whether each woman had a high or low risk of recurrence based on genomic testing and on clinical features like tumor size and number of positive lymph nodes. Sometimes, the clinical and genomic risks did not match. MammaPrint looks at the activity of 70 genes. In a   tumor, 50 genes are turned off and 20 are active, according to Laura J. van Ã¢ÂÂt Veer, a molecular biologist at the University of California, San Francisco who was an author of the study and a developer of the test. In   cases, 50 genes are on and 20 off. The researchers were especially interested in the women  Ã¢ÂÂ   about a quarter of those in the study  Ã¢ÂÂ   who seemed to have a high clinical risk but a low genomic risk. Dr. Fatima Cardoso, an author of the study and a breast oncologist at Champalimaud Clinical Center in Lisbon, said that traditionally, women with early cancer but a high clinical risk were usually given chemotherapy. She said that doctors knew that not all would benefit from it, but gave it to all anyway to err on the side of caution, because they could not identify which women did not really need it. The main goal of the study was to find out whether women with a high clinical risk but a low genomic risk could safely forgo chemo. There were 1, 550 women with high clinical risk and low genomic risk. They were assigned at random to be treated according to their genomic risk or their clinical risk. So some received chemotherapy, and others did not. Then the researchers watched to see if any had distant spread of the cancer to other organs, which is often fatal. After five years, among those who did not receive chemotherapy, 94. 4 percent had no distant spread. Those who received chemo fared slightly better: 95. 9 percent had no distant spread. Ã¢ÂÂWe have to continue to follow these patients and see what happens at 10 years,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Cardoso said. But given the small difference so far, the researchers said that it was safe for women with early disease and high clinical risk, but low genomic risk, to skip chemotherapy. The findings, they said, mean that 46 percent of women with   disease who are thought to be at high clinical risk may be able to skip chemo. An editorial accompanying the article praised the research but sounded a note of caution. The authors, Dr. Clifford A. Hudis and Dr. Maura N. Dickler, from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said that the study was not large enough to be sure that the 1.   difference would hold up statistically. The editorial also noted that other studies of genomic tests had identified groups of women in whom the   recurrence risk was only 1 percent, and asked what level of risk was acceptable. PatientsÃ¢ÂÂ attitudes also differ. Dr. Freedman said some women wanted no part of chemo, even if it offered a significant benefit. But, she added, Ã¢ÂÂothers line up at the door for almost no benefit, just so they can have peace of mind.

2014,"Max Ritvo, an accomplished poet who spent much of his life under the cloud of cancer while gaining wide attention writing and speaking about it, died of the disease on Tuesday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 25. His mother, Dr. Ariella   confirmed his death. Mr. Ritvo talked about his work and illness in interviews on radio programs including Ã¢ÂÂOnly HumanÃ¢ÂÂ on WNYC and Ã¢ÂÂThe New Yorker Radio Hour. Ã¢ÂÂ His poems have appeared in Poetry Magazine and The New Yorker, and his first published volume of poetry, Ã¢ÂÂFour Reincarnations,Ã¢ÂÂ will appear in the fall. The poet Louise GlÃÂ¼ck, who taught Mr. Ritvo at Yale, called the book Ã¢ÂÂone of the most original and ambitious first books in my experience,Ã¢ÂÂ adding that his work is Ã¢ÂÂmarked by intellectual bravado and verbal extravagance. Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Ritvo was 16 when he learned he had EwingÃ¢ÂÂs sarcoma, a rare pediatric cancer. He had gone to doctors after feeling pain in his side. At first they suspected pneumonia, but fearing something worse they took a tissue sample while he was under sedation. He woke up in a cancer ward. Ã¢ÂÂI remember thinking, Ã¢ÂÂThis is so terrible! Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ he told Mary Harris of WNYC. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm just a young, acrobatic, wiry, handsome bloke of 16, and itÃ¢ÂÂs so sad for all these old people, because they must have run out of beds and I just have pneumonia. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ A year of aggressive treatment brought about remission, and over the next four and a half years he finished high school and attended Yale. The cancer returned in Mr. RitvoÃ¢ÂÂs senior year. He nevertheless completed his degree in 2013 and this year earned a master of fine arts from Columbia University, where he became a teaching fellow. He also served as poetry editor at Parnassus: Poetry in Review. Throughout his illness, he rejected the clichÃÂ©s of being an Ã¢ÂÂinspiring victim of cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ his mother said. He counseled other families going through treatment for EwingÃ¢ÂÂs sarcoma, and spoke out often about the disease and the importance of research. His poetry, said a writer for Boston Review, is composed Ã¢ÂÂof candor, of splendor and of abandon. Ã¢ÂÂ It could veer from despair to humor in lines like these, from Ã¢ÂÂRadiation in New Jersey, Convalescence in New YorkÃ¢ÂÂ: I come from a place where the water is so barren that when you drink it the fish of the throat die, causing malignant thirst.  WhatÃ¢ÂÂs a dazzler like you doing in a dump like my bed? Last August Mr. Ritvo married Victoria   now a doctoral student in psychology at Princeton. They had met during a summer academic program at Cambridge University in 2005. After she moved from England to the United States, they began dating in 2013. Dr.   a research scientist, recalled that her son, thinking about marriage but knowing his prospects for survival were questionable, had asked her, Ã¢ÂÂIs it fair of me to propose?Ã¢ÂÂ Max Joseph Ritvo was born Dec. 19, 1990, in Los Angeles. A literary prodigy, he was writing at 3, his mother said. At Yale, he joined an experimental comedy group called His Majesty, the Baby. He entertained its other members with outlandish and often profane riffs, said Andrew Kahn, the groupÃ¢ÂÂs producer and manager. His sketches could be challenging for audiences: in one, he used the medical port in his chest as a kind of ventriloquistÃ¢ÂÂs dummy, putting googly eyes on the protrusion and jiggling it with his hand while chatting with it about cancer treatments. Mr. RitvoÃ¢ÂÂs body bore three tattoos depicting birds that he had acquired after enduring each new wound or scar. Ã¢ÂÂHe wanted to juxtapose it,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Ritvo explained, referring to his cancer, Ã¢ÂÂwith something beautiful. Ã¢ÂÂ In Ã¢ÂÂPoem to My Litter,Ã¢ÂÂ which The New Yorker published in June, Mr. Ritvo wrote of an experiment in which cells cloned from his tumors were placed in mice in the hope of finding more promising treatments. He names each of the mice Max. He wrote: My doctors split my tumors up and scattered them into the bones of twelve mice. We give the mice poisons I might, in the future, want for myself. We watch each mouse like a crystal ball. The   therapies did not emerge. He wrote: And since I do absolutely nothing (my pride, like my fur, all gone) nothing happens to me. And if a whole lot  of nothing happens to you, Maxes, thatÃ¢ÂÂs peace. Which is what we want. Trust me. Along with his wife and mother, Mr. Ritvo is survived by his father, Edward Ritvo his sisters, Victoria Ritvo Black and Skylre Oryx and a stepbrother, David Slifka. His stepfather, Alan B. Slifka, a New York investor and philanthropist who was the founding chairman of the Big Apple Circus, died in 2011. Dr.   leads a foundation that bears Mr. SlifkaÃ¢ÂÂs name and which, among other missions, supports research into sarcoma. In Max RitvoÃ¢ÂÂs final weeks, he remained cleareyed. In a podcast interview on Aug. 14 with the media personality Dr. Drew Pinsky, he said, his voice weak, Ã¢ÂÂThis is    stuff. Ã¢ÂÂ Over time, he said, his work had shifted Ã¢ÂÂaway from sort of ebullient death poetry and fighting poetry and poetry of, sort of, the bloods and the squirmies and the guts, and more toward trying to figure out what death is, and what my place in the world is. Ã¢ÂÂ His poetry sustained him, his family said. Ã¢ÂÂHe said the day he stopped writing, that would be the end of it,Ã¢ÂÂ his wife said in an interview. She added: Ã¢ÂÂHe was writing three days before he died. Ã¢ÂÂ On Monday, Dr.   said, her son was too weak to write poetry. Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs it,Ã¢ÂÂ she said quoting him. Ã¢ÂÂI canÃ¢ÂÂt write any more. Ã¢ÂÂ The family called in the hospice nurses, who gave him sedatives.

2015,"Kenneth P. Thompson, the first black district attorney of Brooklyn and a voice for racial justice at a moment of tension between law enforcement and minority communities, died on Sunday from cancer, his family said. He was 50. Mr. Thompson was elected district attorney in 2013 after campaigning on a platform of reform and racial justice, and unseating Charles J. Hynes, a fellow Democrat and a troubled incumbent who had served more than 20 years. After being absent from his office for nearly two months, Mr. Thompson released a statement on Tuesday saying he had cancer. His office released a second statement on Sunday night, announcing his death and saying that his family had been by his side at Memorial   Cancer Center in Manhattan when he died. A former federal prosecutor who went on to have a successful private law practice, Mr. Thompson earned a reputation in office as one of the countryÃ¢ÂÂs most progressive district attorneys, creating a robust internal unit that reviewed questionable convictions and establishing a policy of not prosecuting most   marijuana arrests. At a moment of heightened racial tension over   shootings, he chose to prosecute  Ã¢ÂÂ   and eventually won  Ã¢ÂÂ   the complicated case of Peter Liang, the former New York City police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black man, Akai Gurley, in the stairwell of a housing project in 2014. After the trial was over, Mr. Thompson decided not to seek prison time for Mr. Liang, which enraged Mr. GurleyÃ¢ÂÂs family and led to protests. Ã¢ÂÂThe thoughts and prayers of our entire city are with District Attorney Ken Thompson, his family and his loved ones tonight,Ã¢ÂÂ Mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife, Chirlane McCray, said in a statement on Sunday. Ã¢ÂÂWith a life and promise cut far too short, our city was blessed with but a glimpse of KenÃ¢ÂÂs unwavering commitment to justice and his unrivaled pursuit of a more fair system for all those he served. Ã¢ÂÂ Born and raised in New York City, Mr. Thompson was the son of a police officer and lived in public housing in Harlem before moving to   City, a housing development in the Bronx. He attended the cityÃ¢ÂÂs public schools and applied to the Police Department, as his mother had, before choosing instead to attend the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. After his graduation, he obtained a law degree from the New York University School of Law. On the advice of one of his law professors, Ronald K. Noble, a onetime Treasury Department official and the secretary general of Interpol, Mr. Thompson sought and found a position as a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn. In 1997, he was assigned the prestigious task of making the opening statement at the trial of Justin Volpe, a former police officer who eventually pleaded guilty to torturing a Haitian immigrant, Abner Louima, with a broken broomstick in the bathroom of a Brooklyn station house. After leaving government service, Mr. Thompson went into private practice. His most prominent case was representing an   hotel housekeeper, Nafissatou Diallo, who accused the French politician Dominique   of raping her in a Manhattan hotel room in 2011. Cyrus Vance Jr. the Manhattan district attorney, eventually dismissed the case, and Mr. Thompson was criticized for his incendiary personal attacks against Mr. Vance and members of his staff. Mr. Thompson had harbored ambitions for higher office, but, according to a friend who spoke on the condition of anonymity because Mr. Thompson declined to disclose the type of his cancer, learned he had an aggressive form of the disease this year. By the time he received the diagnosis, the cancer had already metastasized and was incurable. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo may now name a replacement for Mr. Thompson, who would have faced   next year. Ã¢ÂÂA lifelong New Yorker, Ken was known as an effective, aggressive civil rights leader  Ã¢ÂÂ   and a national voice for criminal justice reform,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Cuomo said in a statement on Sunday. Mr. Thompson is survived by his wife of 17 years,   Thompson his children, Kennedy and Kenny his mother his father his brother and his sister. In his own statement, Eric Gonzalez, Mr. ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs chief assistant, said that in his three years as BrooklynÃ¢ÂÂs district attorney, Mr. Thompson Ã¢ÂÂtransformed the office into a model urban prosecutorÃ¢ÂÂs office with a mandate to do justice and treat everyone and every case fairly and with the utmost integrity. Ã¢ÂÂ Police Commissioner James P. OÃ¢ÂÂNeill said: Ã¢ÂÂWe are deeply saddened by the death of District Attorney Ken Thompson. He dedicated his life to the pursuit of justice and his legacy will live on through his contributions to the criminal justice system.

2016,"Before Debbie Bowers had surgery for breast cancer, her doctor promised that insurance would pay for reconstruction, and said she could Ã¢ÂÂeven go up a cup size. Ã¢ÂÂ But Ms. Bowers did not want a silicone implant or bigger breasts. Ã¢ÂÂHaving something foreign in my body after a cancer diagnosis is the last thing I wanted,Ã¢ÂÂ said Ms. Bowers, 45, of Bethlehem, Pa. Ã¢ÂÂI just wanted to heal. Ã¢ÂÂ While plastic surgeons and oncologists aggressively promote breast reconstruction as a way for women to Ã¢ÂÂfeel whole again,Ã¢ÂÂ some doctors say they are beginning to see resistance to the surgery. Patients like Ms. Bowers are choosing to defy medical advice and social convention and remain breastless after breast cancer. They even have a name for the decision to skip reconstruction: They call it Ã¢ÂÂgoing flat. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂReconstruction is not a simple process,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Deanna J. Attai, a breast surgeon in Burbank, Calif. and a past president of the American Society of Breast Surgeons, adding that more of her patients, especially those with smaller breasts before diagnosis, were opting out of reconstruction. Ã¢ÂÂSome women just feel like itÃ¢ÂÂs too much: ItÃ¢ÂÂs too involved, there are too many steps, itÃ¢ÂÂs too long a process. Ã¢ÂÂ Social media has allowed these women to become more open about their decision to live without breasts, as well as the challenges, both physical and emotional, that have followed. For a recent video created by wisdo. com, a social media platform, and widely shared on Facebook, Ms. Bowers and her friend Marianne DuQuette Cuozzo, 51, removed their shirts to show their scarred, flat chests. And Paulette Leaphart, 50, a New Orleans woman whose clotting disorder prevented her from having reconstruction after a double mastectomy, walked topless from Biloxi, Miss. to Washington this summer to raise awareness about the financial struggles of cancer patients. Ã¢ÂÂBreasts arenÃ¢ÂÂt what make us a woman,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Leaphart said. The nascent movement to Ã¢ÂÂgo flatÃ¢ÂÂ after mastectomies challenges   assumptions about femininity and what it means to recover after breast cancer. For years, medical professionals have embraced the idea that breast restoration is an integral part of cancer treatment. WomenÃ¢ÂÂs health advocates fought for and won approval of the WomenÃ¢ÂÂs Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998, which requires health plans to cover prosthetics and reconstructive procedures. Since then, breast reconstruction has become standard care. More than 106, 000 reconstructive procedures were done last year, a 35 percent increase since 2000, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. While it is not known exactly what percentage of women opt for breast reconstruction after a mastectomy, one study found that in 2011, 63 percent of women who were candidates for the procedure chose to have it. In some parts of the United States, the number is closer to 80 percent today. In promoting the surgery, doctors cite studies that suggest breast reconstruction improves a womanÃ¢ÂÂs quality of life after cancer. But some women say that doctors focus too much on physical appearance, and not enough on the toll prolonged reconstructive procedures take on their bodies and their psyches. Up to   of women who undergo reconstruction experience complications. A systematic review of 28 studies found that women who went without reconstruction fared no worse, and sometimes did better, in terms of body image, quality of life and sexual outcomes. Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs the dirty little secret of breast reconstruction: The risk of a major complication is higher than for the average elective surgery,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Clara Lee, an associate professor of plastic surgery at Ohio State University who performs the procedure. Ms. Cuozzo, who appeared in the Facebook video with Ms. Bowers, spent a year having her breasts rebuilt after a double mastectomy, but after four infections in five months, she had the implants removed. The reconstruction, she said, Ã¢ÂÂwas getting worse than the cancer. Ã¢ÂÂ While some states, including New York, now require physicians to tell women about the availability of breast reconstruction, women say they often are not informed of the option to remain flat. Ã¢ÂÂI was never told there was a choice,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Cuozzo said. Ã¢ÂÂI went from the breast surgeon to the plastic surgeon, and they said, Ã¢ÂÂThis is what youÃ¢ÂÂre going to do. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Dr. David H. Song, chief of plastic surgery at the University of Chicago and immediate past president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, said that the risk of complications was real, but that focusing on them was like focusing on plane crashes when Ã¢ÂÂmillions of flights land safely. Ã¢ÂÂ Given advancements in surgical techniques, Ã¢ÂÂthe aesthetic result can be better than the native breast,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Song said. Ã¢ÂÂPatients can come out the other end looking more youthful, with a better aesthetic in her breast than before. Ã¢ÂÂ But it is that kind of talk  Ã¢ÂÂ   suggesting that a reconstructed breast is an improvement on a womanÃ¢ÂÂs natural breast  Ã¢ÂÂ   that enrages many women who have undergone mastectomies. For starters, a reconstructed breast is often numb and can no longer play a role in sexual arousal. It often lacks a nipple, since the nipple is usually removed in a mastectomy. After looking at photos of reconstructed breasts, Ã¢ÂÂI was slightly horrified,Ã¢ÂÂ said Charlie Scheel, 48, of Brooklyn, who decided against implants after a double mastectomy. Ã¢ÂÂYou donÃ¢ÂÂt have nipples and you have scars everywhere. Ã¢ÂÂ Rebecca Pine, a cancer survivor from Long Island who   a photography and writing project called Ã¢ÂÂThe Breast and the Sea,Ã¢ÂÂ said, Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs a tremendous amount to put your body through, and itÃ¢ÂÂs not like weÃ¢ÂÂre going to get our breasts back. Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Pine, 40, had reconstruction after her first mastectomy, but had the implant removed later when she had a prophylactic mastectomy on her other breast. Ã¢ÂÂThey donÃ¢ÂÂt look or feel, in most cases, like our breasts,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂThe nerves are cut, so theyÃ¢ÂÂre not receptive to feel or touch. Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Susan Love, author of a   book about breast health, said that doctors aiming to expand access to reconstruction may have become overly enthusiastic about the surgery. Ã¢ÂÂSurgeons became so proud of what we were able to do that we may have forgotten that not everybody may want it,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Love said. Dr. Marisa C. Weiss, founder of breastcancer. org, said doctors should not assume every patient wants reconstructed breasts. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve had   dancers who do not want reconstruction and nuns who say, Ã¢ÂÂI need reconstruction,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ she said. Some women say physicians pressured them to get implants. When Catherine Stapleton, of Florida, woke up after her mastectomy, she discovered that her breast surgeon, a woman, had left unsightly flaps of skin and tissue that could be used for breast reconstruction later, in case she changed her mind. Ã¢ÂÂWhen I woke up from anesthesia, I was in shock,Ã¢ÂÂ said Ms. Stapleton, 58, who is now facing additional major surgery to correct the first procedure. Geri Barish, president of the Long Island advocacy group 1 in 9, said a doctor had chided her when she opted against reconstruction. Ã¢ÂÂOne doctor said to me: Ã¢ÂÂHow can you walk around like that? You look deformed,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ she recalled. Support groups and social media have allowed women to share stories about the realities of reconstruction. Ã¢ÂÂA lot of the women in my support group had infections, and they were surprised at how many surgeries were involved,Ã¢ÂÂ said Alicia Staley, 45, who stayed flat after a double mastectomy. Ã¢ÂÂAs I compared notes, I wondered, Ã¢ÂÂWhy are all these women doing this to themselves? Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Coming to terms with a flat chest after breast cancer can be difficult. While some women wear a prosthesis in their bra, it is not uncommon for them to stop using it. Ã¢ÂÂTheyÃ¢ÂÂre heavy, theyÃ¢ÂÂre uncomfortable, and theyÃ¢ÂÂre in a sensitive area where you have scars,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Pine said. Women say they take many of the clothes they wore before surgery to Goodwill and begin wearing scarves and long strands of beads to hide their flat chests. Others try to embrace their new form by having elaborate tattoos inked where they once had breasts. Ms. Pine has a lotus flower tattoo on one side and a dragonfly on the other. Sara   39, a technical writer in Kalamazoo, Mich. tried two types of implants but had a constant burning sensation and got rid of them. She then started a virtual support group called Flat and Fabulous. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre not Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂBut many women never feel itÃ¢ÂÂs part of their body. Ã¢ÂÂ For Kate Cloudsparks, 64, a farmer in southern Iowa who has been flat since a preventive mastectomy 21 years ago, discovering the Flat and Fabulous Facebook page this year led to her first communication ever with women who had made the same choice. Ã¢ÂÂI didnÃ¢ÂÂt know anybody else like me. I was carrying it around for 20 years without having anywhere to share it,Ã¢ÂÂ she said.

2017,"Stuffed inside cookie tins and between the pages of books in Diane FieldsÃ¢ÂÂs kitchen are multitudes of recipes. Ms. Fields has clipped them from newspapers and kept them for years, intent on preparing and sampling them all. But for the past year, a cancer diagnosis has cast those aspirations in doubt. Ã¢ÂÂI wonÃ¢ÂÂt have the chance to cook my recipes,Ã¢ÂÂ said Ms. Fields, 69, who received the diagnosis in late 2015. Ã¢ÂÂThese are the things that come to mind when you go through something like this. Ã¢ÂÂ The first sign that something was wrong came in November last year with painful stomach cramps. Doctors told Ms. Fields that she had pancreatic cancer, the same cancer that claimed the lives of one of her grandmothers in 2004 and a brother in 2010. Ms. Fields was already saddled with health problems, including heart disease, osteoporosis and a torn meniscus that forced her to retire in 2009 as a senior case manager at a maternity shelter. Ã¢ÂÂI didnÃ¢ÂÂt cry,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Fields recalled. Ã¢ÂÂMy first inclination was what are we going to do about it? What kind of options do I have?Ã¢ÂÂ Last December, she began chemotherapy and radiation treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan to try to shrink her tumors. Ms. Fields is still undergoing chemotherapy. Ã¢ÂÂWith chemo, if IÃ¢ÂÂm not sick, IÃ¢ÂÂm still tired,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Even simple tasks, like a walk to the corner store, have left Ms. Fields suddenly and drastically immobilized. She feels discouraged about leaving her home. Her only child, Kimberly Fields, 46, is constantly by her motherÃ¢ÂÂs side. She had moved into her motherÃ¢ÂÂs apartment in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn a couple of years earlier when she was between jobs in retail. When her mother learned she had cancer, Kimberly Fields postponed her job search. Ã¢ÂÂSince I was here anyway, I said, Ã¢ÂÂLet me take care of my mother,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt mind certain things. IÃ¢ÂÂm not saying itÃ¢ÂÂs not stressful, but itÃ¢ÂÂs good stress. ItÃ¢ÂÂs my mother. Ã¢ÂÂ In addition to the crippling fatigue, the cancer has taken a psychological toll. Ms. Fields has found herself snapping at strangers for minor offenses and grousing about her daughterÃ¢ÂÂs overprotective nature. Her daughter hesitates to allow her to venture out on her own, leaving Ms. Fields frustrated by her confinement. Ã¢ÂÂThank God sheÃ¢ÂÂs here. She helps me,Ã¢ÂÂ Diane Fields said. Ã¢ÂÂBut you want to be able to do stuff on your own. Ã¢ÂÂ In May, Ms. Fields was dealt another setback. She was moved to a different insurance plan and forced to reapply for Medicaid. She then learned that the $1, 027 in Social Security benefits she receives each month disqualified her from regular Medicaid, and that she was responsible for paying $184 a month to offset the surplus income. This new financial demand, in addition to her medication costs, led to dwindling savings and put her rent into arrears. At that time, Ms. Fields sought the help of Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. It used $500 in Neediest funds to cover the missing portion of her rent. In November, Ms. Fields was granted a fair hearing from the state to object to her Medicaid changes. She succeeded, was reimbursed for past surplus payments and no longer has to pay the additional $184 every month. With that resolved, battling her cancer remains at the forefront. The mother and daughter try to stay strong, often to lift each otherÃ¢ÂÂs spirits. Ms. Fields said her first good cry had happened in private, and many months after the diagnosis. Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt know what it was that made me start crying,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂI was just sitting here thinking, and I just started crying, to let it out. Ã¢ÂÂ The Fieldses greet each day with faith, optimism and gratitude. Diane Fields praises her doctors and fellow patients at Sloan Kettering for their boundless optimism. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm not going to say youÃ¢ÂÂre not frightened,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Fields said. Ã¢ÂÂBut you canÃ¢ÂÂt just lie down and say this is it. Ã¢ÂÂ When she regains her strength, the recipes she has clipped will be waiting for her. So will a slow cooker, still in its packaging and sitting on a kitchen shelf. And she is eager to pull out her bread maker for a pizza dough recipe she has wanted to prepare. Ã¢ÂÂI havenÃ¢ÂÂt been able to do all that yet, but once the cancerÃ¢ÂÂs gone, I will,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Fields said.",cancer,Cancer Patient Awaits Day She Can Return to the Kitchen - The New York Times,2017.0,2017.0,17.0,
2018,"Enthusiasm for cancer immunotherapy is soaring, and so is Arie BelldegrunÃ¢ÂÂs fortune. Dr. Belldegrun, a physician,   Kite Pharma, a company that could be the first to market next year with a highly anticipated new immunotherapy treatment. But even without a product, Dr. Belldegrun has struck gold. His stock in Kite is worth about $170 million. Investors have profited along with him, as the companyÃ¢ÂÂs share price has soared to about $50 from an initial price of $17 in 2014. The results reflect widespread excitement over immunotherapy, which harnesses the bodyÃ¢ÂÂs immune system to attack cancer and has rescued some patients from   death. But they also speak volumes about the value of KiteÃ¢ÂÂs main scientific partner: the United States government. KiteÃ¢ÂÂs treatment, a form of immunotherapy called   was initially developed by a team of researchers at the National Cancer Institute, led by a longtime friend and mentor of Dr. Belldegrun. Now Kite pays several million a year to the government to support continuing research dedicated to the companyÃ¢ÂÂs efforts. The relationship puts American taxpayers squarely in the middle of one of the hottest new drug markets. It also raises a question: Are taxpayers getting a good deal? Defenders say that the partnership will likely bring a lifesaving treatment to patients, something the government cannot really do by itself, and that that is what matters most. Critics say that taxpayers will end up paying twice for the same drug  Ã¢ÂÂ   once to support its development and a second time to buy it  Ã¢ÂÂ   while the company reaps the financial benefit. Ã¢ÂÂIf this was not a   cancer treatment  Ã¢ÂÂ   if it was for a new solar technology, for example  Ã¢ÂÂ   it would be scandalous to think that some private investors are reaping massive profits off a   invention,Ã¢ÂÂ said James Love, director of Knowledge Ecology International, an advocacy group concerned with access to medicines. The debate goes squarely to one of the nationÃ¢ÂÂs most vexing challenges: rising health care and drug prices. Kite is one of a growing number of drug and biotech companies relying on federal laboratories. Analysts expect the company to charge at least $200, 000 for the new treatment, which is intended as a   therapy for patients. While the law allows the government to demand   concessions from its   partners, the government has declined to do so with Kite and generally disdains the practice. Insisting on lower prices, federal researchers say, would drive away innovative partners that speed the   process and benefit patients. But with the government doing so much pivotal research, others say that the private sector cannot afford to walk away. Ã¢ÂÂThe market is so reliant on the knowledge and   that comes out of the government and academic labs,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, director of the Program on Regulation, Therapeutics and Law at Brigham  WomenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital in Boston. Price curbs, he said, Ã¢ÂÂwould not suddenly lead to a total abandonment of this pipeline. It couldnÃ¢ÂÂt possibly. Ã¢ÂÂ Drug makers would be especially unlikely to turn away from immunotherapy, where the promising science has set off a Ã¢ÂÂgold rush mentality,Ã¢ÂÂ according to Mark Edwards of Bioscience Advisors, a company which tracks pharmaceutical licensing deals. The National Institutes of Health, the parent agency of the National Cancer Institute, currently has about 400 cooperative research agreements with companies, and licenses hundreds of patented inventions for   development. Kite executives and national health officials characterize their partnership as a model arrangement in a system established by Congress three decades ago. The system has given birth to the cancer drug Taxol, the AIDS drug Prezista, two cervical cancer vaccines and a widely used test for H. I. V. infection, among other innovations. KiteÃ¢ÂÂs first drug, called   could help thousands of patients each year in the United States with certain blood cancers. If it succeeds, it could generate sales of $1 billion to $2 billion annually, according to Wall Street analysts, making it among the most lucrative drugs to come from government research. But the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs share of any Kite success would be modest, much lower than some academic research groups have wrangled in immunotherapy deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Federal officials counter that the reward to the taxpayer is not money but the drug itself. Ã¢ÂÂThis is exactly the way things should work,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Steven Rosenberg, who has led the surgery branch at the National Cancer Institute for 42 years and led development of KiteÃ¢ÂÂs drug. Such partnerships, he said, are Ã¢ÂÂabsolutely essential or many discoveries will not see the light of day. Ã¢ÂÂ Moreover, government officials say, companies in such deals must take significant financial risks and expenditures on their own, without any guarantee that the drug will be approved. Kite says it has spent more than $200 million on research and development, including running larger clinical trials than those conducted by the cancer institute, and recently spent about $30 million to build a factory that will be able to make treatments for up to 5, 000 patients a year. Setting the price of the drug, Dr. Rosenberg said, Ã¢ÂÂis for the marketplace. Ã¢ÂÂ Like many business deals, this one began with a personal relationship  Ã¢ÂÂ   in this case between Dr. Rosenberg and Dr. Belldegrun. After finishing medical school in his native Israel, performing surgery in helicopters for the Israeli armed forces, and completing residency at Brigham  WomenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital, Dr. Belldegrun became a research fellow for Dr. Rosenberg at the N. C. I. It was 1985, and Dr. Belldegrun was put to work on a new project of Dr. RosenbergÃ¢ÂÂs  Ã¢ÂÂ   extracting   immune cells from cancer patients, multiplying them in the laboratory, and putting them back in. Ã¢ÂÂHe was one of the more outstanding fellows to come through,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Rosenberg, 76, who is widely considered a cancer research luminary. When the fellowship ended in 1988, Dr. Belldegrun became a prominent surgeon at the University of California, Los Angeles, but the two men stayed in touch. Eventually, Dr. Belldegrun, 67, got the entrepreneurial bug. He   a biotech company, Agensys, which was acquired by a bigger company for more than $500 million. He was also involved with Cougar Biotechnology, which developed the prostate cancer drug Zytiga and was acquired by Johnson  Johnson for $1 billion in May 2009. A month later, Dr. Belldegrun formed Kite with a group of colleagues and investors to pursue cancer immunotherapy. That same month, a Florida marine contractor named Eric Karlson, whose  Ã¢ÂÂs lymphoma was advancing despite four prior treatments, became the first patient treated by Dr. Rosenberg with what would eventually become  . The treatment entailed removing some of Mr. KarlsonÃ¢ÂÂs immune system T cells from his blood, genetically engineering them to recognize and fight his cancer, multiplying the T cells to huge numbers in the laboratory and transferring them back into his body. After two such treatments, Mr. Karlson remains alive and   eight years later. Kite initially thought it would pursue an approach to immunotherapy known as cancer vaccines, but in 2010, Dr. Belldegrun visited Dr. Rosenberg and was shown the   of Mr. Karlson and of a second patient. Dr. Belldegrun was bowled over. Ã¢ÂÂI had no doubt that this is going to be a drug and, more than that, it will become a platform for multiple products,Ã¢ÂÂ he recalled. Ã¢ÂÂWe never looked back. Ã¢ÂÂ Over the next two years, the National Cancer Institute worked out a deal with Kite that was signed in 2012. It was the first of eight contracts between the government and the company that generally take two forms. In one type of contract, Kite licenses patented inventions and agrees to pay the government royalties, roughly 5 percent of sales of any commercial product arising from a particular patent. However, there is no such license specifically for   because the underlying treatment was not patented by the N. C. I. so royalties will be minimal. Officials say the agency did not apply for a patent because the treatment was similar to what others had been developing. Also, at the time the treatment was first created, in 2007, immunotherapy was considered to have dim commercial prospects. Ã¢ÂÂBack then, we didnÃ¢ÂÂt even think about commercial aspects,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. James N. Kochenderfer, a scientist at the agency who designed the treatment when working in Dr. RosenbergÃ¢ÂÂs group. Under the second type of contract, known as a cooperative research and development agreement, Kite provides money to the N. C. I. to support research. Kite is now paying $3 million a year to Dr. RosenbergÃ¢ÂÂs lab and has provided $7. 5 million to it in total since 2012. Based on its regulatory filings, Kite is paying $7. 8 million a year for research agreements and licenses in total, with at least $4 million of that going to the cancer institute and the rest to academic or corporate partners. The taxpayer has invested, too. Dr. Rosenberg estimated that the government has spent roughly $10 million over the years on what has become  . He said KiteÃ¢ÂÂs $3 million a year is about equal to the taxpayer funding in that area and has helped speed research. These days, researchers from Kite and the cancer institute, typically including Dr. Rosenberg and Dr. Belldegrun, confer by conference call every other Thursday for 90 minutes. Kite employees have spent long periods at the N. C. I. learning how to manufacture the therapy and how to treat patients in advance with chemotherapy. Ã¢ÂÂWe shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt underestimate the value and the importance of N. I. H. not only to Kite but to the whole field of engineered   therapy,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Belldegrun said. When Kite signed its first deal with the cancer agency, he said, it Ã¢ÂÂtapped into six years of monumental work that they had done. Ã¢ÂÂ Some immunotherapy competitors marvel at the companyÃ¢ÂÂs coup in tapping into the agencyÃ¢ÂÂs expertise. Ã¢ÂÂThey got 20 years of research all together in one scoop,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Carlos Paya, chief executive of Immune Design, which is pursuing a different approach. But government officials say few, if any, other companies were interested in the technology at the time Dr. Belldegrun came calling. Dr. Rosenberg said that before Kite, a few companies, including Johnson  Johnson, had looked at an earlier version of his technology but were wary because treatment involved processing each patientÃ¢ÂÂs cells.   technology available to be licensed to companies is posted on the website of the National Institutes of Health. And when the agency intends to grant a license to a particular company, it publishes that in the Federal Register, inviting public comment and possible competing offers. Both steps were taken in the case of Kite, officials said. Kite did not get everything the cancer institute has developed in the field. Some other companies, including Opus Bio and Bluebird Bio, got rights to some products, in part because the companies had special expertise that the agencyÃ¢ÂÂs researchers desired. But Kite seems to have gotten the balance of them and N. C. I. technology accounts for the majority of its pipeline of possible products, though the company is diversifying. Dr. Rosenberg professes no interest in the business side of the Kite relationship. He does not own stock in any company, even Kite, though he could get up to $150, 000 a year in patent royalties if some of KiteÃ¢ÂÂs efforts pay off. Dr. Belldegrun, in contrast to his mentor, has commercial flair. He is known for his sharp business suits, lives in the   neighborhood of Los Angeles, and seems as comfortable on Wall Street or in high society as in the operating room. KiteÃ¢ÂÂs relationship with the N. C. I. is an important part of its appeal to investors. In some presentations, Dr. Belldegrun has shown a photograph of himself with Dr. Rosenberg in their younger days. And he persuaded Dr. Rosenberg to speak at KiteÃ¢ÂÂs first big meeting for investors in June 2015, the only time he has ever spoken to Wall Street. In emails obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by Knowledge Ecology International, Dr. Belldegrun praised Dr. RosenbergÃ¢ÂÂs talk and sent him copies of investment reports from the conference written by Wall Street analysts. Ã¢ÂÂThank you for making the effort to come to NY,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Belldegrun wrote. Ã¢ÂÂI heard only raving reviews about your presence and presentation. Ã¢ÂÂ The reliance of private companies on   research goes well beyond obvious cases like Kite. In many instances, companies work with universities or medical centers that, in turn, have been funded from the $32 billion annual budget of the National Institutes of Health. KiteÃ¢ÂÂs two main competitors, Novartis and Juno Therapeutics, for instance, derived similar immunotherapy treatments largely from academic institutions, developed at least in part with government funding. Novartis has a relationship with the University of Pennsylvania, and Juno with the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and Seattle ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital. Ã¢ÂÂFor the most important drugs youÃ¢ÂÂll see some   involvement,Ã¢ÂÂ said Bhaven Sampat, an associate professor of health policy and management at Columbia University. He was one author of a study that found that 9 percent of all drugs approved between 1988 and 2005 were based directly on a patent held by the public sector. But 47. 8 percent of the drugs relied at least indirectly on some federally funded research. The figures were higher for more medically important drugs: 17. 4 percent had a direct   patent, while 64. 5 percent had at least an indirect   influence. These figures are up sharply from before the 1980s. Such partnerships and licensing deals were encouraged by the 1980   and   Acts, and the 1986 Federal Technology Transfer Act. The laws are credited with   the biotechnology industry. But from the beginning, some people questioned whether taxpayers were getting a bad deal. Perhaps the   drug developed from a cooperative research and development agreement  Ã¢ÂÂ   the cancer drug Taxol  Ã¢ÂÂ   was the subject of several congressional hearings in the early 1990s that investigated whether the drugÃ¢ÂÂs maker,   Squibb, charged too much and whether the government recouped enough of its investment. In the end, the pricing was left unchanged. The N. I. H. argues that if it imposes pricing restrictions, it wonÃ¢ÂÂt get partners. In fact, in 1995, it struck from its negotiating tactics a goal that prices be Ã¢ÂÂreasonable. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂCompanies will not take technologies from us if we say the government will decide in the future what the price will be,Ã¢ÂÂ said Mark Rohrbaugh, who ran the technology transfer office at the institutes from 2001 to 2013 and is now an adviser to the agency. After the Ã¢ÂÂreasonable priceÃ¢ÂÂ clause was struck, he said, there was a threefold increase in partnership deals. The N. I. H. can collect royalties from successful products to help offset the costs of the research, but so far these royalties have been small, amounting to an estimated $135 million in the last fiscal year from 870 licenses, with the bulk of the money coming from a small number of drugs. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre not preoccupied with financial value,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Rohrbaugh said. Ã¢ÂÂOur mission is treatment of people and improving public health. Ã¢ÂÂ In that regard, the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs bet on a small company like Kite, which might have seemed risky, appears to be paying off so far. Dr. Belldegrun has largely delivered on promises to raise money, assemble an experienced staff, build the factory, conduct clinical trials and begin to apply for regulatory approval. Once considered the underdog to Novartis and Juno, Kite might be the first reach the market. Academic centers and companies often drive harder bargains in licensing technology. In some cases, academic centers own a stake in a company they license technology to, allowing them to reap a financial windfall if the company does well. Both the Hutchinson cancer center and Sloan Kettering have owned stock in Juno and are entitled to substantial payments  Ã¢ÂÂ   up to $350 million and $150 million  Ã¢ÂÂ   if JunoÃ¢ÂÂs stock reaches certain levels. The N. I. H. does not take equity positions in companies to avoid an appearance of a conflict of interest. So to critics of the government deals, drug prices are crucial to understanding taxpayer value. After all, they ask, is a drug truly widely available  Ã¢ÂÂ   which is what the government says is its measure of success  Ã¢ÂÂ   if it costs too much for some people? Rachel Sachs, an associate law professor at Washington University in St. Louis and expert in innovation policy, said the government had every right to seek price concessions. She noted that the government, through Medicare and Medicaid, was effectively buying its inventions back from itself. Ã¢ÂÂThe public is paying for the research and to the extent that many people, if not most, will pay through public insurance, weÃ¢ÂÂre paying again,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Hillary Clinton, in her campaign for president, promised to set new rules for federal support of research so that Americans Ã¢ÂÂget the value they deserveÃ¢ÂÂ for the money taxpayers spend in supporting research. It is not clear how   Donald J. Trump will approach these issues he has said he favors reducing health care costs, but Republicans, who control Congress, too, have opposed a government role in price setting. One mechanism to control pricing already exists. It is called   rights, and it lets the N. I. H. take back control of a patent on an invention made with federal funding if the drug is not being made available to the public on reasonable terms. The tool has gone unused. Earlier this year, Knowledge Ecology International and another advocacy group, the Union for Affordable Cancer Treatment, petitioned the agency to exercise   rights on Xtandi, a prostate cancer drug that was developed by federally funded researchers at U. C. L. A. It said the price in the United States of about $129, 000 a year, two to four times that in other developed countries, meant the drug was not reasonably available. The effort was supported by other public interest groups and some Democratic members of Congress. U. C. L. A. made more than $500 million by selling its royalty rights to the drug. But the N. I. H. declined to exercise its   rights on Xtandi, arguing that it was not qualified to judge whether a drugÃ¢ÂÂs price is reasonable and that a high price does not mean a drug is not being made available to the public. Ã¢ÂÂN. I. H. has made it clear that its job is not to decide prices of drugs, period,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Rohrbaugh said Kite says it has not decided what to charge for   but Dr. Belldegrun hinted that KiteÃ¢ÂÂs therapy might be relatively expensive because ideally it would be a single treatment that would cure the patient, not a drug that would have to be taken continuously. He added that Kite would take steps to make sure that everyone who needed the drug could get it. Meantime, the relationship between Kite and the National Cancer Institute is expanding to develop treatments for other cancers, including one technique Dr. Rosenberg thinks could be used to attack solid tumors like colon, breast and lung cancer. Ã¢ÂÂThe potential for broad applicability is huge,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. That could mean many lives saved and maybe more   drugs for Kite and its investors, with the American taxpayer right in the middle of the deal.",cancer,Harnessing the U.S. Taxpayer to Fight Cancer and Make Profits - The New York Times,2018.0,2018.0,18.0,
2019,"A new study offers important information to men who are facing difficult decisions about how to treat prostate cancer in its early stages, or whether to treat it at all. Researchers followed patients for 10 years and found no difference in death rates between men who were picked at random to have surgery or radiation, or to rely on Ã¢ÂÂactive monitoringÃ¢ÂÂ of the cancer, with treatment only if it progressed. Death rates from the cancer were low over all: only about 1 percent of patients 10 years after diagnosis. But the disease was more likely to progress and spread in the men who opted for monitoring rather than for early treatment. And about half the patients in the study who had started out being monitored wound up having surgery or radiation. The patients are still being followed, which should reveal whether the death rate will eventually increase for the men assigned to monitoring. Doctors say the findings should help reassure men that surgery and radiation are equally reasonable choices in the early stages of the disease. Ã¢ÂÂI can counsel patients better now,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Freddie C. Hamdy, a leader of the study from the University of Oxford, in England, said in an interview. Ã¢ÂÂI can tell them very precisely, Ã¢ÂÂLook, your risk of dying from cancer is very, very small. If you receive treatment you will get some benefit. It will reduce the disease from growing outside your prostate, but these are exactly the side effects you might expect. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Active monitoring involves regular clinic visits with physical exams of the prostate, periodic biopsies and blood tests for   antigen, or PSA, a substance that may indicate the disease is worsening. Between 40 and 50 percent of men with early prostate cancer in the United States now choose active monitoring. The study, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, was the first to include detailed information from patients about the side effects of treatment. Men who had surgery to remove the prostate were the most likely to have lingering impotence and urinary incontinence. Those given radiation reported bowel problems after six months of treatment (usually with gradual improvement) but not urinary incontinence. Sexual function also diminished after radiation, but recovered somewhat. But there were no differences among the three groups in anxiety, depression or their feelings about how their health affected their quality of life. Dr. Peter T. Scardino, a prostate surgeon and chairman of the department of surgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York who was not involved in the study, said the research was important because there was little previous data comparing surgery, radiation and careful monitoring in men with early prostate cancer. Dr. Scardino said the findings helped confirm that active monitoring is a valuable approach for many men. He said that it was appropriate for a third to a half of men with early prostate cancers, and that only a third of those patients would need treatment within 10 years. But Dr. Scardino emphasized that the monitoring must be done regularly and with great care, for the rest of a patientÃ¢ÂÂs life. He added that an important message from the study is that early prostate cancer is not an emergency, and men have time to decide what to do about it. Worldwide, there were 1. 1 million cases of prostate cancer and 307, 000 deaths from it in 2012, the latest year data were collected by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. In the United States, about 181, 000 cases and 26, 000 deaths are expected in 2016. The average age at diagnosis is 66 in the United States, and the disease rarely occurs in men under 40. Most men who have prostate cancer do not die from it, according to the American Cancer Society. The disease often grows very slowly  Ã¢ÂÂ   but not always. Some cases are potentially deadly, but tests cannot always tell which ones. The uncertainty leaves many men in a quandary, particularly because of the bowel, bladder and sexual problems from treatment. In 2012, the United States Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of experts picked by the government, recommended against routine screening for prostate cancer with the PSA test. The group said screening finds many tumors that may never have harmed the patient, and leads too many men into unneeded surgery or radiation, with their troubling side effects. Dr. HamdyÃ¢ÂÂs team set out to address the quandary. They studied 1, 643 patients in Britain ages 50 to 69 who had early prostate cancers, found with routine PSA testing and then a biopsy if the PSA was abnormal. All the cancers were localized, meaning they were confined to the prostate and had not spread to nearby tissue outside the gland, or to distant organs. The patients had PSA measurements of 3 or higher, and about three quarters had a Gleason score of 6 the rest had higher Gleason scores. Gleason scores are a measure of aggressiveness and range from 6 to 10 in cancers, with higher scores being worse. The patients were then assigned at random to one of three groups: A third had surgery, a third had radiation, and a third had active monitoring. Though death rates from the cancer did not differ, more men on active monitoring had progression. The disease spread to distant parts of the body in 33 men on monitoring, 13 who had surgery and 16 who had radiation. The differences were statistically significant. Other progression, to nearby tissue outside the prostate, was also more common with monitoring: 112 cases, compared with 46 each in the surgery and radiation groups. As time went on, more and more of the monitored patients wound up having treatment. Dr. Hamdy said not all those who left monitoring actually needed treatment. Ã¢ÂÂWe know that 80 percent of them had not shown signs of progression,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, adding that anxiety on the part of the patients or their doctors, or some suspicion of progression, may have pushed them into treatment. Robert Boulton, 76, a retired maker of rubber gloves, was initially assigned to active monitoring but switched to radiation treatment after four years, when his PSA went up. In an interview, he said two doctors recommended the treatment and one opposed it, so he went with the majority advice. He said his only side effect was what he called Ã¢ÂÂman boobs,Ã¢ÂÂ swelling in the breast area from the hormonal treatment that is given along with radiation. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm feeling fine now,Ã¢ÂÂ he added. Ã¢ÂÂNo problems. Ã¢ÂÂ Another patient, Douglas Collett, 73, was also assigned to active monitoring in 2008 and has stayed with it. When he was first told he had cancer, he wanted to get rid of it immediately, he said. But when he learned more about the disease and the side effects of treatment, waiting made more sense, and he actually felt relieved when he was picked for the monitoring arm of the study. He realizes the disease could progress, he said, and if it does he will probably have radiation to treat it. In the meantime, he said, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm fit as a flea.

Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂAs a man of intense faith, I intend to fight and win the battle against this disease,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Thompson said. Ã¢ÂÂI humbly seek your sincere prayers as I confront this challenge and respectfully ask that you honor my familyÃ¢ÂÂs need and wish for privacy during this time. Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Thompson has been absent from his office for about two months, and had received the cancer diagnosis around August, according to colleagues who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Neither his spokesmen nor several of his friends would disclose what type of cancer Mr. Thompson has. The news of his illness comes three years after he was elected, becoming BrooklynÃ¢ÂÂs first black district attorney. He defeated Charles J. Hynes, an incumbent of more than 20 years who had been weakened by accusations of favoritism toward political supporters in BrooklynÃ¢ÂÂs Orthodox Jewish community, and of allegations of   improprieties. Mr. Thompson, 50, a Democrat, had previously had a successful private law practice he represented Nafissatou Diallo, a Manhattan hotel housekeeper who, in 2011, accused the French politician Dominique   of sexually assaulting her in a case that was eventually dropped by the Manhattan district attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs office. Mr. Thompson had also worked as a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn and delivered a memorable opening argument at the trial of Justin Volpe, a police officer who pleaded guilty in 1999 to torturing a Haitian immigrant, Abner Louima, with a broken broomstick in a Brooklyn station house. Having run on an agenda of reform and racial justice, Mr. Thompson, once in office, earned a reputation as both an advocate for minority communities in a section of the city known for its divisions between black and white residents and, simultaneously, as a tough   officer who concentrated on cracking down on gun crimes and violent street gangs. Brushing aside the resistance of the New York Police Department, he announced in July 2014 that his office would stop prosecuting most   marijuana arrests. He also put in place an amnesty program for people with outstanding warrants. Among his   efforts was the creation of one of the countryÃ¢ÂÂs most robust internal units dedicated to reviewing wrongful convictions, which in the past two years has exonerated 20 defendants. Perhaps the biggest case of his tenure was the prosecution of Peter Liang, a former police officer who was found guilty in February of manslaughter in the shooting of an unarmed black man, Akai Gurley, in the stairwell of a Brooklyn housing project. The shooting, which took place just days before a Staten Island grand jury elected not to indict an officer involved in the choking death of Eric Garner, placed enormous pressure on Mr. Thompson, who had to balance his campaign promises to BrooklynÃ¢ÂÂs black neighborhoods with his close working relationship with the Police Department. Though he did not shy away from mounting an aggressive case against Mr. Liang, after the trial was over Mr. Thompson decided, in Solomonic fashion, to seek no prison time for the former officer, a move that enraged Mr. GurleyÃ¢ÂÂs family and led to bitter protests by   reform activists. One took place early in the morning outside Mr. ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs home in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. For weeks, Mr. ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs illness had been a closely guarded secret, known only to a small circle of friends and associates. On Tuesday, public officials such as Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo issued statements wishing him well. In an email on Tuesday, Douglas H. Wigdor, the   of Mr. ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs private practice, said, Ã¢ÂÂAs KenÃ¢ÂÂs former partner for over 15 years, I have no doubt that he will tackle his illness with the same determination that he has shared with his clients, the people of Brooklyn and, most importantly, his family. Ã¢ÂÂ Another close friend, Arnold N. Kriss, a lawyer who has served as an adviser to Mr. Thompson over the years, said: Ã¢ÂÂKen is doing a remarkable job rebuilding the Brooklyn D. A.Ã¢ÂÂs office. There is no doubt he will successfully continue to fight his illness and, at the same time, fight for the people of Brooklyn.

2021,"For decades, Patricia Lewis toiled as a security guard for NYC Health  Hospitals, a duty she performed along with a second, and sometimes a third, job. Ã¢ÂÂI showered in the hospitals, I slept on gurneys and hardly came home,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Lewis, 68, recalled. All that work was to ensure her childrenÃ¢ÂÂs potential would be realized. Ms. Lewis raised them by herself after a divorce in 1984, motivated by her vow to keep them safe and pay for their college educations. Ã¢ÂÂThese children, I cannot lose them to drugs, I cannot lose them to crime,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂAnd today, my children, all three of them, are successful. But their success, the way the world is, they cannot help me. Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Lewis left her security guard job in 2009, a year and a half after tests showed she had cancer in her left breast. The disease has returned four times since, most recently in August, despite repeated treatments of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery to remove cancerous tissue. Ã¢ÂÂIt takes a whole lot of effort to psych yourself that youÃ¢ÂÂre not going to die,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ms. Lewis must scrape together every dollar to cover medications, hospital bills and other expenses, including rent and groceries. She receives a combined $2, 089 a month from her Social Security and pension payments. Ã¢ÂÂI canÃ¢ÂÂt look to my kids to contribute and help me because they will go under,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. They have homes, responsibilities and children of their own, she said. Ms. LewisÃ¢ÂÂs two sons are police officers, one in Texas and the other in upstate New York. Her daughter is a teacher in New Jersey. Ms. Lewis tries to see them and her nine grandchildren whenever she can. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm fighting the cancer because itÃ¢ÂÂs fighting me,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂI know I want to live. I worked so hard. I want to enjoy my grandkids. Ã¢ÂÂ In 2011, Ms. Lewis contacted Community Health Advocates, a program run by the Community Service Society of New York, one of the organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. It helped Ms. Lewis buy medication at a lower price. This year, she sought its help again. The Community Service Society used $1, 380 in Neediest funds to pay an outstanding medical bill and back rent, and to buy a special mattress that allows Ms. Lewis to elevate her legs and sleep more comfortably. The yearslong fight against cancer has taken a toll on her body, if not her spirit. Her grip is so feeble she requires a neighborÃ¢ÂÂs help to open a can of tomato sauce. Part of a tooth broke off simply chewing a carrot. Even if the cancer goes away, she will need to wear a wig for the rest of her life because her hair has grown back in unsightly patches. Ã¢ÂÂYou never know how cold you are at night until you have no hair,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Lewis said. When it came time to select a wig, she balked at fancier ones because she worried they would make her look like Tina Turner or the Lion King. Ã¢ÂÂI just want something where when my grandkids look at me, IÃ¢ÂÂm still grandma,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. A desire for normalcy sealed her decision not to remove her left breast, especially after doctors told her the cancer could return anyway. She does not care what her reconstructed breast looks like now. Ã¢ÂÂIt looks distorted,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂBut itÃ¢ÂÂs mine. Ã¢ÂÂ She added: Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm not looking for a husband, but I like to go swimming with my kids and grandkids. I want to be normal, as normal as I can be. Ã¢ÂÂ She has covered the walls of her Harlem apartment, which she calls a cage, with photographs of her grandchildren, as well as artwork they have made for her, turning the sterile, austere space into a shrine to her family. Doctors have told Ms. Lewis that after her current radiation treatment, which will run through December, her condition could stabilize for five years. She absorbed the news with skeptical optimism, aware that her health has fluctuated and that she is unlikely to keep living on her own. Ã¢ÂÂEventually IÃ¢ÂÂll be in an assisted living home,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Lewis said. She has already started looking at options. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve made peace with myself with the way IÃ¢ÂÂm going. Ã¢ÂÂ For now, Ms. Lewis, often tired and sick from treatments, leaves her apartment as often as she can. She visits her    mother once or twice a week, attends services at the Ephesus   Adventist Church in Harlem and is a regular at her neighborhoodÃ¢ÂÂs senior center. Ã¢ÂÂI have my bad days,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Lewis said. Ã¢ÂÂBut I have my good days, too. I look at my bad days, the good days overrule. If I stay in this bed, I will surely die. If I get out of this bed, I can make myself do. Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,"As She Fights Cancer, a Woman Strives for Normalcy - The New York Times",2021.0,2021.0,21.0,
2022,"As Chuck Peal lay in a Waterbury, Conn. emergency room one Sunday in early September, doctors furiously tried to make sense of his symptoms. Mr. Peal, 61, appeared to be dying, and they were not sure why. He slipped in and out of consciousness, his blood pressure plummeted, his potassium levels soared and his blood sugar spiked to 10 times the normal level. A doctor suspected a heart attack, but uncertainty left him urgently researching the situation on his phone. This was not a heart attack. Mr. PealÃ¢ÂÂs body was attacking itself, a severe reaction by his immune system that was a side effect of a seemingly miraculous cancer treatment aimed at saving his life. In the seven weeks prior, doctors at Yale had combated Mr. PealÃ¢ÂÂs melanoma with two of the most promising drugs in cancer treatment today. These medicines work by stimulating the immune system to attack cancer as ferociously as it does other threats, like viruses and bacteria. These   immunotherapy drugs have been hailed as a breakthrough in cancer treatment, attracting billions of research dollars and offering new hope to patients out of options. But as their use grows, doctors are finding that they pose serious risks that stem from the very thing that makes them effective. An unleashed immune system can attack healthy, vital organs: notably the bowel, the liver and the lungs, but also the kidneys, the adrenal and pituitary glands, the pancreas and, in rare cases, the heart. Doctors at Yale believe immunotherapy is causing a new type of   diabetes, with at least 17 cases there so far, Mr. PealÃ¢ÂÂs among them. In cancer clinics around the world, and in drug trials, myriad other side effects are showing up. Studies are finding that severe reactions occur nearly 20 percent of the time with certain drugs, and in more than half of patients when some drugs are used in combination. Another recent paper found that 30 percent of patients experienced Ã¢ÂÂinteresting, rare or unexpected side effects,Ã¢ÂÂ with a quarter of the reactions described as severe,   or requiring hospitalization. Some patients have died, including five in recent months in clinical trials of a new immunotherapy drug being tested by Juno Therapeutics Inc. The upshot, oncologists and immunologists say, is that the medical field must be more vigilant as these drugs soar in popularity. And they say more research is needed into who is likely to have reactions and how to treat them. Ã¢ÂÂWe are playing with fire,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. John Timmerman, an oncologist and immunotherapy researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, who recently lost a patient to side effects. The womanÃ¢ÂÂs immunotherapy drugs had successfully Ã¢ÂÂmelted awayÃ¢ÂÂ her cancer, he said, but some weeks later, she got cold and flulike symptoms and died in the emergency room from an inflammatory response that Dr. Timmerman described as Ã¢ÂÂa mass riot, an uprisingÃ¢ÂÂ of her immune system. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂve heard about immunotherapy as GodÃ¢ÂÂs gift, the chosen elixir, the cure for cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂWe havenÃ¢ÂÂt heard much about the collateral damage. Ã¢ÂÂ Despite the warnings, physicians like Dr. Timmerman remain hugely supportive of drugs that are saving the lives of people who would otherwise die. Far better to cope with diabetes, hepatitis or arthritis, the thinking goes, than to die. Most reactions are not nearly so bad and are treatable. The rub, doctors and researchers say, is that the medical system  Ã¢ÂÂ   from   nurses to oncologists to emergency rooms  Ã¢ÂÂ   is too often caught off guard. This is happening for a number of reasons: The drugs are new, so many side effects just have not been seen. Symptoms appear at random, sometimes months after treatment, and can initially seem innocuous. Finally, oncologists are now trying to treat patients with a combination of two or more immunotherapy drugs, hoping for more effective treatment but sometimes getting amplified risks. In the meantime, these drugs are moving from academic centers into cancer clinics across the country, where oncologists in smaller cities most likely have less experience with the side effects. And with lives to be saved and billions of dollars to be made  Ã¢ÂÂ   $250, 000 or more is the list price for a year of some regimens  Ã¢ÂÂ   not enough research has been done into the risks of the new therapies, said William Murphy, a professor of dermatology at the University of California, Davis, who reviews   grants for the government. It is Ã¢ÂÂa massively understudied area,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Murphy said, adding: Ã¢ÂÂThe No. 1 priority is   effects. Everything else, however severe, is considered the price worth paying. Ã¢ÂÂ Caught in the middle are patients like Mr. Peal, whose stories show the delicacy of tinkering with the immune system. It may hold the keys to curing cancer if it can be at once stoked and tamed. Mr. Peal, bespectacled and lean, was dealing with melanoma that had spread to his lungs in June 2015 when he saw a Yale oncologist, Dr. Harriet Kluger. In the past, a patient like him would have been given little chance. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂd sit the patient down and say, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm really sorry, the median life expectancy is nine months. Get your affairs in order,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ said Dr. Kluger, who runs immunotherapy clinical trials focusing on skin and kidney cancer. Now she could offer Mr. Peal hope. Consider: One study   by Dr. Kluger found positive responses in more than 40 percent of advanced melanoma patients when they used a combination of two major immunotherapy drugs, nivolumab and ipilimumab. Other research, however, shows that the promise comes with real risks. A 2015 paper in The New England Journal of Medicine showed that use of these drugs carried a risk of side effects that were severe, required hospitalization or were   54 percent of the time. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs at least that high, at least,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Kluger said. But, she noted, most of the side effects are manageable through immune suppression, such as with steroids. The effectiveness of immunotherapy drugs and their side effects are intimately bound by the same biological mechanisms. Called checkpoint inhibitors, the drugs work by essentially reversing a trick that cancer plays on the immune system: The cancer cells send nefarious signals to   cells that cause them to stand down. Cancer is turning on the immune systemÃ¢ÂÂs brake. There is a valuable reason the brake exists: It can shut down the bodyÃ¢ÂÂs powerful defenders so that they do not inadvertently attack the body itself. Cancer is taking advantage of this key survival mechanism. When an immunotherapy drug turns the brake off, the immune system can sometimes shrink tumors in mere days. Mr. Peal, an engineering technician who tests the performance of helicopter parts, started taking nivolumab and ipilimumab on July 8. Dr. Kluger told him he might feel drowsy or nauseated, or he could get a rash. A rash indeed struck with a vengeance on Aug. 30: red welts from his knees to his waist. On Sept. 1, a Thursday, he visited Dr. KlugerÃ¢ÂÂs office, where he was given a steroid. The next day, he had a fever, nausea and was Ã¢ÂÂdying of thirst  Ã¢ÂÂ   like beyond being in the desert,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. He threw up everything. His girlfriend,   Keating, called Dr. KlugerÃ¢ÂÂs office, and an   doctor prescribed an antinausea drug. Later, Ms. Keating called back to say it was not working, and he was prescribed a second antinausea drug. By Sunday morning, Mr. Peal, unable to move, took an ambulance to the emergency room. In his wallet, he kept an information card published by   Squibb. It lists dozens of risks, including that the therapy Ã¢ÂÂcan cause serious side effects in many parts of your body, which can lead to death. Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. PealÃ¢ÂÂs family told the emergency room doctor about the treatment, Ms. Keating recalled. Ã¢ÂÂThe doctor kept on saying he was on chemotherapy,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂI said, Ã¢ÂÂTheyÃ¢ÂÂre calling it immunotherapy.Ã¢ÂÂ He went on his phone and started looking for information. Ã¢ÂÂ But even Dr. KlugerÃ¢ÂÂs experienced team, which answered the distressed phone calls that weekend, was caught off guard and did not react immediately to the symptoms. Ã¢ÂÂIt took us by surprise. He looked absolutely fine on Friday,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Kluger said. Part of the problem, she thinks, is that Mr. Peal was relatively new to the clinic, and so she and her staff members did not have the experience with him to accurately assess his symptoms. Ã¢ÂÂIt also happened very quickly. It spiraled within hours. Ã¢ÂÂ Ultimately, Mr. Peal spent 24 days in the hospital, where trouble mounted. First his pancreas failed, then his bowels inflamed and his kidneys became dysfunctional, and Ã¢ÂÂto top it off, he has a fever of 103 for which we canÃ¢ÂÂt find a source,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Kluger said in an interview during the crisis. She was trying to figure it out and had emailed other experts around the country to see if they had ever had a patient with this combination of acute immune reactions. No one had seen it before. The pancreas problem was particularly noteworthy. Mr. PealÃ¢ÂÂs is among a growing number of such cases that have led a Yale endocrinologist, Dr. Kevan Herold, an authority on autoimmunity, to conclude that he is seeing a new form of Type 1 diabetes. Typically, the peak age of onset of Type 1 diabetes is 6 to 12, and it involves the immune systemÃ¢ÂÂs destroying, bit by bit, the cells in the pancreas that make the insulin needed to metabolize sugar into energy. But this is different: Patients are 50 or older and are losing insulin production all at once, including in one case of an   . Dr. Herold said he was hearing similar stories from peers around the country. Ã¢ÂÂA single case like this is uncommon,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂAs an aggregate, itÃ¢ÂÂs  . Ã¢ÂÂ Another case at Yale involved Colleen Platt, 65, a real estate agent from Torrington, Conn. who was being treated by Dr. Kluger for   kidney cancer. Ms. Platt opted for a clinical trial involving two immunotherapy drugs, atezolizumab and a second drug that Dr. Kluger declined to name because the trial is continuing. Days after the second treatment in November 2014, Ms. Platt started feeling dizzy and numb and was vomiting water. She went to Dr. KlugerÃ¢ÂÂs office, where they did lab tests that Ã¢ÂÂwere so profoundly abnormal, we thought this was lab error,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Kluger recounted. Ã¢ÂÂWe thought the machine was messed up. Ã¢ÂÂ The tests were right. Like Mr. Peal, Ms. Platt had gone into diabetic ketoacidosis, a condition in which her body, desperate to compensate for energy it was missing when her pancreas shut down, created a flux of acid that could keep her functioning in the short term, at the risk of gravely harming organs throughout her body. Outside the emergency room, while a chaplain visited Ms. Platt to comfort her, Dr. Kluger called the drug company to report the extraordinary reaction. Today, like Mr. Peal, Ms. Platt takes multiple insulin shots each day, and still her sugar level fluctuates wildly. On the other hand, immunotherapy has largely beaten her cancer. In fact, after consulting with other doctors and one of the drug companies, Dr. Kluger recommended Ms. Platt continue with treatment, which she did. Ã¢ÂÂHer pancreas isnÃ¢ÂÂt coming back,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Kluger said, referring to the diabetic effects of immunotherapy. Ã¢ÂÂShe has her life. Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Peal  Ã¢ÂÂ   who, like Ms. Platt, agreed to let Dr. Kluger and Dr. Herold discuss his case  Ã¢ÂÂ   feels the   will be well worth it. In fact, on Friday, he got the results from a scan taken the day before and learned that immunotherapy had eliminated two of his cancer lesions and shrunk two others. Ã¢ÂÂI can deal with diabetes,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, Ã¢ÂÂif I can beat melanoma. Ã¢ÂÂ Evidence of these challenges is decades old. In the   Matthew Krummel, a young immunology graduate student known as Max, worked at a lab at the University of California, Berkeley, that would become one of the most influential in the development of immunotherapy. The lab was run by Dr. James Allison, who, along with Dr. Krummel, published a seminal paper in 1995 showing that they could eliminate tumors in mice by turning off a brake on the immune system. But the lab got less attention for a related experiment: The skin of some mice treated this way turned from black to white. They had lost their pigmentation, a result of the immune systemÃ¢ÂÂs attacking the cells that make melanin. The startling change was not   but indicated the power of tinkering with the immune system. This discovery was novel but not particularly celebrated compared with the promise of curing cancer, Dr. Krummel recalled. The skin study Ã¢ÂÂwas kind of a footnote,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Then came the TeGenero tragedy in 2006. TeGenero Immuno Therapeutics designed a drug to stimulate the immune system to fight leukemia. At Northwick Park Hospital in London, a Phase 1 trial took place, with six healthy patients getting the drug. Within hours, all suffered multiorgan failure. The devastating results tempered the enthusiasm and suggested that more work needed to be done in advance of human trials. But enthusiasm came roaring back. Part of the reason was that, ultimately, the autoimmune reactions were seen not only as an acceptable cost of these drugs but as evidence they were working. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs the nature of the beast,Ã¢ÂÂ said Martin Bachmann, a professor and immunologist at the Jenner Institute, which is affiliated with Oxford University. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm not sure you can get rid of the side effects  Ã¢ÂÂ   itÃ¢ÂÂs really what you want. Ã¢ÂÂ Chemotherapy, too, has side effects, but Dr. Kluger prefers immunotherapyÃ¢ÂÂs   because the drugs may offer enduring control of cancer without the need for continued treatment. So she is joining others looking to address largely unanswered questions: Who is likely to be at risk, can the side effects be recognized before turning dangerous, and how should they be treated? In June, Dr. Kluger and Dr. Herold submitted a grant proposal to the National Institutes of Health to study whether they could predict which patients would develop these symptoms. They based the proposal on a hypothesis that some patients have a biology or a genetic background that might make them more likely to have side effects. The proposal has not yet been funded. Thus far, only a modicum of work has been done on these questions. Several studies found that older mice were more susceptible than younger mice to autoimmune reactions another study, also in mice, found that obese subjects were more likely to have adverse effects. Ã¢ÂÂOld or fat mice were literally dead within hours,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Murphy, the professor at Davis who believes too little is being done. He is well positioned to see the trends: In the past year, he sat on eight government grant review committees focused on immunotherapy, and he said only three out of 500 research proposals he reviewed focused on the toxicity side of immunotherapy. Part of the problem, he said, is that the drug companies that are driving research prefer working with labs that support trialsÃ¢ÂÂ moving quickly. As a result, Dr. Murphy said, human trials are advancing faster than the background research can be done. Hoping to push access to lifesaving drugs, the Food and Drug Administration has a Ã¢ÂÂbreakthrough therapy designationÃ¢ÂÂ that allows faster approval. Since 2012, the agency has granted breakthrough designation about 110 times, almost a quarter of them for immunotherapy. Ã¢ÂÂWhen people talk about moonshots, theyÃ¢ÂÂre talking about curing cancer, but it has to look at the whole picture,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Murphy said. With so much momentum pushing for a cure, the emphasis from researchers and   oncologists is on more vigilance about the side effects. Dr. Timmerman, from U. C. L. A. said he wished he had seen the signs of trouble in his patient, who survived cancer only to die in the emergency room after exhibiting seemingly modest flulike symptoms. Ã¢ÂÂIf we had only known the power we had unleashed that was causing such a toll on her organ system, we might have saved her,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂYou have to manage this hour by hour,Ã¢ÂÂ he added. Ã¢ÂÂMinute by minute.

2023,"Recalling that moment four years ago, when Gertrudis Torres learned she had Stage 3 breast cancer, still causes her breathing to become heavy and tears to well up. The unthinkable diagnosis was another blow to Ms. TorresÃ¢ÂÂs family. Two years before, in 2010, her husband, Pedro Ayala, was told that he had throat cancer. Her first thoughts after receiving the news were about her son and daughter. How could they be left alone if their parents died? Who would care for them? Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs like when youÃ¢ÂÂre playing and somebody grabs ahold of you and you try to move but you canÃ¢ÂÂt,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Torres, 45, said. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs not that you donÃ¢ÂÂt want to. ItÃ¢ÂÂs like somebodyÃ¢ÂÂs holding you. Ã¢ÂÂ In March 2013, she began chemotherapy at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center in the Bronx. In May, after years of treatment, her husband died, leaving Ms. Torres to look after their son, Divian, 16, and their daughter, Yeslly, 11. Ms. Torres said she had even more motivation to beat her disease, even as her substantial grief and her weakened physical strength made the challenge seem impossible at times. Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt think cancer kills the people,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs how they take it. Ã¢ÂÂ During her treatments, she observed other cancer patients whose   faces bore witness to the horrors of the disease. She told herself she would not end up like that. Ã¢ÂÂI know weÃ¢ÂÂre all going to die one day,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Torres said. Ã¢ÂÂBut when they say, Ã¢ÂÂYou have cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ all people think, Ã¢ÂÂYouÃ¢ÂÂre going to die now.Ã¢ÂÂ And the cancer takes them. Ã¢ÂÂ Every day before she went to the hospital for treatment, she dressed up with vigor and excitement, as if going to a fancy dinner or a happening nightclub, donning stylish wigs and makeup. Ã¢ÂÂI would try to be strong,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Torres said. Her cancer has been in remission since 2014, but Ms. Torres stays active to fight off the remaining physical pain. On occasion, she and Divian play basketball at a park in the Bronx. Most mornings, Ms. Torres takes long walks around a running track, a form of meditative exercise. However, tight finances have become an inescapable part of the familyÃ¢ÂÂs life. Ms. Torres has been out of work for years. She left a job as a cashier when her husband fell ill, and it was difficult to return to work when she started her own treatment. The family receives $935 in Social Security disability payments every month. There is no room for extra expenses. In January, Yeslly came home from school with a note asking for $200 to pay her   graduation dues. She attends Community School 61, a ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Aid Society school in the Bronx. The ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Aid Society is one of eight organizations supported by The New York TimesÃ¢ÂÂs Neediest Cases Fund. Unsure how she could afford the $200, Ms. Torres contacted the school for help. The ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Aid Society used $170 in Neediest funds to help. The agency previously assisted the family last December, giving them $300 in gift cards to buy clothing and other necessities. After a caseworker visited the TorresesÃ¢ÂÂ home earlier this year, an additional $900 was used to buy two new beds. Ms. Torres and Yeslly had been sharing a twin bed, while Divian slept on a sofa. The agency also used Neediest funds to buy them a kitchen table. Ã¢ÂÂThank God we got a table,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Torres said. Ã¢ÂÂWe can go to the table and eat together. Pray first, then eat the food. Ã¢ÂÂ In September, the family moved into a bigger apartment in the Bronx. Ms. Torres said she remained optimistic about her health and the familyÃ¢ÂÂs future. She said she hoped her children would attend college. Ms. Torres has career ambitions of her own. She plans to work on getting her high school equivalency diploma, and wants to become a medical assistant, a desire she has had for more than a year. Despite her hardships, and the loss of her husband that still weighs heavily on her and her children, Ms. Torres wakes up each morning thanking God for his blessings. She tells Divian and Yeslly to be grateful for another day of life and that fear has no place in their home. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs all about having a positive Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Torres said. Ã¢ÂÂWhatever you think, thatÃ¢ÂÂs what you attract. Negative attracts negative. Positive attracts positive.

Ã¢ÂÂI want to go back to being who I was,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Manning said on Friday in an interview in his hospital room. Sitting up in a chair, happy to be out of bed for the first time since the operation, he said he felt well and had experienced hardly any pain. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre cautiously optimistic,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Curtis L. Cetrulo, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon and a leader of the surgical team. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs uncharted waters for us. Ã¢ÂÂ The surgery is experimental, part of a research program with the ultimate goal of helping combat veterans with severe pelvic injuries, as well as cancer patients and accident victims. If all goes as planned, normal urination should be possible for Mr. Manning within a few weeks, and sexual function in weeks to months, Dr. Cetrulo said. Mr. Manning welcomed questions and said he wanted to speak out publicly to help dispel the shame and stigma associated with genital cancers and injuries, and to let other men know there was hope of having normal anatomy restored. Ã¢ÂÂDonÃ¢ÂÂt hide behind a rock,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. He said he was not quite ready to take a close look at his transplant. He will have to take several   drugs for the rest of his life. One of them, tacrolimus, seems to speed nerve regeneration and may help restore function to the transplant, Dr. Cetrulo said. Another patient, his penis destroyed by burns in a car accident, will receive a transplant as soon as a matching donor becomes available, Dr. Cetrulo said. Surgeons at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine are also planning to perform penis transplants, and have had a combat veteran, injured in Afghanistan, on the waiting list for several months. Dr. Cetrulo estimated the cost at $50, 000 to $75, 000. Both hospitals are paying for the procedures, and the doctors are donating their time. Worldwide, only two other penis transplants have been reported: a failed one in China in 2006 and a successful one in South Africa in 2014, in which the recipient later fathered a child. Veterans are a major focus of transplant programs in the United States because suicide rates are exceptionally high in soldiers with severe damage to the genitals and urinary tract, Dr. Cetrulo said. Ã¢ÂÂTheyÃ¢ÂÂre   to    guys, and they feel they have no hope of intimacy or a sexual life,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂThey canÃ¢ÂÂt even go to the bathroom standing up. Ã¢ÂÂ Given the psychological toll, he said, a penis transplant can be lifesaving. Dr. Cetrulo said the team would most likely perfect its techniques on civilian patients and then move on to injured veterans. It will also train military surgeons to perform the transplants. The Department of Defense, he said in an email, Ã¢ÂÂdoes not like to have wounded warriors undergo unproven techniques  Ã¢ÂÂ   i. e. they do not want them to be Ã¢ÂÂguinea pigs,Ã¢ÂÂ as they have already sacrificed so much. Ã¢ÂÂ His team is working on ways to minimize or even eliminate the need for   medicines, which transplant patients typically have to take. That research is especially important for veterans, he said, because many are young and will risk serious adverse effects, like cancer and kidney damage, if they have to take the drugs for decades. From 2001 to 2013, 1, 367 men in the military suffered   genitourinary injuries in Iraq or Afghanistan, according to the Department of Defense Trauma Registry. Nearly all were under 35 and had been hurt by homemade bombs, commonly called improvised explosive devices, or I. E. D. s. Some lost part or all of their penises. The Massachusetts General team spent three years preparing for the penis transplants. The team did meticulous dissections in a cadaver lab to map out anatomy, and operated on five or six dead donors to practice removing the tissue needed for the transplants. Mr. ManningÃ¢ÂÂs operation involved about a dozen surgeons and 30 other health care workers. Dr. Dicken Ko, a team leader and the director of the hospitalÃ¢ÂÂs regional urology program, said the team had not planned a set number of transplants. Instead, he said, the hospital will evaluate candidates one at a time and decide whether to allow surgery. For now, he said, the transplants will be limited to cancer and trauma patients, and will not be offered to transgender people. An accident at work in 2012 brought Mr. Manning to the hospital, and ultimately to the transplant team. Heavy equipment had fallen on him, causing severe injuries. The doctors treating him saw an abnormal growth on his penis that he had not noticed. Tests revealed an aggressive and potentially fatal cancer. Penile cancer is rare, with about 2, 030 new cases and 340 deaths expected in the United States this year. If not for the accident, Mr. Manning said, Ã¢ÂÂI wouldÃ¢ÂÂve been in the ground two years ago. Ã¢ÂÂ Doctors said that to save his life, they would have to remove most of his penis, in an operation called a partial penectomy. Mr. ManningÃ¢ÂÂs urologic oncologist, Dr. Adam S. Feldman, estimated that a few hundred men a year needed full or partial penectomies because of cancer. Mr. Manning was left with a stump about an inch long. He had to sit to urinate. Intimacy was out of the picture. He was single and was not involved with anyone when the cancer was found. After the amputation, new relationships were unthinkable. Ã¢ÂÂI wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt go near anybody,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. He continued: Ã¢ÂÂI couldnÃ¢ÂÂt have a relationship with anybody. You canÃ¢ÂÂt tell a woman, Ã¢ÂÂI had a penis amputation. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Some people close to him urged him to keep the operation a secret, but he refused, saying that was like lying, and he had nothing to be ashamed of. Ã¢ÂÂI didnÃ¢ÂÂt advertise, but if people asked, I told them the truth,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, adding that a few male friends made Ã¢ÂÂguy talkÃ¢ÂÂ jokes at his expense, but that it toughened him up. Ã¢ÂÂMen judge their masculinity with their bodies,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Before he had even left the hospital after the amputation, he began asking Dr. Feldman about a transplant. No one at the hospital was considering the idea yet, and Dr. Feldman admits that he thought it was a bit outlandish. But Mr. Manning never gave up hope. Ã¢ÂÂI kept my eye on the prize,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Soon Dr. Cetrulo and Dr. Ko began talking about transplants. About three years later, Dr. Feldman called Mr. Manning to ask if he still wanted the operation. After a battery of medical tests, interviews and psychological grilling  Ã¢ÂÂ   typical for transplant candidates, to make sure they understand the risks and will take   medicine  Ã¢ÂÂ   Mr. Manning was on the waiting list. Two weeks later, a donor with the right blood type and skin tone became available. Mr. Manning was stunned that it had happened so fast. Dr. Cetrulo credits the New England Organ Bank, which asks families of some dying patients to consider organ donation. The organ bank said the donorÃ¢ÂÂs family wished to remain anonymous but had extended a message to Mr. Manning saying they felt blessed and were delighted his recovery was going well. Organ banks do not assume that families who donate internal organs like kidneys and livers will also be willing to give visible or intimate parts like a face, hands or a penis. Those requests are made separately. Several families have agreed to allow the penis to be removed, and none have declined, said Jill Stinebring, the organ bankÃ¢ÂÂs regional director of organ donation services. So far, Mr. Manning has had one serious complication. The day after his surgery, he began to hemorrhage and was rushed back to the operating room. Since then, his recovery has been smoother, he said. He has no regrets. He looks forward to going back to work and hopes to eventually have a love life again. Ã¢ÂÂIf IÃ¢ÂÂm lucky, I get 75 percent of what I used to be,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂBefore the surgery I was 10 percent. But they made no promises. That was part of the deal.

2025,"A diagnosis of breast cancer at age 27 is shattering for anyone. But for Eli Oberman, it came with extra layers of anxiety. He is a transgender man, who was born female but began taking male hormones when he was 19 to change gender. Like many transgender people, Mr. Oberman switched gender without having surgery to change his body. The cancer was a stark reminder that he was still vulnerable to illnesses from his original anatomy  Ã¢ÂÂ   and that the medical world has blind spots in its understanding of how to take care of trans men and women. Ã¢ÂÂI just felt overwhelmed on all levels,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Oberman said. Ã¢ÂÂOverwhelmed about facing the diagnosis, overwhelmed about the irony of it being this part of my body that was already so fraught for me. Ã¢ÂÂ About 1. 4 million adults in the United States report they are transgender, according to a recent analysis of federal and state data. That figure is twice the previous estimate, and as awareness has increased, the health care system has begun scrambling to meet their needs. The government lifted a ban on Medicare coverage for transgender surgery and hormone treatment in 2014, and in 2015 New York State ended a similar ban for Medicaid patients. This year, a rule under the Affordable Care Act banning discrimination in health care specifically included protection for transgender people. Hospitals and professional schools have begun training employees and students on transgender medicine, and on basic etiquette like addressing trans men and women by the name and pronoun they prefer. At the Mount Sinai Health System in New York, which recently opened a Center for Transgender Medicine and Surgery, about 8, 000 employees had such training last year. Ã¢ÂÂWhen I think back to the earlier days and think where we are now, itÃ¢ÂÂs unbelievably better,Ã¢ÂÂ said Barbara E. Warren, a psychologist and the director for L. G. B. T. programs and policies at Mount Sinai. But there are still struggles. Dr. Warren and other experts said it was common for transgender people to avoid screenings and other medical care for parts of their bodies associated with their original gender. If problems do arise, they may find themselves in situations like Mr. Oberman, who suddenly became the lone male patient in waiting rooms full of women, and a target of curiosity or scorn from some health workers. Mr. Oberman, now 33, was treated for the cancer six years ago, but decided just recently to speak about it publicly in hopes of helping to improve care for others. He has big, dark eyes, thinning hair, a warm smile and a leafy tattoo wreathing one arm  Ã¢ÂÂ   the kudzu vine, he said, because it is Ã¢ÂÂso unstoppably alive. Ã¢ÂÂ He lives in Brooklyn, has a degree in poetry and education, and plays violin in a rock band called the Shondes (Ã¢ÂÂDisgraces,Ã¢ÂÂ in Yiddish). His day jobs have included managing a database for a nonprofit organization. He began taking testosterone when he was 19 for its masculinizing effects  Ã¢ÂÂ   these include increased facial and body hair, a lower voice, more muscle and, usually, an end to periods. But he never had surgery to change his body. Many trans people do not, and so many trans men still have ovaries and vaginas, and trans women, prostate glands and penises. Early in his transition, Mr. Oberman wanted Ã¢ÂÂtop surgeryÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   breast removal  Ã¢ÂÂ   but could not afford it, so he wore binders to flatten his chest. Gradually, he became more comfortable with his body and lost interest in the surgery. He first noticed a breast lump in 2010. It was not easy to feel, and cancer at his age just didnÃ¢ÂÂt seem possible. He let six or eight months go by before having scans and a biopsy. Those tests required leaving the safety of his usual clinic, which specialized in L. G. B. T. patients, and plunging into the world of mainstream medicine, where he said doctors treated him with respect, but other workers did not. Ã¢ÂÂI had some horrible experiences,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. During one procedure, when Mr. Oberman had his shirt off, a male technician, seeing that he was transgender, exclaimed: Ã¢ÂÂWhy would you do this to yourself? ItÃ¢ÂÂs disgusting. Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Oberman never reported the episodes. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm not proud to say I didnÃ¢ÂÂt complain,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, adding that he wished he had done so for the sake of other patients. But he was facing a   disease. The cancer was aggressive. He would need both breasts removed, and then chemotherapy. Ã¢ÂÂI felt guilty, able to get free surgery I didnÃ¢ÂÂt want because I had cancer, and so many others want it and canÃ¢ÂÂt get it,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. He soon learned that mastectomies, which remove as much breast tissue as possible, differ from top surgery, which preserves enough to give the chest a   contour. Because he had cancer, top surgery was not a safe option: It would leave too much breast tissue, and too much risk of recurrence. Friends who have had top surgery were stunned to find out they still had a risk of breast cancer because of the tissue left behind, he said. Before surgery, thinking that testosterone might interfere with healing, Mr. ObermanÃ¢ÂÂs doctors advised him to stop taking it for a month. He followed their advice, but soon, he said, Ã¢ÂÂI went insane. I wasnÃ¢ÂÂt rational. I was lying on the floor, crying. Ã¢ÂÂ Back on the hormone, he became himself again. Chemotherapy gave him a Ã¢ÂÂdefinitionless moonface,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, and it coarsened his features and thinned his hair permanently. It had taken him years to feel comfortable in his trans identity, and now, he said, Ã¢ÂÂIt felt like starting all over again. Ã¢ÂÂ He would have liked to join a   support group, but feared he would not be accepted. His reluctance to deal with the health care system has lingered. Just last year, at 32, he finally had his first Pap smear to screen for cervical cancer. It was about 10 years overdue, according to current guidelines. Doctors had nagged him to be tested, and one even threatened to withhold his testosterone unless he complied. He kept putting it off because he feared being treated badly in a gynecologistÃ¢ÂÂs office. Trans friends who had called for appointments were challenged by receptionists who assumed that a deep voice meant they did not belong. Trans men often avoid gynecologists, said Dr. Asa Radix, Mr. ObermanÃ¢ÂÂs physician and the senior director of research and education at the   Community Health Center in New York, which provides health care for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Ã¢ÂÂImagine, if youÃ¢ÂÂre a   trans man, and youÃ¢ÂÂre going to the gynecologist,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Radix said. Ã¢ÂÂYou go to the front desk, and you have to out yourself. Everyone can hear whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on. You just want to run out the door. Ã¢ÂÂ In addition, some trans people are conflicted about their bodies, Ã¢ÂÂand may not want to think they have the anatomy they have,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Radix said. He added that pelvic exams could be physically uncomfortable for a transgender man because testosterone can dry out vaginal tissue. It can also change the cervix in ways that make a Pap test hard to read, necessitating a second round. Mr. Oberman said that in Ã¢ÂÂmoments of dark paranoia,Ã¢ÂÂ he wondered if taking testosterone might have caused his cancer  Ã¢ÂÂ   or if it was unrelated and the tumor might have developed anyway. His mother and her mother had both had breast cancer  Ã¢ÂÂ   though well after menopause. There is no evidence that trans men or women who take hormones have increased risks of any type of cancer, Dr. Radix said. Studies in Europe have found no increased risk, but it is not clear that the results apply to the United States, where the population is less homogeneous and many transgender people obtain hormones via the internet or other sources outside the health care system. Zil Goldstein, a nurse practitioner and program director at Mount SinaiÃ¢ÂÂs transgender center, said that while she had concerns about the   safety of transgender hormones, she worried more about the possible harm from not prescribing them  Ã¢ÂÂ   researchers report that 41 percent of transgender people attempt suicide. The hormone question concerns Mr. ObermanÃ¢ÂÂs oncologist, Dr. Paula Klein, who specializes in breast cancer at Mount Sinai Beth Israel (not the same hospital where he had his biopsies and surgery). She said trans men with breast cancer were often urged to stop taking testosterone. One reason is that the body converts some testosterone to estrogen, which can speed the growth of many breast tumors. And some breast cancers may also be stimulated by testosterone, she said. But there is no solid data to guide trans patients, and Mr. Oberman does not want to stop taking the hormone. Dr. Klein was an author of a journal article in 2011 about two other trans men with breast cancer. Both took testosterone and, like Mr. Oberman, chose to stay on it. Few other cases have been reported. Dr. Klein has been suggesting that Mr. Oberman have his ovaries removed. Part of her reasoning was that he had stopped taking tamoxifen, a drug commonly prescribed to prevent breast cancer recurrence. Taking out the ovaries would mean lower estrogen levels, which would help prevent a recurrence of breast cancer. Ã¢ÂÂYou would definitely benefit,Ã¢ÂÂ she said during an office visit in September. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs a slam dunk for someone like you, taking away all your female parts,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Klein said, adding: Ã¢ÂÂWe thought youÃ¢ÂÂd eat that up. A transgender gift. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂExcept I donÃ¢ÂÂt want it,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Oberman said. He did not want more surgery or the hormonal jolt that removing his ovaries would bring. He thought the mastectomies and chemotherapy had very likely cured him. Dr. Klein backed off, saying, Ã¢ÂÂLook, the odds are that youÃ¢ÂÂre going to be fine. Ã¢ÂÂ He hugged her on the way out. It seemed likely that they would have this conversation again.",cancer,"Living as a Man, Fighting Breast Cancer: How Trans People Face Care Gaps - The New York Times",2025.0,2025.0,25.0,
2026,"Some of the most promising advances in cancer research in recent years involve treatments known as immunotherapy. These advances are spurring billions of dollars in investment by drug companies, and are leading to hundreds of clinical trials. Here are answers to some basic questions about this complex and rapidly evolving field. Immunotherapy refers to any treatment that uses the immune system to fight diseases, including cancer. Unlike chemotherapy, which kills cancer cells, immunotherapy acts on the cells of the immune system, to help them attack the cancer. Drugs called checkpoint inhibitors are the most widely used form of immunotherapy for cancer. They block a mechanism that cancer cells use to shut down the immune system. This frees killer    Ã¢ÂÂ   a critically important part of the immune system  Ã¢ÂÂ   to attack the tumor. Four checkpoint inhibitors have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and are on the market. They are given intravenously. Another form of immunotherapy, called cell therapy, involves removing immune cells from the patient, altering them genetically to help them fight cancer, then multiplying them in the laboratory and dripping them, like a transfusion, back into the patient. This type of treatment is manufactured individually for each patient, and is still experimental. Bispecific antibodies are an alternative to cell therapy, one that does not require individualizing treatment for each patient. These antibodies are proteins that can attach to both a cancer cell and a   that way bringing them close together so the   can attack the cancer. One such drug, called Blincyto, has been approved to treat a rare type of leukemia. Vaccines, another form of immunotherapy, have had considerably less success than the others. Unlike childhood vaccines, which are aimed at preventing diseases like measles and mumps, cancer vaccines are aimed at treating the disease once the person has it. The idea is to prompt the immune system to attack the cancer by presenting it with some piece of the cancer. The only vaccine approved specifically to treat cancer in the United States is Provenge, for prostate cancer. Another vaccine, BCG, which was developed to prevent tuberculosis, has long been used to treat bladder cancer. As a weakened TB bacterium, BCG appears to provoke a general immune system reaction that then works against the cancer. Researchers hope that other vaccines may yet be made to work by combining them with checkpoint inhibitors. Checkpoint inhibitors have been approved to treat advanced melanoma, HodgkinÃ¢ÂÂs lymphoma and cancers of the lung, kidney, bladder and head and neck. The drugs are being tested in many other types of cancer. So far, cell therapy has been used mostly for blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma. The four on the market are: Yervoy (ipilimumab) and Opdivo (nivolumab) made by   Squibb Keytruda (pembrolizumab) by Merck and Tecentriq (atezolizumab) by Genentech. Though immunotherapy has been stunningly successful in some cases, it still works in only a minority of patients. Generally, 20 percent to 40 percent of patients are helped by checkpoint inhibitors  Ã¢ÂÂ   although the rate can be higher among those with melanoma. Some patients with advanced disease have had remissions that have lasted for years. In some cases, combining two checkpoint inhibitors increases the effectiveness. But for some people the drugs do not work at all, or they help just temporarily. Cell therapy can produce complete remissions in 25 percent to 90 percent of patients with lymphoma or leukemia, depending on the type of cancer. In some cases the remissions can last for years, but in others relapses occur within a year. Checkpoint inhibitors can cause severe problems that are, essentially, autoimmune illnesses, in which the immune system attacks healthy tissue as well as cancer. One result is inflammation. In the lungs it can cause breathing trouble in the intestine it can cause diarrhea. Joint and muscle pain, and rheumatoid arthritis can also occur, and the immune system can also attack vital glands like the thyroid and pituitary. In rare cases, the immune system can attack the heart, especially when patients take two checkpoint inhibitors at the same time. These reactions are dangerous, but can often be controlled with steroid medicines like prednisone and other   drugs. Cell therapy can also lead to severe and potentially fatal reactions resulting from the overstimulation of the immune system. The reactions can usually be controlled, but patients may need to be treated in an intensive care unit. Checkpoint inhibitors can cost $150, 000 a year. Many insurers will pay if the drug has been approved for the type of cancer the patient has. But sometimes there are high  . Patients in clinical trials may get the drugs free. Manufacturers have not said yet how much they will charge for cell therapies, assuming they win approval and reach the market. But experts expect the price to be as high as a few hundred thousand dollars. Any oncologist can prescribe the checkpoint inhibitors that are on the market. Patients with cancers for which the drugs have not been approved may find insurers reluctant to pay, but may be able to get the drugs for free by volunteering for clinical trials. Cell therapies are available only through clinical trials now. Most of the study sites are major medical centers. Information is available on the Cancer Research Institute website, or by calling     (Monday through Friday, 8:30 a. m. to 6 p. m. E. T.).

2031,"UKIP leader Paul Nuttall has used a landmark speech to brand Islamist extremism a Ã¢ÂÂcancer within our societyÃ¢ÂÂ proposing a range of robust actions to ensure it is Ã¢ÂÂcut outÃ¢ÂÂ. [The Liverpudlian MEP described how, in the past, the police and MI5 had Ã¢ÂÂfoiled plot after plot in the nick of timeÃ¢ÂÂ but are now Ã¢ÂÂbeing overwhelmed by the impossible scaleÃ¢ÂÂ of the problem.  He criticised an establishment which has been complacent in allowing Islamists to Ã¢ÂÂset up home in BritainÃ¢ÂÂ since the 1980s, on the mistaken assumption that they would not attack the country which had given them shelter. Nuttall also singled out particular actions undertaken by Theresa May in her former role as Home Secretary for denunciation, such as the massive police cuts carried out at the behest of former Chancellor of the Exchequer Geroge Osborne, and the abolition of control orders in favour of weaker TPims at the behest of former Deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg.

Ã¢ÂÂ   Andrew Scattergood (@AJScattergood) May 24, 2017,  Nuttall also condemned the establishmentÃ¢ÂÂs tendency to Ã¢ÂÂwhip up cries of racismÃ¢ÂÂ against individuals and group who attempted to raise the alarm against the growing threat posed by mass immigration and the promotion of multiculturalism over integration, as well as failure to openly acknowledge the problem. Ã¢ÂÂFor far too long politicians in this country have lacked the courage to name the source of terror in our midst,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂIt is Islamist extremism. Ã¢ÂÂ He described how he was Ã¢ÂÂcondemnedÃ¢ÂÂ by   opposition chiefs from Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens, and the Scottish and Welsh separatist parties as recently as the June 1st general election debate in Cambridge. Ã¢ÂÂIslamist extremism is a cancer within our society,Ã¢ÂÂ Nuttall repeated Tuesday, appearing to feel vindicated by the recent attacks in London.

Ã¢ÂÂ   Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 6, 2017,  Nuttall pledged to rapidly reverse the cuts to police numbers, estimating that it would cost ÃÂ£1. 2 billion to replace the 20, 000 constables who have been lost since the Tories returned to power in 2010. Ã¢ÂÂIn these times of terror we need more bobbies on the beat,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, emphasising the importance of the ordinary community policing which the Police Federation claima has Ã¢ÂÂcollapsedÃ¢ÂÂ in recent years, causing local intelligence to Ã¢ÂÂdry upÃ¢ÂÂ. Nuttall also pledged to tackle the Ã¢ÂÂrampant radicalisation within our prisonsÃ¢ÂÂ by reversing cuts to prison funding and officer numbers, and to train 4, 000 new border guards to Ã¢ÂÂproperly control our bordersÃ¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ   which experts now believe to be Ã¢ÂÂporousÃ¢ÂÂ particularly along the coast. Asked how he would fund these changes, along with a Ã¢ÂÂmajor increase in resources for MI5Ã¢ÂÂ the UKIP leader pointed to ÃÂ£35 billion in savings identified in his partyÃ¢ÂÂs manifesto, mainly from reducing the ballooning foreign aid budget, cutting the controversial High Speed Rail 2 project, and changing the Barnett formula  Ã¢ÂÂ   described as a Ã¢ÂÂterrible mistakeÃ¢ÂÂ by its late creator  Ã¢ÂÂ   which sees Scotland receive higher levels of funding than elsewhere in Britain.

Nuttall suggested the time has come to accept we now live in different times and pointed out that in Brussels and Strasbourg, where his work as an MEP takes him regularly, armed police are a commonplace sight.

Ã¢ÂÂ   Fox Nation (@foxnation) June 4, 2017,  Nuttall also echoed Colonel Richard Kemp, a former COBRA committee member and commander of British forces in Afghanistan, in calling for Islamic State volunteers holding British nationality to have their Ã¢ÂÂpassport revoked [and] their citizenship removedÃ¢ÂÂ ensuring they Ã¢ÂÂnever be allowed to return to this countryÃ¢ÂÂ. He said he would Ã¢ÂÂmake no apologies for taking nothing off the table to ensure our people are kept safeÃ¢ÂÂ. However, he stopped short of joining Colonel Kemp in calling for foreign nationals on the terror watch list to be deported or interned, and ruled out following U. S. President Donald TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs lead in attempting to impose restrictions on travel to and from failed states such as Libya and Syria, which have become major hotbeds of Islamic radicalism.

He also accused the Labour Party of being Ã¢ÂÂculpableÃ¢ÂÂ in thwarting efforts to counter extremism by opposing Prevent, singling out Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham for his opposition to the programme in particular. The UKIP leader also demanded the Government Ã¢ÂÂclose down mosques where extreme Wahhabi or Salafist versions of Islam are preachedÃ¢ÂÂ and to bar the funding of religious institutions in Britain by Saudi Arabia and Qatar the latter of which was recently isolated by key Arab nations for its alleged support for overseas extremism. Nuttall also urged officials to release the findings of an investigation into Saudi funding of British religious institutions in particular, which are reportedly being suppressed.

Corbyn, he alleged, had Ã¢ÂÂgone out of [his] way to befriend terror groups both in Northern Ireland and the Middle EastÃ¢ÂÂ throughout his political career.

2033,"DonÃ¢ÂÂt eat burnt toast or fish Ã¢ÂÂnÃ¢ÂÂ chips or over crispy roast potatoes  Ã¢ÂÂ   or you may end up getting cancer, a UK government agency has warned. [According to the   warning by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) issued today in a campaign launched on its website, these foods should be avoided because they all contain higher levels of acrylamide, a chemical which has caused cancer in mice.  The campaign  Ã¢ÂÂ   called Go For Gold  Ã¢ÂÂ   says that acrylamide is produced when starchy foods such as bread and potatoes are cooked for long periods at higher temperatures such as baking, frying, grilling, toasting, and roasting. The FSA claims: The scientific consensus is that acrylamide has the potential to cause cancer in humans. Which, according to its critics, is precisely the kind of      junk science which gives      junk science a bad name. As Christopher Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the Institute of Economic Affairs says, this is a classic case of Ã¢ÂÂmission creepÃ¢ÂÂ from a government agency. Ã¢ÂÂThey should be dealing with real safety issues like the handful of restaurants who are putting out genuinely dangerous food,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂThis sort of thing undermines public faith in scientific advice and terrifies people. Ã¢ÂÂPeople just donÃ¢ÂÂt know what to eat anymore because theyÃ¢ÂÂre not being given clear advice. Ã¢ÂÂ Indeed. Neither Cancer Research UK nor the European Food Standards Agency have been able to find a major health risk issue, despite their best efforts. The quango was set up in 2000 under Tony Blair in response to a spate of food poisonings in restaurants. Few would argue that ensuring basic standards of hygiene and safety in the food supply is a legitimate public health goal, but the FSA soon got bored of that and became part of the nanny state. Amongst its dubious achievements are telling football fans to substitute sparkling water and grapes for beer and crisps when watching the World Cup, defining cheese as Ã¢ÂÂjunk foodÃ¢ÂÂ and lobbying for bans on advertising. It is a classic example of bureaucratic expansion. As its mission crept, its budget grew, and although it has been trimmed somewhat in the era of   austerity its annual income exceeds ÃÂ£130 million and it apparently still has time to tell people not to fluff their roast potatoes.",cancer,Nanny State Health Warning: Burnt Toast Can Give You Cancer - Breitbart,2033.0,2033.0,33.0,

2036,"Former NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, author of A Lucky Life Interrupted, the story of his personal journey dealing with a multiple myeloma diagnosis, told Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon that cancer Ã¢ÂÂis the most pernicious enemy that medicine has. Ã¢ÂÂ[In studio at Sirius XMÃ¢ÂÂs broadcasting headquarters in New York City Thursday, Brokaw shared with Breitbart News Daily host Bannon his reaction the day he received the devastating news he had been diagnosed with the incurable but treatable form of cancer in 2013.  Ã¢ÂÂIn the book our hero is Brokaw 2640,Ã¢ÂÂ Bannon said. Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs a mantra thatÃ¢ÂÂs throughout the books. And itÃ¢ÂÂs different from the other books [youÃ¢ÂÂve written]. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not a guy jumping into planes, going into war zones, seeing the Berlin Wall, itÃ¢ÂÂs a very different character. It starts at a board meeting in Rochester, Minnesota. You go out there to have a board meeting. YouÃ¢ÂÂve got a sore back. . . But something happens out there. The hero of this book becomes Brokaw 2640,Ã¢ÂÂ Bannon added. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm not sure I was the hero,Ã¢ÂÂ Brokaw said. Ã¢ÂÂI had a summer long, very persistent backache,Ã¢ÂÂ he explained. Ã¢ÂÂOrthopedists who looked at it also looked at your lifestyle. I had been biking across South America, I went bird hunting in Africa, I was fishing in Montana, but it wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt go away. So my primary care physician at the Mayo Clinic, who was an internist really said it shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt last this long. So he drew some blood early on a Thursday morning and said later in the morning come on over to my office, IÃ¢ÂÂve got another person whoÃ¢ÂÂs going to be there with us. Turned out he was a renowned oncologist, a cancer expert. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂI still didnÃ¢ÂÂt know what was going on,Ã¢ÂÂ Brokaw told Bannon. Ã¢ÂÂHe finished doing that, turned to me and said Ã¢ÂÂYou have a malignancy.Ã¢ÂÂ These were his words. Ã¢ÂÂYou have something called multiple myeloma. You know people who have died from this. Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman to run for   had a multiple myeloma. So did Frank Reynolds, the ABC Anchorman.Ã¢ÂÂ I remember thinking at that moment, my God, thatÃ¢ÂÂs what Frank died of,Ã¢ÂÂ the veteran broadcaster with fifty years at NBC News said. Frank Reynolds   ABCÃ¢ÂÂs World News Tonight from 1978 until his death in 1983. Ã¢ÂÂI had talked to [Reynolds] a week before, and it was very mysterious at the time,Ã¢ÂÂ Brokaw noted. Ã¢ÂÂI was unbelievably calm,Ã¢ÂÂ he said of his own reaction to the news of his diagnosis. Ã¢ÂÂI had always wondered how you would react to that kind of diagnosis. I didnÃ¢ÂÂt know anything about this cancer. And I looked at him and I said, Ã¢ÂÂHow long do I have?Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂAnd he said, Ã¢ÂÂWell, statistically five years. But youÃ¢ÂÂre in good shape, and weÃ¢ÂÂre making a lot of progress. I think we can beat that. I want to run some more tests.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂIt was   Ã¢ÂÂ¦     unreality is the only way to describe it. I was kind of two people. In my body I had a cancer growing. In my head, I was looking at it as if from a distance,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂThis canÃ¢ÂÂt be happening to me. ItÃ¢ÂÂs an abstract of some kind. I was a journalist. I was working the turf, so to speak, asking a lot of questions. Walked out of there was really of two minds. IÃ¢ÂÂve got work to do on the JFK documentary   Ã¢ÂÂ¦     but IÃ¢ÂÂve got cancer. Good Lord. What does that mean?Ã¢ÂÂ Brokaw said. Ã¢ÂÂI typed into the iPad multiple Ã¢ÂÂmyeloma.Ã¢ÂÂ What I found is that it happens to men in my age group. It is a pernicious cancer. It is incurable at this point but highly treatable. It enters bone marrow, and that was the reason I had the backache. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThat was the beginning of a journey that continues. I arrived here this morning on chemotherapy. I got up and took a pill,Ã¢ÂÂ he added. Ã¢ÂÂThis book, A Lucky Life Interrupted, this is a pretty tough journey,Ã¢ÂÂ Bannon told Brokaw. Ã¢ÂÂThis is a very tough process. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂIt was a lot harder than I thought it was going to be, quite honestly,Ã¢ÂÂ Brokaw acknowledged. Ã¢ÂÂWithin three days I was back in Montana in excruciating bone pain, couldnÃ¢ÂÂt get out of bed by the following week. They throw everything at me in terms of pain killers. Finally, I had to be medevaced from Montana back to [the Mayo Clinic in] Rochester [Minnesota]. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂI woke up the next day thinking this is going to get better, but itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be a long haul. That was the reality check for me,Ã¢ÂÂ he added. Ã¢ÂÂI think the first that happens   Ã¢ÂÂ¦     is youÃ¢ÂÂve got to come to grips emotionally and mentally with the consequences of it, and that should become the   object of your life  Ã¢ÂÂ   deal with cancer. Ã¢ÂÂ Brokaw said that when he was first diagnosed, he did not share the news with many beyond a tight circle that included two of his bosses at NBC, his immediate family, and Ã¢ÂÂone or two very close friends. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂI didnÃ¢ÂÂt want to show up on the internet, Ã¢ÂÂTom Brokaw, Cancer Victim.Ã¢ÂÂ These days if you have a slight public profile, which I do, you show up in all the sites quickly, whatever you do. If you run a stop sign, suddenly youÃ¢ÂÂre all over the internet. I didnÃ¢ÂÂt want people to look at me with a kind of sense of pity or wondering what was going to happen to me,Ã¢ÂÂ Brokaw noted. After Christmas 2013, the year of his diagnosis, Ã¢ÂÂpeople began to say to me, Ã¢ÂÂTom, whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on? Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ he said, and eventually, he decided to go public with his journey, first with interviews, then with his 2015 book. Ã¢ÂÂMostly itÃ¢ÂÂs a head game,Ã¢ÂÂ Brokaw said. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve got cancer. I would wake up every morning and think Ã¢ÂÂMy God, IÃ¢ÂÂve got cancer.Ã¢ÂÂ That would become the scrim through which I would see life  Ã¢ÂÂ¦     It would take over my thinking. I would wake up at night, and for just a heartbeat, think everything was okay, and then it would kick in. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂBut what you canÃ¢ÂÂt do,Ã¢ÂÂ Brokaw added, Ã¢ÂÂis surrender to the paranoia of cancer. I mean, you can really take it out to the worst possible consequences. This is a terminal disease after all. It is untreatable. It did have a   life span. I never succumbed to that. I thought, Ã¢ÂÂweÃ¢ÂÂre going to beat thisÃ¢ÂÂ in some fashion. Ã¢ÂÂ Brokaw s that his family members  Ã¢ÂÂ   his wife, and in particular his oldest daughter, a physician who became his Ã¢ÂÂombudsmanÃ¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ   were his greatest resource in dealing with the cancer. Ã¢ÂÂI never lost my temper. IÃ¢ÂÂve got a fairly discharge when it comes to temper. But I thought, thatÃ¢ÂÂs not going to do me any good. IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to get angry at the fact that I have cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂI think the world is divided in two parts: those who have cancer and those who do not. Those who donÃ¢ÂÂt have cancer can be sympathetic, they can be shocked by the loss of a friend, but then they move on. If you have cancer, and itÃ¢ÂÂs in your family, then youÃ¢ÂÂre empathetic, and it never goes away. ItÃ¢ÂÂs  . Even though I didnÃ¢ÂÂt think I was going to die, I knew that we had to treat this successfully,Ã¢ÂÂ Brokaw explained. Ã¢ÂÂHow bad is the pain, and how bad is it to come to grips that the pain is not going to go away, itÃ¢ÂÂs every day?Ã¢ÂÂ Bannon asked. Ã¢ÂÂThe pain was piercing because it was in my spine among other things, and I ended up having to have spinal repair, I had four compression fractures in my spine. ItÃ¢ÂÂs hard to describe. It became all encompassing. Ã¢ÂÂOn the other hand, had been in war zones a lot, and I had flown out on medivac planes, and I had seen young men terribly, terribly damaged. I would always think about them. What IÃ¢ÂÂm going through is tough, but itÃ¢ÂÂs nothing compared to that. I still have all my body parts. IÃ¢ÂÂve got the best care you could possibly get, and IÃ¢ÂÂm just going to get through this,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂToday 1, 600 people will die in America of cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ Brokaw explained. Ã¢ÂÂThis is a part of American life. WeÃ¢ÂÂve made great progress in lung cancer, for example, because of the   campaign. WeÃ¢ÂÂve made great progress in heart disease because weÃ¢ÂÂve changed our diets. Cancer still is an inbred evil in our bodies.

2037,"HOUSTON, March 10 (UPI)  Ã¢ÂÂ   Eating too many carbohydrates such as potatoes, bagels or cereal increases the risk for lung cancer, especially among people who have never smoked, according to a recent study. [A high glycemic index, a measure of the effect of carbohydrates on blood sugar levels, was linked to a greater chance for developing lung cancer, researchers at the University of Texas MD Andersen Cancer Center found.  Lung cancer is the second most common form of cancer in men and women and is most commonly associated with smoking cigarettes. Previous research has shown that eating a lot of red meat, saturated fats and dairy can increase risk for the disease, however carbohydrates have not previously been associated with it. While increased levels of carbohydrates can increase the risk, the researchers said the quality of carbohydrates, rather than the quantity, has the strongest effect. Foods such as white bread and puffed rice cereal are highly refined, which is why the researchers suggest swapping them out for   or pumpernickel breads and pasta. Ã¢ÂÂThe results from this study suggest that, besides maintaining healthy lifestyles, such as avoiding tobacco, limiting alcohol consumption and being physically active, reducing the consumption of foods and beverages with high glycemic index may serve as a means to lower the risk of lung cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Xifeng Wu, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Texas, said in a press release. For the study, published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, the researchers assessed 1, 905 newly diagnosed lung cancer patients, comparing their diets, glycemic index, glycemic load and lung cancer risk with 2, 413 healthy people. The researchers found a 49 percent increased risk of lung cancer among participants with the highest daily glycemic index, compared to those with the lowest. The strongest link between a high glycemic index and lung cancer was among people who never smoked, who were diagnosed with squamous cell carcinomas, and those with less than 12 years of education. Glycemic load, or the amount of carbohydrates a person consumes, was not linked to lung cancer risk, the researchers reported. Among smokers, a high glycemic index was shown to increase risk by 31 percent, though the researchers said the much more significant risk factor lowers the potential   effect. Study participants with more than 12 years of education saw their risk increase by 33 percent, compared to a 77 percent increase for those with less than 12 years. Education level is a proxy for socioeconomic status, which can indicate a lower quality diet and increased likelihood for smoking. Although the researchers say the study did not consider diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease when calculating risk, and their results could be tainted by participants faulty memory of what they ate, they said moderating diet may lower risk for cancer, in addition to other chronic conditions that contribute to cancer.",cancer,Carbohydrates Linked to Increased Risk for Lung Cancer - Breitbart,2037.0,2037.0,37.0,

2039,"The Middle East Media Research Institute brings us the latest fiery rant from Jamaican Sheikh Abdullah   who claims infidels are putting cancer into fake Ã¢ÂÂzamzamÃ¢ÂÂ sacred water and selling it to Muslims.[  After declaring that Ã¢ÂÂevery Catholic is a liar and a hypocrite, and every hypocrite is a Catholic,Ã¢ÂÂ Faisal explained the kuffar (infidels) Ã¢ÂÂput zamzam in bottles, and sell it to Muslims. And itÃ¢ÂÂs fake zamzam, not real. And they put cancer in the water, and many, many Muslims die from cancer, something you do not know. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂFake zamzam, and they put cancer in it,Ã¢ÂÂ he repeated. Ã¢ÂÂAnd people buy it and drink it, and many, many Muslims die from cancer by drinking fake zamzam. So when you buy from the kuffar your fake zamzam, you are going to die from cancer. Many people, many Muslims die from cancer by drinking fake zamzam water. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂZamzamÃ¢ÂÂ is the name of a well in Mecca, whose water is considered sacred to Muslims. However, the actual water from this well is toxic. The BBC noted in 2011 that Ã¢ÂÂsamples from the source suggested it held dangerous chemicals,Ã¢ÂÂ particularly arsenic and nitrate, along with harmful bacteria. The BBC explained that commercial export of the water is forbidden under Saudi law, but tourists are allowed to bring back small amounts of it, after making the pilgrimage to Mecca. Nevertheless, investigators found Ã¢ÂÂlarge quantitiesÃ¢ÂÂ of bottled zamzam water for sale in east and south London, and in Luton. Public health officials tested it and recommended against drinking it because the arsenic levels exceeded healthy limits. Water taken from authentic Zamzam Well taps in Mecca was tested and found to be comparable to the illegal water on sale in the UK. Unfortunately, the Saudi government was seen as reluctant to advise against drinking zamzam water because the notion of the sacred well being unhealthy would anger Muslims. The shops in London apparently did remove the water from their shelves after the British governmentÃ¢ÂÂs health warning. Faisal is, essentially, arguing that actual zamzam water is fine, and the tainted water is fake, deliberately infused with carcinogens by infidels to kill Muslims. This might sound dangerously plausible to Muslims who remain convinced authentic water from the Zamzam Well conveys amazing health and spiritual benefits and is, in fact, the purest water on Earth, certified as such by the Prophet Mohammed. A BBC profile of Sheikh Faisal notes that he was born a Christian under the name Trevor William Forrest to Salvation Army officers in Jamaica, but he converted to Islam after spending several years in Saudi Arabia. He moved to the United Kingdom, where he was jailed for soliciting the murder of Jews and Hindus in 2003 and was seen as an influence on the July 7 London suicide bombers and Ã¢ÂÂshoe bomberÃ¢ÂÂ Richard Reid. He was deported back to Jamaica in 2007. Tapes of his sermons have proven distressingly popular in some circles. He preaches jihad in many of them, including a sermon cited by the BBC where he explained nuclear weapons should only be used against countries which are Ã¢ÂÂ100 percent unbelievers. Ã¢ÂÂ A 2015 article in the UK Mirror accused Faisal of recruiting jihadis for ISIS, noting he is Ã¢ÂÂbroadcasting almost daily online rants to thousands of followers, including many Brits.

2043,"Wielding coat hangers, a coalition of sixty abortion rights groups organized a rally in Warsaw, Poland, over the weekend to protest a proposed law that would further restrict legal abortions in the country. [One of the protesters, Anna Jakobic, said that the right to an abortion must be defended, especially if one has a baby with disabilities. Ã¢ÂÂNo government can decide this. Maybe they also want to prohibit oncological operations? Cancer is also live tissue,Ã¢ÂÂ she said.  PolandÃ¢ÂÂs current legislation, dating back to 1993, bans abortions except when the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest, poses a Ã¢ÂÂhealth riskÃ¢ÂÂ to the mother, or if the fetus bears an anomaly, such as Down Syndrome. The Prenatal Life Protection Law, backed by the prime minister, Beata SzydÃÂo, would ban abortion outright. The new bill, which has been submitted to the Polish parliament, acknowledges that rape is an evil act, but prohibits Ã¢ÂÂpunishing the childÃ¢ÂÂ for the crimes of the rapist. According to opponents, the Law and Justice party (PiS) which was voted into office last October, carries Ã¢ÂÂan agenda of nationalist conservatism, Euroscepticism and Catholic propaganda. Ã¢ÂÂ Abortion activists reportedly organized Ã¢ÂÂsolidarity protestsÃ¢ÂÂ in several other European cities as well, and a few hundred people demonstrated in front of the Polish embassy in London, shouting Ã¢ÂÂmy body, my choice. Ã¢ÂÂ The weekend demonstrations underscored the tremendous impact that the American abortion lobby has had on Polish society and the abortion debate in particular. It was the American feminist Ann Snitow who first brought modern abortion technology to Poland in the early 1990s. The use of coat hanger imagery by protesters was also imported into Europe by U. S.   groups as a symbol of illegal, Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ abortions. Ã¢ÂÂThe thing is, I donÃ¢ÂÂt think women in Poland ever used hangers. I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs strictly American,Ã¢ÂÂ said Polish abortion activist and researcher Agata CheÃÂstowska. At the annual meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of Women in March, the head of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) suggested said that being   really means being  . Ã¢ÂÂWe care about the womanÃ¢ÂÂs life, and the child whoÃ¢ÂÂs coming Ã¢ÂÂ  if they are sick, like Zika, what we are hearing Ã¢ÂÂ  or thrown on the streets, or kidnapped, or dead. We want all alive, and healthy, and productive, and equal to all humanity. We dare to talk about abortion,Ã¢ÂÂ said IPPF President Tewodros Melesse during the New York event. Meanwhile, the European Parliament will vote on Wednesday on a motion that accuses Polish authorities of undermining Ã¢ÂÂconstitutional democracy. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂRecent events in Poland,Ã¢ÂÂ the text reads, Ã¢ÂÂhave given rise to concerns regarding the ability of the Constitutional Court to uphold the constitution and guarantee the respect for the rule of law.

[The    Meet the Parents star told Stern he was diagnosed with an Ã¢ÂÂintermediately aggressiveÃ¢ÂÂ form of the illness in 2014, when he was 48 years old, and that the news had come Ã¢ÂÂout of the blue. Ã¢ÂÂ  Stiller appeared on Howard SternÃ¢ÂÂs SiriusXM radio show alongside his surgeon, Dr. Edward Schaeffer, who had conducted a Ã¢ÂÂrobotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomyÃ¢ÂÂ to successfully remove the actorÃ¢ÂÂs tumor.

Ã¢ÂÂI knew all about self exams,Ã¢ÂÂ Chieze wrote on Facebook last week, Ã¢ÂÂbut a picture of what to look for keyed me into knowing I had a terminal disease.Ã¢ÂÂ In telling her story, she found a similar photo online, an egg carton filled with lemons, on the website for a charity called Worldwide Breast Cancer. She shared it on Facebook with an impassioned call to promote awareness with useful, practical information.  Her post with the    image has now been shared nearly 42, 000 times. When life gives you lemons, Corrine Ellsworth Beaumont, who launched the Ã¢ÂÂKnow Your LemonsÃ¢ÂÂ campaign and founded Worldwide Breast Cancer in 2014, lost both of her grandmothers to the disease. The second died while Beaumont was pursuing a masterÃ¢ÂÂs degree in graphic design, when Beaumont was in her early 20s. Uncertain of her own risk, she went off in search of more information. She found leaflets of older women Ã¢ÂÂall smiling about breast cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂI couldnÃ¢ÂÂt relate to those materials,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂI didnÃ¢ÂÂt know what I should be looking for. What does a lump feel like, and when should I be screened?Ã¢ÂÂ Then, in 2002, Beaumont had an idea. She started photographing pairs of different items to illustrate breasts: cantaloupes, flashlights, muffins. She tried to put herself in the patientÃ¢ÂÂs shoes, setting up a mock mammogram appointment and talking with women in waiting rooms.  Finally, she found the visual metaphor she needed. Ã¢ÂÂEverything clicked,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂTheyÃ¢ÂÂre just these yellow, friendly lemons.Ã¢ÂÂ The campaign includes three images: the carton of lemons, a lemon slice to illustrate breast anatomy and a flowchart of the steps it may take to receive a breast cancer diagnosis. Beaumont says the lemonsÃ¢ÂÂ appeal is the key to avoiding the censorship and fear issues that come with images of breast cancer.  Ã¢ÂÂYou can be incredibly detailed about symptoms without grossing people out,Ã¢ÂÂ she said, recalling her experience looking at graphic breast cancer images online.  In the years since, the lemons have traveled to 70 countries in many languages. But it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt until this past week, when Chieze posted on Facebook, that they found overwhelming popularity. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm absolutely overwhelmed by the positivity that this campaign has generated,Ã¢ÂÂ Beaumont said. Ã¢ÂÂHealth brochures donÃ¢ÂÂt go viral.Ã¢ÂÂ The science behind the lemons, Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs all about knowing what changes to look for,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Andrea Barrio, a breast surgical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.  Barrio said the Ã¢ÂÂKnow Your LemonsÃ¢ÂÂ design illustrates how breast cancer symptoms can look very different depending on the type of cancer, how big it is and where it is growing.  Breast cancer often presents with a lump or a mass, but many cases, like ChiezeÃ¢ÂÂs, have no detectable lumps at all. However, most lumps are not cancerous and may be related to pregnancy, cysts, lymph nodes and hormonal changes.  Although 80% of breast lumps are benign, said Barrio, they should always be checked out by a doctor. The indentation Chieze noticed, Barrio said, may occur when cancer grows into the connective tissue that keeps the breastÃ¢ÂÂs normal shape and structure. These tissues, called CooperÃ¢ÂÂs ligaments, tug on the skin from the inside as the tumor grows, creating a dimple. An inverted nipple, said Barrio, can occur when the cancer invades the same connective tissue behind the nipple. One lemon has clear and dark fluid leaking from the stem end. Certain growths, such as benign tumors that occur in the breast ducts, can irritate the milk lining, creating a clear or bloody discharge, said Barrio. Most often, the discharge comes from one nipple, not both. A couple of the lemons show common signs of inflammation, such as redness and heat. With more advanced cancers, Barrio said, the breast may take on the appearance of what doctors call peau dÃ¢ÂÂorange, French for Ã¢ÂÂorange peel.Ã¢ÂÂ As the tumor grows, it can cause fluid to build up in the breast, making pores appear dimpled on the inflamed skin, like an orange rind. Ã¢ÂÂOur breasts normally drain fluid, like water flowing through a river,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂA tumor can almost be like a dam.Ã¢ÂÂ The lemons also show how a growing vein may indicate tumor growth underneath. More advanced cancers can even begin to grow out of the skin. Ã¢ÂÂIt can actually erode the skin, like a burn,Ã¢ÂÂ Barrio said. There are other cancer clues that are not illustrated in the viral graphic, according to Barrio. Rarely, cancers send cells up to the skinÃ¢ÂÂs surface, which can form tiny red skin nodules. Barrio said these can be easily mistaken for inflamed hair follicles at first, but they do not go away. Rashes caused by breast cancer can also be mistaken for eczema. Despite the popularity of the graphic, Barrio said, most of the cases she sees are picked up by routine mammogram before a patient has any symptoms. In her work as a surgeon, she does not often see patients with the symptoms in BeaumontÃ¢ÂÂs graphic. Ã¢ÂÂBut this can depend on screening and access to health care,Ã¢ÂÂ she said, adding that in areas such as many of the developing countries where the lemons have been distributed, many patients do arrive at the clinic with visible symptoms. Even then, Barrios cautions that a clear mammogram is not an  . Ã¢ÂÂYou can have a normal mammogram and still have changes that need to be looked into,Ã¢ÂÂ she said  Life after lemons, For BeaumontÃ¢ÂÂs next project, she is working with metastatic breast cancer patients through the Metastatic Breast Cancer Alliance, a patient advocate organization that connects breast cancer patients with resources and clinical trials. Her project will use similar images to prompt conversations between these patients and their doctors. Of the recent attention to her Facebook post, breast cancer patient and nursing student Chieze said, she has had mixed emotions. Having to tell her story and explain her disease at length can be difficult. Ã¢ÂÂAt the same time, being able to help someone along the way has been fantastic,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Chieze, whose prognosis is uncertain but whose cancer is currently in remission, hopes that the renewed attention in this campaign will support the ongoing demand for research and resources for metastatic breast cancer patients. About 22% of these patients live five years past their diagnoses, according to the American Cancer Society. Ã¢ÂÂI can only touch so many patients in a single day,Ã¢ÂÂ Chieze said, Ã¢ÂÂbut now IÃ¢ÂÂve been able to help people on a much larger scale.Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,Lemons teach about breast cancer,2049.0,2049.0,49.0,
2050," (CNN) The risk of dying from cervical cancer might be much higher than experts previously thought, and women are encouraged to continue recommended cancer screenings. Black women are dying from cervical cancer at a rate 77% higher than previously thought, and white women are dying at a rate 47% higher, according to a study published in the journal Cancer on Monday.  READ: Erin Andrews reveals cervical cancer surgery, The study found that previous estimates of cervical cancer death rates didnÃ¢ÂÂt account for women who had their cervixes removed in hysterectomy procedures, which eliminates the risk of developing the cancer. Ã¢ÂÂPrior calculations did not account for hysterectomy because the same general method is used across all cancer statistics,Ã¢ÂÂ said Anne Rositch, assistant professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore and lead author of the study. That method is to measure cancerÃ¢ÂÂs impact across a total population without accounting for factors outside of gender, she said. There were about 12, 990 new cases of cervical cancer in the United States last year and 4, 120 cervical cancer deaths, according to the National Cancer Institute. Ã¢ÂÂA better understanding of the magnitudeÃ¢ÂÂ For the study, researchers analyzed data on cervical cancer deaths in the United States, from 2000 to 2012, from the National Center for Health Statistics and the National Cancer InstituteÃ¢ÂÂs Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results databases.  The data were limited to only 12 states in the country, but the researchers noted that the data still provided a nationally representative sample of women. Then, the researchers collected data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System on how many women in 2000 to 2012, 20 and older, reported ever having a hysterectomy. They used that data to adjust the cervical cancer deaths rates. Before the adjustment, the data showed that the cervical cancer killed about 5. 7 out of 100, 000 black women and 3. 2 per 100, 000 white women. After adjusting for hysterectomies, the rate was 10. 1 per 100, 000 black women and 4. 7 per 100, 000 white women. The data showed that the racial disparity seen in cervical cancer death rates for black and white women was underestimated by 44% when hysterectomies were not taken into account.  Ã¢ÂÂWe canÃ¢ÂÂt tell from our study what might be contributing to the differences in cervical cancer mortality by age and race,Ã¢ÂÂ Rositch said. Ã¢ÂÂNow that we have a better understanding of the magnitude of the problem, we have to understand the reasons underlying the problem.Ã¢ÂÂ Cervical cancer is highly preventable in the United States because of the availability of screening tests and a vaccine to prevent human papillomavirus, or HPV, which can cause cervical cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Ã¢ÂÂRacial disparity may be explained by lack of access or limited access to cervical cancer screening programs among black women when compared to whites,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Marcela del Carmen, a gynecologic oncologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, who was not involved in the new study. Ã¢ÂÂThis gap and disparity need to be addressed with initiatives focusing on better access to prevention or screening programs, better access to HPV vaccination programs and improved access and adherence to standard of care treatment for cervical cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. The new findings add to the current understanding of cervical cancerÃ¢ÂÂs impact on different communities, said Dr. John Farley, a practicing gynecologic oncologist and professor at Creighton University School of Medicine at St. JosephÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital and Medical Center in Arizona. Ã¢ÂÂIt lets us know that there is substantial work to do to investigate and alleviate the racial minority disparity in cervical cancer in the US,Ã¢ÂÂ said Farley, who was not involved in the study but   an editorial about the new findings in the journal Cancer on Monday. Ã¢ÂÂThose who get cancer, many times, do not have access to screening,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.  Even though cervical cancer mortality rates are higher than previously thought, Farley said that he thinks the current screening recommendations for cervical cancer are still adequate. However, he added, more women should have access to screenings and other preventive measures. Rositch said, Ã¢ÂÂIt may be that some women are not obtaining screening according to our current guidelines, not necessarily that   care is insufficient.Ã¢ÂÂ How to prevent and screen for cervical cancer, The American Cancer Society recommends that women begin cervical cancer screenings at age 21 by having a Pap test every three years. Then, beginning at 30, women should have a Pap test combined with a HPV test every five years. However, the recommendations are not universal among all expert groups. Symptoms of cervical cancer tend to not appear until the cancer has advanced, which is why screening and HPV vaccinations are urged.  Ã¢ÂÂWe have a vaccine which can eliminate cervical cancer, like polio, that is currently available, and only 40% of girls age 13 to 17 have been vaccinated,Ã¢ÂÂ said Farley,   of the editorial. Ã¢ÂÂThis is an epic failure of our health care system in taking care of women in general and minorities specifically.Ã¢ÂÂ Women over 65 might not need to continue screening if they donÃ¢ÂÂt have a history of cervical cancer or negative Pap test results, according to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Each year, about 38, 793 new cases of cancer are found in parts of the body where HPV is often found. The virus has been linked not only to cervical cancer but to cancers of the vulva, vagina, penis, anus or throat.  A study published in the journal JAMA Oncology last week found that among a group of 1, 868 men in the United States, about 45% had genital HPV infections and only about 10% had been vaccinated. Ã¢ÂÂMale HPV vaccination may have a greater effect on HPV transmission and cancer prevention in men and women than previously estimated,Ã¢ÂÂ the researchers wrote in that study.",cancer,"Cervical cancer death rates are much higher than thought, study says",2050.0,2050.0,50.0,
2051," (CNN) A new study published earlier this week in the journal Cancer reveals that mortality rates are far higher and racial disparities in mortality are far larger than was previously thought for cervical cancer,  a disease that can be screened for and for which there is a vaccine.  As an Osteopathic Family Physician who provides womenÃ¢ÂÂs health services to my patients as well as medical care for general medical conditions, these findings directly impact my patients and my profession. As a black woman, they affect me personally. As a family physician, this study was a hard pill to swallow, but as a black woman it is even harder.  Racial disparities in health exist not only with cervical cancer but other cancers and medical conditions as well. The National Cancer Institute states that   have the highest mortality rate Ã¢ÂÂof any racial or ethnic group for all cancers combined and for most major cancers.Ã¢ÂÂ Furthermore, for all cancers combined, Ã¢ÂÂthe death rates is 25% higher for    than for whites. Researchers who conducted the study found that a lack of consideration for hysterectomy rates in prior studies has resulted in an Ã¢ÂÂunderestimationÃ¢ÂÂ of mortality rates and racial disparities regarding cervical cancer. When researchers adjusted US cervical mortality rates and racial disparities for the presence of hysterectomy in the study population, the results were staggering. Perhaps one of the most dramatic findings by researchers is that without correction for hysterectomy, racial disparities for cancer mortality rates between black and white women have been underestimated by about 44%. Somewhat more hopefully, the study showed that black women had a significant yearly decrease in cervical cancer mortality overall when compared to white women after correction for hysterectomy.  The sobering news is, however, that upon adjusting for hysterectomy, researchers found that the mortality for black women increased from 5. 7 per 100, 000 (uncorrected) to 10. 1 per 100, 000 (corrected) and for white women, the mortality rate increased from 3. 2 per 100, 000 (uncorrected) to 4. 7 per 100, 000 (corrected). Both corrected and uncorrected   cervical cancer mortality rates were much higher for black women than white women across all age groups except   and      and black women over 85 were at greatest risk of death.  The issue of the hysterectomy is clearly a key piece of information. One reason why is the body mechanics involved in complete hysterectomy, which also removes the cervix. Another reason, cited by study researchers, is a matter of numbers. Black women have the highest prevalence of hysterectomy. Thus the presence, or lack of, a hysterectomy potentially impacts how to measure the incidence of cervical cancer by race.  I have long known that health disparities exist between and among social groups. This is not a new phenomenon and it is not unique to cervical cancer, but it still takes my breath away that racial disparities in health continue to be so robust.  So why do health disparities by race persist and what can we do to fix them? The answer to both questions: ItÃ¢ÂÂs complicated. Institutions including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Institute of Medicine, the World Health Organization and so many others have been working on identifying and reducing racial disparities in health for years. In this study, researchers suggest as possible factors a lack of access to care, decreased   for abnormal results and disparities in cervical cancer treatments offered. I agree with the studyÃ¢ÂÂs authors. Access to quality care    something I think all Americans should have    is a crucial component to good health. This study underscores just how important this is.  The study also mentions that differences in cancer types may contribute to disparities in age and race: Ã¢ÂÂThe rates of adenocarcinoma in black women increase with age, whereas they plateau at the age of 35 in white women. . .. Compared with squamous histology, adenocarcinoma is associated with a worse prognosis and worse survival for both early  and   disease.Ã¢ÂÂ   The most critical reason access to affordable, quality care is so crucial is because it increases the likelihood of prevention. As a family physician, I also know how important preventive services such as mammograms, colonoscopies and pap smears (the most common screening test for cervical cancer) are. For cervical cancer, vaccines are also important. HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) vaccines    recommended since 2006    protect against strains of the HPV virus that cause most cervical cancers. Undoubtedly, the role of the HPV vaccine is important in preventing cervical cancer, and it is a vaccine that I routinely recommend and administer to my patients.  This study illustrates in stark terms the importance of accessible health care at a time when our current health care landscape is changing, as the Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010 will likely undergo change with the new administration. This may also mean a change for organizations that provide health services to women. As we work to improve mortality rates for all cancers and look for causes and solutions for racial disparities in health, these recent findings about cervical cancer should be part of the discussion.

2052," (CNN) Even though the phrase Ã¢ÂÂimage recognition technologiesÃ¢ÂÂ conjures visions of   surveillance, these tools may soon be used in medicine more than in spycraft.  A team of Stanford researchers trained a computer to identify images of skin cancer moles and lesions as accurately as a dermatologist, according to a new paper published in the journal Nature.  In the future, this new research suggests, a simple cell phone app may help patients diagnose a skin cancer    the most common of all cancers in the United States    for themselves.   Ã¢ÂÂOur objective is to bring the expertise of   dermatologists to places where the dermatologist is not available,Ã¢ÂÂ said Sebastian Thrun, senior author of the new study, founder of research and development lab Google X and an adjunct professor at Stanford University. He added that those who live in developing countries do not have the same level of care as can be found in the US and other industrialized nations. Melanomas represent fewer than 5% of all skin malignancies diagnosed in the US, yet they account for nearly   of all deaths related to this form of cancer. If detected early, the   survival rate for melanoma is 99%. When detected in its latest stage, the survival rate plummets to just 14%. Generally, dermatologists identify whether a mole or other abnormality is cancerous by looking at it. They can confirm their diagnosis with   biopsies and tests. With a team of researchers, Thrun developed a deep learning computer system to perform the first task in detecting skin cancer: identifying it at a glance.  Essentially, the team created an automated dermatologist. How it works, Thrun and his colleagues began by coaching a computer to develop pattern recognition skills. The method they used is an   technique known as Ã¢ÂÂdeep learning.Ã¢ÂÂ   Specifically, the research team employed a convolutional neural network. Carl Vondrick, a Ph. D. candidate at MITÃ¢ÂÂs Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, who was not involved in this study, explained the process. Ã¢ÂÂA convolutional neural net is a type of computer software that is very good at learning to recognize different concepts,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. By downloading digital images, researchers can Ã¢ÂÂtellÃ¢ÂÂ the computer they are images of skin cancer, or without skin cancer. The machine will basically try to learn some rules that can predict whether itÃ¢ÂÂs cancer. Ã¢ÂÂAn algorithm is just a fancy name for a sequence of steps that the computer takes. So in this case, the algorithm refers to the whole process that they did to train the system,Ã¢ÂÂ Vondrick said. Andre Esteva,   author of the new paper with Brett Kuprel, both electrical engineering Ph. D. students at Stanford, said he, Thrun and their colleagues began by Ã¢ÂÂbasically teaching the algorithm what the world looks like.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂWe taught it with cats and dogs and tables and chairs and all sorts of normal everyday objects look like,Ã¢ÂÂ Esteva said. Ã¢ÂÂWe used a massive data set of well over a million images.Ã¢ÂÂ This phase of learning took about a week. Then, Esteva trained the algorithm in different skin conditions. Here, the team addressed a complex problem: Cancerous and noncancerous skin aberrations vary greatly in appearance from patient to patient. To overcome this difficulty, the researchers presented the      or Ã¢ÂÂartificially intelligentÃ¢ÂÂ    computer with an extensive dataset of 129, 450 images representing more than 2, 000 skin diseases. The images came from 18   online repositories as well as the Stanford University Medical Center. Since each image of a mole or abrasion had been diagnosed, the computer was fed this information as well.  Differences between AI and human intelligence, Ã¢ÂÂWhatÃ¢ÂÂs really powerful about computer vision and these convolutional neural nets is, all you have to do is specify the input and output, and the machine will learn its own rules how to do that automatically,Ã¢ÂÂ Vondrick said. Ã¢ÂÂIt learns kind of a series of mathematical transformations to essentially transform an image into an answer (to the question) Ã¢ÂÂIs there skin cancer or not?Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ  ThereÃ¢ÂÂs an important distinction between computer visual systems and the human visual system, added Vondrick. Though humans can learn to recognize patterns from very little data, machines require thousands or even billions of examples. Ã¢ÂÂYou can grow up to be in your 20s and never have seen skin cancer, and you can go to medical school and just see a few examples on slides, and all of a sudden, youÃ¢ÂÂre going to be pretty good at recognizing that,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. No computer has been trained to do the same, but computer visual systems may detect subtleties within digital photographs unseen by the human eye, the researchers pointed out.  The moment of truth came when the researchers presented previously unseen images to their algorithm. Would their artificial intelligence system be able to recognize both the most common and the most deadly types of skin cancer: malignant carcinomas and melanomas, respectively?  Ã¢ÂÂThis algorithm performed as well as   dermatologists at several key diagnostic tasks,Ã¢ÂÂ Esteva said.  Notably, the computer was able to Ã¢ÂÂdiagnose multiple different kinds of skin cancer, not just melanoma, and we were able to do this with regular clinical images, rather than with specialized dermoscopic images,Ã¢ÂÂ said Roberto Novoa, a   of the study and a dermatologist at Stanford Medicine.  He explained that doctors commonly use a dermatoscope, a specialized tool, to examine the skin for cancer. This tool enables a view from a similar distance with similar lighting and magnification, for easier diagnosis.  Though the algorithm lacked access to this expensive tool, its performance still equaled the accuracy of 21 dermatologists. Though Thrun, Esteva and their colleagues warn that real testing in a clinical setting    a doctorÃ¢ÂÂs office    is still needed, they believe their research might be expanded to include other areas of medicine, such as ophthalmology, radiology and pathology.  With 6. 3 billion smartphone subscriptions estimated to be in use by 2021 (PDF) the researchers noted, their new system, in the form of an app, could provide   universal access to diagnostic care.   Paging Dr. McCoy, Science fiction is rife with visions of technology replacing human doctors. Dr. Leonard McCoy used a portable diagnostic device known as a tricorder to determine the medical condition of the USS Enterprise crew members in the Ã¢ÂÂStar TrekÃ¢ÂÂ TV series and movies, recalled Dr. Sancy A. Leachman, a dermatologist and chairwoman of the department of dermatology at Oregon Health and Science University, and Glenn Merlino, a senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute, in their published commentary on the new study. Though still Ã¢ÂÂfanciful,Ã¢ÂÂ machines capable of   diagnosis are Ã¢ÂÂbecoming a reality,Ã¢ÂÂ wrote Leachman and Merlino, neither of whom was involved in the new study.  That said, at least one issue still requires more investigation when it comes to a skin   automated system.  According to Leachman and Merlino, it is not known whether the artificial intelligence system featured in the new study can distinguish between   diseases. For example, a system would need to be able to identify melanoma versus benign seborrhoeic keratosis    basically, a   wart. Ã¢ÂÂEven the benign growths can be associated with certain syndromes and diseases that only a physician that has been clinically trained for detecting can diagnose,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Jill Waibel, a dermatologist and owner of the Miami Dermatology and Laser Institute.  Waibel, who did not participate in the study, added that Ã¢ÂÂmedical Imaging has dramatically transformed the practice of medicine,Ã¢ÂÂ especially her field of dermatology. Yet despite many exciting developments, all of the new imaging systems are still being studied and explored for optimal uses, she said.  For many scientists, though, Ã¢ÂÂStar TrekÃ¢ÂÂ still beckons: a future filled with machines that learn with each corrected mistake, improving their performance over time. Ã¢ÂÂThis is a very specific study, and it has a very encouraging result,Ã¢ÂÂ Thrun said. But he warned that before this research might be leveraged into anything resembling a tricorder, Ã¢ÂÂwe would have to run many more studies.Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,AI system detects skin cancer with expert accuracy,2052.0,2052.0,52.0,

But she soon found that the $400 monthly bill was too high for someone who was unemployed.  So she dropped Obamacare and opted for Medicaid, under WisconsinÃ¢ÂÂs BadgerCare Plus program. ItÃ¢ÂÂs the only state in the US to adopt federal guidelines for Medicaid expansion but not accept federal money.

They probably would qualify for a partial tax refund at the end of the year, but the    expense would likely be substantially more under the plan Congress is considering. Ã¢ÂÂThe lowest income individuals who currently receive premium subsidies,Ã¢ÂÂ said Woodruff, Ã¢ÂÂare going to be losers because theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to get fewer subsidies.Ã¢ÂÂ Many with cancer rely on Medicaid, He also said Medicaid recipients    the poorest and most vulnerable    will likely also suffer over time.   The Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act covered some 11 million Americans    but estimates by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities calculate the current Republican plan would cut $560 billion from the federal Medicaid program over the next decade.  Woodruff said today there are about 1. 5 million Americans with cancer relying on Medicaid, many of them children.

2055," (CNN) Fewer than half of ovarian cancer patients survive more than five years after their diagnosis. But new research indicates that preemptive surgery to remove a womanÃ¢ÂÂs ovaries and fallopian tubes might benefit more women than previously thought.  According to a recent study by Queen Mary University London scientists, for women age 40 or older with a lifetime risk level of 4% or greater, this operation, in combination with hormone replacement therapy, would provide 43 extra days of life expectancy on average. Though so few days may seem a very small gain to most people, Ã¢ÂÂthis is an average across the population,Ã¢ÂÂ explained Dr. Ranjit Manchanda, lead author of the study. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs pretty high in health statistics.Ã¢ÂÂ An individual woman might live considerably longer.  Ovarian cancer is the most lethal of reproductive cancers in women. According to Manchanda, 152, 000 deaths from ovarian cancer occur each year worldwide. Though it affects women of all ages, ovarian cancer is diagnosed most commonly after menopause. The strongest risk factors are older age and a family history.  Women at highest risk include those with a mother, sister or child affected by the disease and those who carry risk genes, including the BReast CAncer genes 1 and 2 (the BRCA genes).  Mutations in the BRCA  genes account for 15% of ovarian cancers overall, according to the National Cancer Institute. Actress Angelina Jolie put   surgery, known as   in the spotlight when she announced last year that sheÃ¢ÂÂd had the procedure to cut her cancer risk. Manchanda and his colleagues explored whether it might benefit women at different risk levels, since this operation is considered the best option for preventing disease among women at high risk of developing the disease. In fact, according to the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists (PDF) three studies demonstrated that carriers of BRCA mutations who undergo   surgery have a 71% to 96% reduction in the risk of subsequent ovarian cancer.  Though the surgery is generally safe and may be   it is not without complications. The ovaries contain a womanÃ¢ÂÂs reproductive eggs and secrete the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Younger women who undergo this surgery will be thrust into early menopause. The chances that a woman might develop heart disease increase after the procedure, and she might face osteoporosis as she ages, since estrogen helps build bones. Also, although the surgery may reduce anxiety, it often increases sexual dysfunction. Ã¢ÂÂOvarian conservation before menopause may be especially important in patients with a personal or strong family history of cardiovascular or neurological disease,Ã¢ÂÂ the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists said. Ã¢ÂÂConversely, women at high risk of ovarian cancer should undergo   bilateral  .Ã¢ÂÂ In the United Kingdom, the procedure is available only to women with at least a 10% lifetime risk of developing the disease. Yet this standard had never been tested for   Manchanda explained. So he and his colleagues used a mathematical model to compare preemptive surgery with no surgery for   women who were at least 40 years old but not yet menopausal.  They turned to national statistics of average life expectancies and years lived in good health for women with and without cancer. The researchers also looked at 2012 prices for surgeries, medication and other health care costs, and they calculated results for different levels of lifetime risk for ovarian cancer. Their analysis showed that preemptive surgery for women at a lifetime risk of 4% or greater would be   among those 40 or older.   The researchers admit their analysis is weak in that it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt include increased mortality data from other cancers. However, they believe their results are, overall, robust. In light of genome testing technologies and evolving genetic discoveries, Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ women might use surgery as a cancer risk management and prevention strategy, the evidence suggests. Ã¢ÂÂIt could open up possibilities for many women,Ã¢ÂÂ said Manchanda.",cancer,Ovarian cancer prevention extends life ,2055.0,2055.0,55.0,

2057," (CNN) The U. S. menÃ¢ÂÂs basketball team missed having NBA sideline reporter Craig Sager at the Olympics in Rio. So they sent him a special message during the broadcast at the start of the games. Ã¢ÂÂWe wish you were here, man.

The veteran reporter for TBS and TNT (both networks, like CNN, are part of Turner Broadcasting) who had never missed a day of work in his life, was suddenly sidelined. The diagnosis was grim: acute myeloid leukemia. Ã¢ÂÂYour world just comes crumbling down. ItÃ¢ÂÂs devastating,Ã¢ÂÂ said his wife, Stacy Sager. Ã¢ÂÂWhat he needed to do was just be strong and know that he and I can fight this together.Ã¢ÂÂ A son steps up, Sager went through chemo and needed a bone marrow transplant. As it turned out, his son Craig was a perfect match.  Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs a bond that you canÃ¢ÂÂt talk about or describe with a son,Ã¢ÂÂ Sager said. Ã¢ÂÂNow I was relying on him, and I needed him.Ã¢ÂÂ The transplant was successful, and Sager couldnÃ¢ÂÂt wait to return to the court. He received a standing ovation from fans at his first game back in March of 2015.  Ã¢ÂÂIt was just an incredible night,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂI thought that was it. IÃ¢ÂÂd beat cancer, and IÃ¢ÂÂd never have to worry about it again.Ã¢ÂÂ But the cancer came back. SagerÃ¢ÂÂs only option this time was a grueling clinical trial of 14 days of chemo at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.

2058," (CNN) Most shoppers wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt buy a gallon of milk if they thought they could only drink a pintÃ¢ÂÂs worth. So why are hospitals and clinics buying larger amounts of cancer therapies than they can use, forcing them to throw these expensive drugs in the trash? The answer, according to a new study, is that many of the top cancer drugs in the United States are only available in   vials, and often that dose is more than the average patient needs. The result is an estimated $3 billion in overspending in the health care system each year, a cost that gets passed on to taxpayers and patients.  In one of the more egregious examples, the pharmaceutical company Merck sells a melanoma drug, pembrolizumab, called Keytruda, in vials that contain 100 milligrams of the drug. A   patient gets about 140 milligrams of Keytruda, meaning that more than half of the second vial would not be used. Although some of the leftover drug might go to another patient, the study determined that on average, 21% of the drug, costing about $200 million, goes to waste. The problem with Keytruda tipped researchers off to look at the amount of waste among the 20 most common drugs used to treat a range of cancers, including breast, prostate, skin and colorectal. Waste was rampant.  Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt think we thought weÃ¢ÂÂd find multiple drugs with   percentage of the vials wasted, and that is what we found,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Peter B. Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Bach is the lead author of the study, which was published on Tuesday in The BMJ journal.  There was a large spread among the top 20 cancer medicines in how much of a vial is typically thrown out, from 1% up to 37%. The amount of waste was typically lower for medicines that were available in several   vial options containing a range of doses. Sharing vials between patients also reduced waste, but this is generally only practical at hospitals treating large numbers of cancer patients, not at doctorÃ¢ÂÂs offices.  Bach and his colleagues estimate that the companies producing the top 20 cancer medicines, including Genentech, Takeda and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, will make nearly $2 billion this year just from wasted drops of these most common cancer drugs. And doctors and hospitals will make $1 billion in markup fees from these tossed treatments.  Although insurance companies pick up the tab, it ultimately affects the entire population by driving up taxes and insurance premiums.  Ã¢ÂÂThe fact that we have insurance doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean someone else is paying the bills    we are paying the bills,Ã¢ÂÂ Bach said. Waste might be especially bad in the United States compared with other countries. TakedaÃ¢ÂÂs myeloma drug, bortezomib, called Velcade, is only available in 3.  vials in the United States, but the average patient only needs 2. 5 milligrams. More appropriately sized   vials are available in the United Kingdom. In a statement, a Takeda spokeswoman said the company Ã¢ÂÂworked closely with the FDA to establish the Velcade vial size of 3. 5 mg to ensure that one vial would provide an adequate amount of the drug for a patient of almost any size.Ã¢ÂÂ The company does not have plans to introduce additional vial size options to the U. S. market, the email statement said. In another example, Merck stopped selling its   vials of Keytruda in the United States last year. These smaller vials had less potential for waste than the   vials that replaced them. But in Europe, where agencies can participate in drug pricing decisions, the   vial is still available. According to a statement from Merck, Ã¢ÂÂour understanding of dosing in multiple tumor types has improved.Ã¢ÂÂ The company is now conducting trials of   Keytruda vials, which it says would Ã¢ÂÂeliminate wastage.Ã¢ÂÂ  However according to Bach, this strategy would only mean that more wasted medicine is administered to patients instead of thrown away. Ã¢ÂÂTheir new plan is to change the dose so all patients get all of the drug,Ã¢ÂÂ but studies so far do not suggest the higher dose would carry any benefit for patients, Bach said.   Bach and his colleagues suggest two possible solutions for reigning in cancer drug waste: Require companies to provide drugs in vials that contain more appropriate doses or require companies to refund the expense of leftover drug.  Ã¢ÂÂI think either one is pretty doable,Ã¢ÂÂ Bach said. Ã¢ÂÂThe (Food and Drug Administration) could definitely issue a much more instructive guidance on vial size where they ask companies to take into account this exact issue, and they can do that without an act of Congress. . .. Companies know the market and their regulators and will generally respond to that.Ã¢ÂÂ The current study is Ã¢ÂÂexcellent,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Daniel A. Goldstein, an adjunct assistant professor of medical oncology at Emory University and senior physician at Rabin Medical Center in Israel.  Ã¢ÂÂAs the elections are coming upon us and thereÃ¢ÂÂs increased discussion about the possibility of legislation to try to impact the pricing mechanism of cancer drugs, this paper is telling us one piece of legislation is to ensure drug companies are forced to provide multiple different options of vial sizes,Ã¢ÂÂ Goldstein said.  Referring to the milk analogy, Goldstein said that drugs should give you the option to buy them in the pint and gallon equivalents. Wasted cancer drugs is only one small part of overspending in healthcare in the U. S. compared with contributors such as excessive use of diagnostic testing and    care, Goldstein said. At the same time, he added that, Ã¢ÂÂthose are very complicated to solve, but this is an extremely simple thing to solve.",cancer,Why is $3 billion worth of cancer drugs being thrown away?,2058.0,2058.0,58.0,

Michael Flynn, called Islamism a Ã¢ÂÂvicious cancer inside the body of 1. 7 billion peopleÃ¢ÂÂ that has to be Ã¢ÂÂexcisedÃ¢ÂÂ during an August speech.  Flynn, who has called Islam as a whole a Ã¢ÂÂcancerÃ¢ÂÂ in the past, made the comments during a speech to the Ahavath Torah Congregation in Stoughton, Massachusetts. Video of his speech is available on YouTube and was reviewed by CNNÃ¢ÂÂs KFile.

2060," (CNN) After more patient deaths, Juno Therapeutics announced Wednesday that it is voluntarily putting its Ã¢ÂÂROCKETÃ¢ÂÂ trial on hold for the second time this year. The patients enrolled in this Phase II trial are adults with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, according to the biopharmaceutical companyÃ¢ÂÂs website. Ã¢ÂÂWe took this action after two additional patients in this trial experienced cerebral edema earlier this week,Ã¢ÂÂ Juno CEO Hans Bishop said on a conference call this morning. One patient died Tuesday, and another died earlier Wednesday. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a type of blood cancer that can spread quickly through the body and, if left untreated, can be fatal within months. Cerebral edema is brain swelling caused by excess fluid inside the skull. In July, the trial was put on a clinical hold at the direction of the Food and Drug Administration. At that time, the company revealed three patient deaths, also the result of cerebral edema. According to Bishop, investigators pinpointed the likely culprit as the addition of fludarabine to the   regimen. Fludarabine is a chemotherapy drug used here as a   primer for treatment, used in an effort to increase the effectiveness of the experimental therapy. In this particular course of treatment,   consists of a heavy dose of chemotherapy to kill off existing cancer cells in order to give the new     room to grow. ItÃ¢ÂÂs like hitting a reset button to restart the immune system. But an unforeseen interaction between fludarabine and genetically modified JCAR015 cells proved to be lethal. After petitioning the FDA, Juno was permitted to continue the trial without the use of fludarabine. In August, the trial resumed, and 12 patients have been treated since, said Juno Chief Medical Officer Mark Gilbert on Wednesday. This includes the two patients who died this week after being treated last week. The FDA monitors all US drug trials and says fatal adverse events are Ã¢ÂÂextremely rare.Ã¢ÂÂ Immunotherapy has been heralded as the new frontier in the war on cancer. It works by harnessing the bodyÃ¢ÂÂs immune system to fight cancer from within. But many of these   treatments are still in the experimentation phase.  A Phase II clinical trial is designed to test the effectiveness of a new drug or treatment. It typically follows a Phase I trial, which evaluates safety and side effects. Before a new drug or treatment goes to market, it must also pass through a Phase III trial, as outlined by the National Institutes of Health. Ã¢ÂÂGoing forward, all options remain on the table for JCAR015,Ã¢ÂÂ Bishop said Wednesday. Ã¢ÂÂThe options include, among others: moving forward with JCAR015 in the current study under a modified protocol, beginning a new study or terminating the program.Ã¢ÂÂ JunoÃ¢ÂÂs other ongoing trials, including JCAR017 cells, are not affected, according to the company. Ã¢ÂÂAny decision on how to move forward will of course need to be made, taking into account feedback from the FDA and our (Data and Safety Monitoring Board) as well as the treating physicians in the trial,Ã¢ÂÂ Bishop said. He added that the patients in this trial often have no other options.

The weeklong camps are held at picturesque locations, where 15 young adult cancer fighters and survivors from across the country come together to challenge themselves physically and bond with others whoÃ¢ÂÂve gone through the same battle.  Ã¢ÂÂWhile thousands of people have kayaked these sections of river before them, itÃ¢ÂÂs their first time down,Ã¢ÂÂ Ludden said. Ã¢ÂÂYou see it at the bottom of the rapids in the look of accomplishment and pride on their faces.Ã¢ÂÂ Since 2001, Ludden and his group have brought these transformative experiences to more than 3, 000 people.  Ã¢ÂÂI have learned more from First DescentsÃ¢ÂÂ participants than anything else in my entire life,Ã¢ÂÂ Ludden said. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve learned how to be much more vulnerable, the importance of laughter and to not just accept each day as it comes but to go out and define it.Ã¢ÂÂ CNNÃ¢ÂÂs Meghan Dunn spoke with Ludden about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation. CNN: During the week, you see a transformation in the participants. WhatÃ¢ÂÂs that like?  Ludden: Day one, they get all their gear and they learn the very basics of whatever it is theyÃ¢ÂÂre there to do. And then each day, we ratchet that up a little bit and build on the previous day so that by the end of the week, theyÃ¢ÂÂre applying everything theyÃ¢ÂÂve learned to one final challenging day. And that could be a   ascent, or a bigger break, or harder whitewater.  ItÃ¢ÂÂs fascinating to watch not only the physical transformation, but also the social and emotional transformation. The way they bond together and the confidence that theyÃ¢ÂÂre building Ã¢ÂÂ  itÃ¢ÂÂs a really beautiful transformation to witness in a relatively short amount of time. CNN: Each participant gets a nickname. Why? Ludden: (It) is a huge part of our culture. This experience can be a real stake in the sand in their recovery or their life  . It can be one of their greatest victories and a really defining experience. This name becomes associated with that experience.  ItÃ¢ÂÂs the name of them as a kayaker, or a climber, or a surfer. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not the name of them as someone with cancer. And so itÃ¢ÂÂs an opportunity for a fresh start. WeÃ¢ÂÂve found a lot of people take a lot of pride in their name. CNN: First Descents goes beyond a weeklong program. How do participants continue their journey? Ludden: The weeklong trip hopefully is the beginning of their First Descents experience. When they go home from that, weÃ¢ÂÂve created local adventure communities around the country that they can engage in, go on more localized adventures.  We host (additional)   to   programs. Those are much more   and are all over the world Ã¢ÂÂ  everywhere from Africa to Indonesia and Alaska to Patagonia.  We believe that this shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be a    experience. As part of that, we truly see healing in the act of helping someone else. And we believe that we all as a community who are experiencing these programs have the same obligation to help other people have the same experience. So we try to create this    aspect. We create fundraising challenges around the country that everyoneÃ¢ÂÂs invited to be a part of, all with the goal of providing that   experience to someone who hasnÃ¢ÂÂt had it, but wants it. CNN: What do you hope participants gain from each week?  Ludden: I hope that they come here seeking some answers, perhaps seeking some personal growth and maybe some victory over their cancer. We infuse a lot of challenge and adventure, beautiful settings, laughter, great people and good food. But I think at the end, all that bundled together just represents a very large transformation in everyoneÃ¢ÂÂs life.   ItÃ¢ÂÂs that important reminder that this life, itÃ¢ÂÂs really fleeting. The end is going to come sooner than we want. With that knowledge, we have this obligation to go out and live as fully as possible. Want to get involved?

2062," (CNN) On Friday, when the hospital chaplain asked Raul Hinojosa for his final wish, the   patient just said, Ã¢ÂÂI want to marry her.Ã¢ÂÂ His longtime fiancee, Yvonne Lamas, told CNN, Ã¢ÂÂI looked around the room, and said Ã¢ÂÂWho?Ã¢ÂÂ That was just the way we played.Ã¢ÂÂ  LetÃ¢ÂÂs do it, the chaplain said, and she left to get people to help make a dying wish into reality. Family and hospital staff hurried to put a wedding together. One of the hospitalÃ¢ÂÂs chaplains took Lamas to the courthouse to acquire a marriage license. When they arrived, the judge waived the typical   waiting period, Lamas said.  The director of the critical care unit    who never wears a coat and tie to work, but had that morning after going to see his daughterÃ¢ÂÂs Christmas program at school    shed his suit and gave it to Raul to wear for the ceremony, she said.  Cooks in the hospitalÃ¢ÂÂs cafeteria baked a wedding cake, and relatives ran out to get a dress for Lamas.  Ã¢ÂÂIt was a perfect fit,Ã¢ÂÂ said Angie Paiz, RaulÃ¢ÂÂs aunt.  After Hinojosa was admitted to a critical care unit in Amarillo, Texas, in late October, Lamas had spent every day at his side, balancing his needs with the needs of their children at home. Hinojosa and Lamas had been together for 11 years. Ã¢ÂÂHe was very respectful, very romantic and always wanted to give me the world,Ã¢ÂÂ Lamas said. Ã¢ÂÂHe knew how to put a smile on my face no matter the situation.Ã¢ÂÂ  They have a son who is 9, and Lamas has three daughters from a previous marriage, but Hinojosa took them in as if they were his own.  Ã¢ÂÂAs a father figure he was very loving, very caring to my kids,Ã¢ÂÂ Lamas said. Ã¢ÂÂHe gave them the world and was there for them when times were tough.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂHe was a good person. He was a giving person,Ã¢ÂÂ Paiz told CNN. He worked hard to provide for his family, picking up odd jobs even after he got sick because he couldnÃ¢ÂÂt keep a steady one.  Hinojosa proposed in 2007, but he and Lamas had been waiting to marry. Ã¢ÂÂHe was determined to give me the best fairytale wedding,Ã¢ÂÂ Lamas said. Ã¢ÂÂHe tried saving up, but within that time he ended up getting diagnosed with the leukemia.Ã¢ÂÂ  Hospital bills stacked up, and it started to look as if their dreams would never be realized. But within a couple of hours, thanks to the collective effort of family and the hospital staff, the wedding was ready.  Nursing staff lined up outside the hospital room, and Lamas was escorted down the makeshift aisle by her father.  Ã¢ÂÂWhen I walked down the aisle and saw him in the suit, he just took my breath away,Ã¢ÂÂ Lamas said. Ã¢ÂÂHe was so handsome. It was priceless.Ã¢ÂÂ Her father delicately placed LamasÃ¢ÂÂ hand in HinojosaÃ¢ÂÂs, and the chaplain choked back tears as she recounted their story. Ã¢ÂÂWhen this illness was diagnosed,Ã¢ÂÂ she said, Ã¢ÂÂYvonne promised she would never leave him. She would be with him. They would do this together.Ã¢ÂÂ  With his    on his left and his son on his right, Hinojosa recited his vows.  With their children, family and friends gathered around them, Hinojosa and Lamas were finally married.  Hinojosa, 33, died of leukemia on Saturday, just 36 hours later.  When she signed her husbandÃ¢ÂÂs death certificate, it was the first time Lamas had signed her married name.",cancer,Man weds fiancee hours before succumbing to cancer,2062.0,2062.0,62.0,
2063,"Two thin tubes that connect the ovaries to the uterus have assumed an outsize role in the battle against ovarian cancer.  Research increasingly points to the likelihood that some of the most aggressive ovarian cancers originate in the fallopian tubes. Most doctors now believe there is little to lose by removing the tubes of women who are done bearing children    and potentially much to gain in terms of cancer prevention. The stakes in this research are high. Ovarian cancer is the deadliest of gynecologic cancers, killing 14, 000 women a year in the United States. It is often diagnosed in the late stages, when it is more difficult to treat.  Routine screening tests to identify it early largely have been discredited. Earlier this fall, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration released a statement recommending against their use. For that reason, prevention is particularly important. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs a really interesting topic and itÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Noelle Cloven, a gynecologic oncologist with Texas Oncology in Fort Worth. Ã¢ÂÂAny opportunity to decrease the risk of ovarian cancer or improve our understanding of ovarian cancer, IÃ¢ÂÂm in support of that. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a terrible disease.Ã¢ÂÂ  The risks associated with the removal of the fallopian tubes    known as salpingectomy    appear to be minimal, according to a study by Kaiser Permanente Northern California, which was published this summer in the journal Obstetrics  Gynecology. (Kaiser Health News is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.) Between June 2013 and May 2014, nearly 73 percent of the women in the study had their fallopian tubes removed while undergoing a routine hysterectomy. Just two years earlier, fewer than 15 percent of a comparable group had. The large increase yielded no difference in surgical outcomes. And operating times and blood loss were slightly improved for patients whose fallopian tubes were removed.  Dr. Bethan Powell, senior author of the study and a gynecologic oncology surgeon with Kaiser Permanente, said the fallopian tubes until recently have been Ã¢ÂÂa neglected region.Ã¢ÂÂ As a result, when women were undergoing hysterectomy    the removal of the uterus and cervix    the tubes were often left behind. Ã¢ÂÂNobody thought it made any difference which side you put your clamp on,Ã¢ÂÂ Powell said. Ã¢ÂÂIf there are health benefits to leaving the ovary, we should leave the ovary. But thereÃ¢ÂÂs no reason we should leave the tube.Ã¢ÂÂ In recent years, two medical societies have issued statements about the importance of removing the fallopian tubes. In 2013, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology developed a clinical practice statement recommending the removal of both fallopian tubes as Ã¢ÂÂa viable approach to prevent ovarian cancer.Ã¢ÂÂ   In 2015, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended that surgeons discuss the potential cancer prevention benefits of the procedure with their patients.  While itÃ¢ÂÂs now recommended that patients have their tubes removed during a routine hysterectomy, doctors are still wrestling with more complicated scenarios. Jennifer Klute, 35, a   pathologist in Napa, Calif. was diagnosed breast cancer in 2015. SheÃ¢ÂÂd first noticed a lump while breastfeeding her daughter, Genevieve, and doctors initially reassured her that the lump was probably related to that.  Then the lumps multiplied. Biopsies were ordered. Klute received the dreaded phone call, and cut short a family vacation to Nebraska. Klute had a family history of breast cancer and a genetic test revealed a BRCA1 mutation. Women who are positive for the BRCA1 mutation have a 39 percent likelihood of developing ovarian cancer, in addition to a 55 to 65 percent likelihood of developing breast cancer. Klute faced a difficult decision. ItÃ¢ÂÂs recommended that women with the mutation have their fallopian tubes and ovaries removed between the ages of 35 and 40, as actress Angelina Jolie did in 2015.  Jolie earlier had a preventive double mastectomy. Removal of the ovaries has significant cancer prevention benefits    both for ovarian and breast cancer. But it also carries real consequences, particularly for younger women like Klute. The ovaries regulate hormones and their removal plunges women into early menopause and increases their risk of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease and dementia. Klute had chemotherapy, radiation and a double mastectomy. Once she recovered, her doctor recommended she have her fallopian tubes and ovaries removed. Klute requested a second opinion and ended up meeting with Powell. Klute told Powell that while she had a family history of breast cancer, she didnÃ¢ÂÂt have one of ovarian cancer.  Klute wondered whether she might delay the removal of her ovaries for a few more years. She didnÃ¢ÂÂt plan to have more children, but she knew keeping her ovaries a little longer could reduce her risk of other health problems. Powell knew that leaving the ovaries in   women is Ã¢ÂÂnot recommended and not standardÃ¢ÂÂ at this point. But she was willing to discuss the idea with Klute, who eventually opted to keep her ovaries for a little longer. She knows theyÃ¢ÂÂll eventually need to go. Not all doctors feel comfortable offering such a choice to their   patients. Dr. Jill Whyte, a gynecologic oncologist at Northwell Health on Long Island, is waiting for more data before sheÃ¢ÂÂs willing to recommend it. Cloven, the gynecologic oncologist  in Texas, also said she would be nervous taking that approach unless the patient was Ã¢ÂÂreally motivatedÃ¢ÂÂ and understood the risks of delays. Even then, Cloven said she would prefer that a patient choose that option only if participating in a clinical trial.  Nevertheless, Lisa Schlager, vice president of community affairs and public policy for Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered, a   advocacy group devoted to hereditary ovarian and breast cancers, said she thinks more doctors are recommending the approach as an interim step for   women in their 30s.  Ã¢ÂÂIf you want to have children and donÃ¢ÂÂt want to be plunged into surgical menopause, the options are: do nothing, do imperfect screening, or Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂThat   is salpingectomy.Ã¢ÂÂ In KluteÃ¢ÂÂs case, she said the salpingectomy itself was easy: Powell made a small laparoscopic incision to remove the tubes. Klute had a little nausea after she woke and couldnÃ¢ÂÂt lift Genevieve for a few weeks. But the pain was manageable.  SheÃ¢ÂÂs now enrolled in two clinical studies and has submitted her information to the National Salpingectomy Registry. Ã¢ÂÂI think thatÃ¢ÂÂs super important,Ã¢ÂÂ Klute said. Ã¢ÂÂThe more knowledge we have, the more informed decisions we can make    and the greater the outcomes for individuals with cancer.Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,Fallopian tubes may have big role in ovarian cancer fight,2063.0,2063.0,63.0,
2064," (CNN) Josh Katrick had just walked out of his eighth round of chemotherapy, when good fortune struck.  He had just won a competition: free pizza for a year from a neighborhood restaurant in Pennsylvania.  But instead of seizing the opportunity to spend the better part of 2017 gorging on the   melted mozzarella wellspring, Katrick, who has colon cancer, decided other people needed it more.  So he gave every slice away.  The local Northampton food bank is the recipient of his generosity.  Ã¢ÂÂYou know the saying, Ã¢ÂÂWhen life gives you lemons make lemonade,Ã¢ÂÂ well, when life gives you pizza, give away a slice,Ã¢ÂÂ the    told CNN Sunday.   Katrick has been feasting on MarioÃ¢ÂÂs Pizza in Northampton since he was a child, and was one of 1, 200 people to enter the competition.  The winner would walk away with 2 large (and they mean large) pizzas and soda, every month for the next year.  But after KatrickÃ¢ÂÂs act of holiday kindness, the pizza restaurant about 65 miles north of Philadelphia decided to extend its own.  The restaurant is doubling the prize to make sure Katrick gets his share of pizza, along with the food bank.  Ã¢ÂÂI thought someone would win, theyÃ¢ÂÂd be excited, come in and get their pizzas, but a story like this to come out of a contest like that. ..Ã¢ÂÂ Giuseppe Aiello, the son of the   pizzeriaÃ¢ÂÂs   told CNN affiliate WFMZ.  Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs better to give than receive, and especially during this time of year    Christmas,Ã¢ÂÂ Aiello said.  Katrick said he was inspired to pay it forward because of the generosity he had received from others during his cancer treatment. Ã¢ÂÂAfter everything I went through these last few months    I met so many people and have been receiving so much    I felt I wanted to give back.Ã¢ÂÂ Katrick said. Ã¢ÂÂThe food bank are very thankful. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre amazed by it.

2065," (CNN) Ever marvel at someone who smoked and still lived to be 90? Just plain good luck, researchers say. And those who live like Puritans and get cancer anyway?  ThatÃ¢ÂÂs bad luck    and itÃ¢ÂÂs the primary cause of most cancer cases, says a Johns Hopkins Medicine research study. Roughly   of cancers in adults can be attributed to random mutations in genes capable of driving cancer growth, said two scientists who ran statistics on cancer cases. That may sound  . And Johns Hopkins anticipates that the study will change the way people think about cancer risk factors.  They also believe it could lead to changes in the funding of cancer studies, with a greater focus on finding ways to detect those cancers attributed to random mutations in genes at early, curable stages. Smoking can still kill you, But, no, thatÃ¢ÂÂs not permission to smoke or to not use sunblock.  Some forms of cancer are exceptions, where lifestyle and environment play a big role. Lung cancer is one of them. So is skin cancer. And, if cancer runs in your family, this unfortunately doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean youÃ¢ÂÂre in the clear. Some cancers are more strongly influenced by genetic heritage than others. Ã¢ÂÂThe remaining third (of cancer cases) are due to environmental factors and inherited genes,Ã¢ÂÂ the Kimmel Cancer Center said in a statement on the study published Friday in the magazine Science. In fact, all three factors work together. Ã¢ÂÂAll cancers are caused by a combination of bad luck, the environment and heredity, and weÃ¢ÂÂve created a model that may help quantify how much of these three factors contribute to cancer development,Ã¢ÂÂ said cancer researcher Bert Vogelstein. Compounding matters, An unhealthy lifestyle can compound matters, but more for some cancers than for others, the scientists said. Ã¢ÂÂChanging our lifestyle and habits will be a huge help in preventing certain cancers, but this may not be as effective for a variety of others,Ã¢ÂÂ medical statistician Cristian Tomasetti said. He placed heavy emphasis on early detection. Stem cells in our organs divide constantly to replenish damaged tissue. Sometimes there are random mistakes in the replication of DNA, small mutations, Vogelstein said.  Some genes, when they mutate, are more apt to promote cancer growth.  Ã¢ÂÂThe more these mutations accumulate, the higher the risk that cells will grow unchecked, a hallmark of cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ Vogelstein said. Scientist have known this for a long time, but what the study reveals was how big of an influence it is. Ã¢ÂÂThe actual contribution of these random mistakes to cancer incidence, in comparison to the contribution of hereditary or environmental factors, was not previously known,Ã¢ÂÂ says Vogelstein. Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, told CNN the study was Ã¢ÂÂgood scienceÃ¢ÂÂ that backed up what many scientists already thought.  Ã¢ÂÂThis is actually just confirmation of something that we have known for probably 20 years,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂAs we have learned more and more about cancer . .. weÃ¢ÂÂve come to realize that a number of cancers start purely because of mutations that happen that are just unexplainable. Bad luck is, unfortunately, the right way to explain it.Ã¢ÂÂ Those cancers that develop have escaped at least three   systems in the body that deal with these cell mutations, he said these are programmed cell death, or apoptosis, DNA repair enzymes and certain cells in the immune system. Cell division and statistics, For their study, the two scientists came up with an average total number of cell divisions in 31 different tissues within a human lifetime. And they looked at the cancer risk in each of those tissues. They determined that the more a tissueÃ¢ÂÂs cells divide, the higher the chance cancer could develop in that tissue. Ã¢ÂÂOur study shows, in general, that a change in the number of stem cell divisions in a tissue type is highly correlated with a change in the incidence of cancer in that same tissue,Ã¢ÂÂ says Vogelstein. Colon tissue, for example, divides much more than other intestinal tissue, and cancer in the colon is much more prevalent there, the study said.  With colon tissue, the scientists took environmental influences into account. Doing the math overall, the two scientists arrived at a rate at which cancer risk can be explained by the cell divisions. It was 65% they said. Lifestyle, But the researchers drew a line between one group of cancers and another. Of the 31 they looked at, they determined that 22 were basically Ã¢ÂÂbad luckÃ¢ÂÂ cancers. But nine others appeared at rates noticeably higher than could be expected from cell division alone    which the researchers said is probably due to habits, pollution or genetics. No surprise: Lung cancer and skin cancer were two of them, they said. Smoking and too much sun exposure are still strongly linked to those cancers. Brawley said the studyÃ¢ÂÂs findings should be no reason to alter behaviors shown to lessen the risk of cancer. Ã¢ÂÂWe have good epidemiological data to show that people can reduce their risk of cancer and I would encourage them to do those things,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. They include not smoking, managing their weight so they donÃ¢ÂÂt become obese and taking physical exercise, he said. As for the suggestion the studyÃ¢ÂÂs findings may prompt changes in funding, Brawley said he would be pleased just to see more money go into research. Ã¢ÂÂOnly 10% of the grants submitted to the NIH (National Institutes of Health) actually get funded because we have such a shortage of money,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂWe invested in the United States last year $5 billion in cancer research. I would like to see more.Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,Cancer: Ã¢ÂÂBad luckÃ¢ÂÂ seen as primary cause in study,2065.0,2065.0,65.0,
2066," (CNN) It is an unmistakable voice, that of Oliver Sacks, neurologist. Ã¢ÂÂPrecise, probing, and epigrammaticÃ¢ÂÂ is how Wired writer Steve Silberman once described it. And soon, the world learned Thursday, it  may be silenced. In a New York Times essay that received instant acclaim for its poignancy, beauty and determination, the renowned scientist and doctor revealed that he has incurable cancer. Ã¢ÂÂOver the last few days, I have been able to see my life as from a great altitude, as a sort of landscape, and with a deepening sense of the connection of all its parts, Ã¢ÂÂ he wrote in the Times. Ã¢ÂÂThis does not mean I am finished with life.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂOn the contrary, I feel intensely alive, and I want and hope in the time that remains to deepen my friendships, to say farewell to those I love, to write more, to travel if I have the strength, to achieve new levels of understanding and insight,Ã¢ÂÂ wrote Sacks, 81. Ã¢ÂÂOliver Sacks has cancer. Damn. He writes about it as beautifully as you would expect,Ã¢ÂÂ Twitter user Ian Leslie wrote. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not SacksÃ¢ÂÂ first bout with the disease. Nearly a decade ago, he was diagnosed with  ocular melanoma that eventually left him blind in one eye and served as the basis for one of his books, Ã¢ÂÂThe MindÃ¢ÂÂs Eye.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂAlthough the radiation and lasering to remove the tumor ultimately left me blind in that eye, only in very rare cases do such tumors metastasize. I am among the unlucky 2 percent,Ã¢ÂÂ he wrote in the Times. Ã¢ÂÂI feel grateful that I have been granted nine years of good health and productivity since the original diagnosis, but now I am face to face with dying. The cancer occupies a third of my liver, and though its advance may be slowed, this particular sort of cancer cannot be halted.Ã¢ÂÂ The   Sacks, who is on the staff of the New York University School of Medicine, is perhaps best known as the inspiration for the doctor portrayed by the late actor Robin Williams in the 1990 film Ã¢ÂÂAwakenings.Ã¢ÂÂ The film is based on SacksÃ¢ÂÂ 1973 book of the same name, recounting his experiences treating patients who long been in a catatonic state after contracting Ã¢ÂÂsleeping sickness.Ã¢ÂÂ In his long career, he has made a practice of marrying clinical practice with narrative storytelling. Ã¢ÂÂIf we wish to know about a man, we ask Ã¢ÂÂwhat is his story    his real, inmost story?Ã¢ÂÂ    for each of us is a biography, a story,Ã¢ÂÂ he wrote in his 1985 book, Ã¢ÂÂThe Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂEach of us is a singular narrative, which is constructed, continually, unconsciously, by, through, and in us    through our perceptions, our feelings, our thoughts, our actions and, not least, our discourse, our spoken narrations,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂBiologically, physiologically, we are not so different from each other historically, as narratives    we are each of us unique.Ã¢ÂÂ The habit that endeared him to many also brought criticism from some who accused him of being exploitative. Disability advocate Tom Shakespeare once called him Ã¢ÂÂthe man who mistook his patients for a literary career.Ã¢ÂÂ But little of that was evident Thursday as fans reacted to the news, seizing on the eloquence of the essay and hoping for yet more from Sacks before he goes. In his essay, Sacks says he plans to ignore politics and leave debate over climate change to the next generation, and instead focus on living Ã¢ÂÂin the richest, deepest, most productive way I can.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂI feel a sudden clear focus and perspective. There is no time for anything inessential. I must focus on myself, my work and my friends.Ã¢ÂÂ For fans, there is good news among the gloom.

2067," (CNN) Dropping red meat, and sticking to a   diet that incorporates fish may be the key to preventing colorectal (colon and rectum) cancers, according to a   study published Monday. Pescetarians, as they are commonly referred, had a 43% lower chance of getting the cancer compared to people with omnivorous diets. Why focus on colorectal cancer? It is the third most diagnosed cancer, and the third leading cause of   death in the US in 2014, according to American Cancer Society statistics. The disease is particularly dangerous because it is usually asymptomatic in its early stages, making it more difficult to detect when itÃ¢ÂÂs less deadly. Only 59% of those recommended for screenings receive procedures that are in line with the American Cancer SocietyÃ¢ÂÂs standards.  The study, which followed nearly 78, 000 people and was published in the Journal of American Medical Association, adds to the growing body of evidence touting the health benefits of a   diet. Another study, reviewing data from 39 separate studies showing that a plant based diet leads to an average drop in blood pressure similar to   minutes of exercise per day. Yet another study from last year found an average weight loss of nearly 7. 5 pounds for vegetarians.  While evidence shows the health benefits of reducing red meat consumption, the recent study highlights the differences between even a fully vegetarian diet and a pescetarian diet. Within the sample group there was a 27% drop in the risk of contracting colorectal cancer if you switch from fully vegetarian to eating fish. The authors of the study suggest that   fatty acids may be the key to such a low risk of cancer in the pescetarian group. Nutritionist Lisa Drayer agrees. Ã¢ÂÂIn addition to other dietary factors, fish may provide added protection from its high content   fatty acids. This is consistent with previous research that has found   have   activity and that they may be helpful in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.Ã¢ÂÂ Some questions can be raised though, from observing the recent studyÃ¢ÂÂs participants Seventh Day Adventists, a group that typically avoids alcohol and tobacco. But despite the caveat, Drayer is optimistic. Ã¢ÂÂWhile the study is observational and cannot prove a   relationship, it is exciting to think that in addition to regular screenings, a diet rich in fish and   foods may play an important role in reducing the risk of colorectal cancer.Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,Cancer risk drops for vegetarians eating fish,2067.0,2067.0,67.0,

Ã¢ÂÂI started taking guitar lessons when I was 11 years old, and IÃ¢ÂÂve been singing for as long as I can remember.Ã¢ÂÂ Allison hopes that, despite the tumor, sheÃ¢ÂÂll still be able to pursue singing as a career. The diagnosis, Music wasnÃ¢ÂÂt always the primary focus of AllisonÃ¢ÂÂs life. She initially hoped to become a competitive figure skater, training six days a week for more than five years.  The intense training was something she learned from her mother, who was an Olympic marathon runner in 1996.  It was through skating that Allison first suspected something might be wrong. Ã¢ÂÂHer skating coach noticed that just walking up a flight of stairs, sheÃ¢ÂÂd breathe hard,Ã¢ÂÂ said her mother, May Allison. It seemed unusual that such a young athlete might have trouble breathing. Allison and her family went for a year believing    as doctors told them    that she had asthma. But a CT scan in February revealed a clear cell sarcoma outside the trachea. Allison knew her skating career would be put on hold. Teen with cancer blogs her bucket list, A rediscovered passion, Without skating to fill her time, Allison turned her efforts to singing. She has uploaded seven videos to YouTube in the past year, where she has nearly 50, 000 views. Ã¢ÂÂEverything happens for a reason,Ã¢ÂÂ she said of her condition. Ã¢ÂÂIt was an easy switch to put music as the biggest thing in my life right now . .. and my music has taken off, which is nice.Ã¢ÂÂ In April, her videos received the notice of actress and pop star Selena Gomez. Gomez tweeted, Ã¢ÂÂCarley Allison you are so strong girl. Love you! And praying for you. Keep singing.Ã¢ÂÂ The words echo many of the comments on AllisonÃ¢ÂÂs YouTube and Twitter pages    and helped her singing videos take off online. She has certainly followed GomezÃ¢ÂÂs advice, too. Singing is Ã¢ÂÂtherapeutic for her in a way,Ã¢ÂÂ said her mother. May Allison believes this is the best way her daughter has found to deal with the fact that she has a hole in her trachea and her hair has been shaved down, and itÃ¢ÂÂs how she has chosen to express herself.  Her daughter put it this way: Ã¢ÂÂBefore February 4, my biggest problem was trying to find a prom dress.Ã¢ÂÂ May Allison added, Ã¢ÂÂShe wants to make something of (her condition) instead of moping around.Ã¢ÂÂ AllisonÃ¢ÂÂs focus on singing isnÃ¢ÂÂt unusual for a patient, said Dr. Michael E. Kupferman of the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. He has seen others with cancer turn to creative outlets. Ã¢ÂÂAny kind of devastating medical situation will make people more introspective,Ã¢ÂÂ he explained. Ã¢ÂÂArtistsÃ¢ÂÂ careers have sometimes evolved having gone through cancer. IÃ¢ÂÂve seen patients find that creativity to express themselves whether in music or in art. WeÃ¢ÂÂve seen that for millennia. It changes the tenor of their art and productivity.Ã¢ÂÂ What the future holds, Will Allison still be able to belt out her songs in the same way when her cancer is eventually surgically removed? Luckily, Ã¢ÂÂher vocal cords are not involved with the tumor,Ã¢ÂÂ according to her mother. Teen beating the odds after brain injury, However, she added, Ã¢ÂÂThe one side that the tumorÃ¢ÂÂs on, the vocal cord nerve may be affected by the tumor. ItÃ¢ÂÂs very difficult to tell on the CT scan. WeÃ¢ÂÂre hoping the chemotherapy will help the situation.Ã¢ÂÂ Allison herself maintains a positive attitude.  Ã¢ÂÂThere is a smaller chance there may be some permanent damage, but I try not to think about that,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Early on, there were some fears as well. Allison admitted that she was originally scared by her diagnosis after searching online. She has since mostly stayed away from searching for information on her illness. When the family learned about the tumor, May Allison said she and her husband got choked up. Ã¢ÂÂ(Carley) turned to us in a calm voice and said she was glad it was her and not anyone else in the family, because she knew she could handle it.Ã¢ÂÂ Despite being told there was a 5% chance that chemotherapy would affect a tumor in the trachea, the tumor has become softer since treatment and has moved away from the thyroid gland, which makes it easier to remove surgically. No matter what happens, Allison still plans to pursue her passions. SheÃ¢ÂÂs still thinking about a possible singing career, despite the fact that she had to cancel an audition for BostonÃ¢ÂÂs Berklee College of Music a few days after she was diagnosed. She looks forward to getting back on the ice one day as well. ItÃ¢ÂÂs that unstoppable attitude that has been the most inspirational to witness, her mother said. Ã¢ÂÂFrom an early age, Carley always knew what she wanted and had no fear trying to get it,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂFor her, every day presents a new opportunity to take a step closer. The interesting thing about Carley is that she actually enjoys the journey as much as achieving her goals. When things donÃ¢ÂÂt go according to plan, she rallies quickly and moves on. She has the ability to make anything fun and finds it very difficult to sit still.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂSheÃ¢ÂÂs been able to touch people,Ã¢ÂÂ May Allison added. Ã¢ÂÂHer public school raised $5, 000 in a fundraiser for (TorontoÃ¢ÂÂs) Sick Kids Hospital where sheÃ¢ÂÂs having her chemotherapy. There are thousands of dollars coming into Princess Margaret Hospital where she has the link on her blog. SheÃ¢ÂÂs very proud of that.Ã¢ÂÂ In the meantime, Allison continues to inspire people on social media with her positive attitude. Ã¢ÂÂFor me to be able to reach out to other people throughout all this has been great,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂPeople want to hear from me and hear my music right now so it keeps me happy. I cherish every moment. I have a different perspective on everything now. In the end, I think it will make me a better person.Ã¢ÂÂ 36 stories that prove citizen journalism matters",cancer,Cancer canÃ¢ÂÂt stop teen singerÃ¢ÂÂs music,2068.0,2068.0,68.0,
2069," (CNN) All Elizabeth Sedway wanted was to leave paradise and head home. But she couldnÃ¢ÂÂt.  Why? Because, according to her, she has cancer. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what she said in a video posted to Facebook that shows her group packing up from their Alaska Airlines plane as it sat at the gate in Hawaii.  Ã¢ÂÂYouÃ¢ÂÂre taking me off the airplane because I donÃ¢ÂÂt have a doctorÃ¢ÂÂs note saying I can fly,Ã¢ÂÂ a woman is heard saying. Ã¢ÂÂAll these people are waiting, and IÃ¢ÂÂm being removed as if  IÃ¢ÂÂm a criminal or contagious, because I have cancer and no note to fly.Ã¢ÂÂ Sedway did eventually get on a flight back to San Jose, California, although she didnÃ¢ÂÂt get home until late Tuesday night.  And she got an apology. Ã¢ÂÂWe regret the inconvenience Ms. Sedway experienced . .. and are very sorry for how the situation was handled,Ã¢ÂÂ Alaska Airlines spokeswoman Bobbie Egan said. Ã¢ÂÂ. .. While our employee had the customerÃ¢ÂÂs   in mind, the situation could have been handled differently.Ã¢ÂÂ Her cancer fight notwithstanding, Sedway was in Hawaii in time to celebrate her 14th wedding anniversary. Still, on Monday, she was on a plane to head east. Then, according to her Facebook post, an airline employee who saw Sedway seated in the handicapped section asked her how she was doing. The second time she inquired, Sedway wrote that she responded by saying she sometimes felt weak. That was followed by a call to a doctor, then her removal from the plane. Egan, the Alaska Airlines spokeswoman, acknowledged that the carrierÃ¢ÂÂs policy when someone has a medical issue is to call MedLink, a group of ER nurses and doctors. The idea, she explained, is that Ã¢ÂÂit is better to address medical issues or concerns on the ground rather than in the air, especially on flights to or from HawaiiÃ¢ÂÂ    which in that case would last   hours over open ocean. The decision to pull Sedway from the flight was done with Ã¢ÂÂthe customerÃ¢ÂÂs  Ã¢ÂÂ in mind, according to Egan. Still, that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean it was the right decision. Alaska Airlines since apologized to Sedway Ã¢ÂÂfor the disruption this has caused,Ã¢ÂÂ in addition to refunding her familyÃ¢ÂÂs tickets and paying for their overnight accommodations.Ã¢ÂÂ Even though she was stuck in Hawaii, Sedway made clear on Facebook that this was a real Ã¢ÂÂdisruption.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂBecause of this, I will miss my chemotherapy, my children will miss school and my husband will miss important meetings,Ã¢ÂÂ she said.",cancer,Woman with cancer told she canÃ¢ÂÂt fly back home,2069.0,2069.0,69.0,

Wilson, 58, revealed in a statement to People magazine that she underwent a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma, a form of breast cancer.

2072,"Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) Nearly 12 million parents in the United States currently are raising kids on their own.   When single parents face a devastating illness such as cancer, everyday needs like cleaning and cooking can become a struggle.  Jody   saw the need firsthand, when her childhood friend faced that situation. Ã¢ÂÂMaking ends meet is insurmountable,Ã¢ÂÂ said  . Ã¢ÂÂThere are so many doctorsÃ¢ÂÂ appointments, copays, surgeries, prescriptions.  And then the inability to work    any savings that there may have been is gone very quickly.Ã¢ÂÂ She did all she could to help.  After her friend passed away,   helped start a nonprofit dedicated to assisting others in similar circumstances.  Since 2006, Singleton Moms has provided practical, financial and emotional support to more than 300 parents in the Phoenix area. Tiffany Montgomery, 48, was a newly single mom when she was diagnosed with   breast cancer.  Ã¢ÂÂ group pitched in to help, so Montgomery could spend more time with her daughter Ezri, now 10. Ã¢ÂÂWhen you canÃ¢ÂÂt really do much and youÃ¢ÂÂre looking at the dirt on the floor, itÃ¢ÂÂs one more level of stress,Ã¢ÂÂ she said.  Ã¢ÂÂYou have these people that come in, that donÃ¢ÂÂt know you, and Ã¢ÂÂYouÃ¢ÂÂre going to help me with cleaning my house? Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂSingleton Moms has actually changed my whole outlook. They care about you, and theyÃ¢ÂÂre demonstrating their love through their actions.Ã¢ÂÂ I sat down with   to ask her about her work. Below is an edited version of our conversation.   CNN: Tell me about the woman who inspired your work.  :  I grew up with a girl named Michelle Singleton who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 30.  She was a single mother of four children and I was a young mom with two kids. And it was scary. You just want to be there to watch them grow up.   Paying the bills, cleaning her home, making dinner for her kids    all of that became a real struggle. I wanted to make things as easy as possible for her.   So when I would go to the store, IÃ¢ÂÂd grab an extra Tide and extra toilet paper. When I would make my meals for my family, I would double it and bring a meal over to her house.  Once I helped with an electric bill.  I just tried to do those little things that I hoped would relieve her of some stress. About six months after she passed, we got to thinking she couldnÃ¢ÂÂt have been the only one. There were other people like her that needed help.  And thatÃ¢ÂÂs how Singleton Moms was born. CNN: IÃ¢ÂÂd imagine that many people havenÃ¢ÂÂt thought about the struggles of being a single parent with cancer.  How are you able to help?  : We focus on    support    financial assistance, housecleaning, prepared meals, supplies for the home, kidsÃ¢ÂÂ events. ItÃ¢ÂÂs that   mentality of neighbors helping neighbors.  Who doesnÃ¢ÂÂt like a clean house that they didnÃ¢ÂÂt have to clean themselves? We have a team of volunteers that have all been   and they sweep, mop, clean the bathrooms. We even have a couple of volunteers who go way above and beyond and will do laundry and fold clothes.   And so, our parents can come home from chemo, sit on the couch and read a book with their child without having to worry about, Ã¢ÂÂUgh, the bathroom needs to be cleaned.Ã¢ÂÂ  ItÃ¢ÂÂs just to allow them to focus on whatÃ¢ÂÂs important, which is their health and their family.  CNN: Is this work hard for you sometimes, on a personal level?   : About 80% of the parents we support are stage 4, which means that battling cancer is their   job. They will not go back to work and for the rest of their lives, theyÃ¢ÂÂll be in treatment.   ItÃ¢ÂÂs hard.  ItÃ¢ÂÂs a rollercoaster.  IÃ¢ÂÂve had bouts when a certain mom has passed where I didnÃ¢ÂÂt get out of bed for two weeks. And I thought, Ã¢ÂÂWhy am I doing this?Ã¢ÂÂ  But then I come back and remember why.  And so, while Michelle is and always will be our inspiration, there are now so many others that are just as inspirational. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre why I keep doing what I do.   CNN: We should note that name of the organization is no longer entirely accurate.  : WeÃ¢ÂÂre not just about moms    we have dads, too! Not a lot, but if you are a single parent, you need the support.  They tend to even get a little special treatment.  EverybodyÃ¢ÂÂs like, Ã¢ÂÂOh, thereÃ¢ÂÂs a dad here.Ã¢ÂÂ  And so they give them lots of hugs and pay a lot of attention to them.   CNN:  ItÃ¢ÂÂs such a serious subject, but your group seems to have a very fun vibe.  : WeÃ¢ÂÂre very social!  Once a month, all of our families come to pick up their supplies.  We do crafts with the kids, snacks and have a good time.  We like having any event because cancer sucks, and thereÃ¢ÂÂs not a lot of happy that goes with that.   But life does still go on, so itÃ¢ÂÂs really important that these families can just   and have fun. No one can understand what theyÃ¢ÂÂre going through like another single parent with cancer. So giving them the opportunity to meet and support each other is very powerful. Cancer can be so defeating.  ItÃ¢ÂÂs an ugly word and itÃ¢ÂÂs a sad word.  And so, itÃ¢ÂÂs my hope that Singleton Moms can bring joy and say to cancer, Ã¢ÂÂYou canÃ¢ÂÂt defeat us.  We are still going to be strong and weÃ¢ÂÂre going to celebrate life.  And you canÃ¢ÂÂt take that away from us.Ã¢ÂÂ Want to get involved?

2073," (CNN) Tawny Willoughby grew up in   Kentucky, where, she said, it was normal to use a tanning bed four or five times a week.   Ã¢ÂÂI had my own personal tanning bed in my home, and so did a lot of my friends growing up. . .. Everyone tanned,Ã¢ÂÂ Willoughby said. Ã¢ÂÂI didnÃ¢ÂÂt really even think about the future or skin cancer at the time.Ã¢ÂÂ  After one of her classmates in nursing school was diagnosed with melanoma, Willoughby made her first dermatology appointment at age 21.

She goes to the dermatologist every six to 12 months and usually has a cancerous piece of skin removed at each checkup. SheÃ¢ÂÂs become a cautionary tale about the hazards of tanning beds, thanks to a selfie she posted last month on Facebook.

S. each year are linked to indoor tanning. Melanoma is the most common form of cancer for adults   years old and the   common form of cancer for adolescents and young adults   years old, according to the academy.

2074,"Washington (CNN) In a rare joint action with attorneys general for each of the 50 states, the Federal Trade Commission says four cancer charities run by extended members of the same family conned donors out of $187 million from 2008 through 2012 and spent almost nothing to help actual cancer patients. Each of the charities charged were the subject of extensive reporting by CNN in 2013.  And in each instance, none of the four charities would comment. We were ordered out of the building at the Cancer Fund of America in Knoxville, Tennessee, and were the object of an obscene gesture by the CEO of The Breast Cancer Society in Mesa, Arizona. The Cancer Fund of America is run by James Reynolds Sr. His son James Reynolds Jr. is the CEO of the Breast Cancer Society. Another charity, the ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Cancer Fund of America, is run by Rose Perkins, the   of the elder James Reynolds. HeÃ¢ÂÂs also the CEO of the fourth charity, Cancer Support Services. The government says the charities claimed to provide direct support for cancer patients, breast cancer patients and children with cancer. Ã¢ÂÂThese were lies,Ã¢ÂÂ the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs complaint says. Jessica Rich, chief of the FTCÃ¢ÂÂs Bureau of Consumer Protection, says that in all, the charities spent about 97% of donations they received either on private fundraisers or on themselves. Only 3% she says, went to help actual cancer patients. According to the complaint, funds donated to help cancer patients instead went for personal use, in often lavish ways. Ã¢ÂÂ[D]onated funds were used to pay for vehicles, personal consumer goods, college tuition, gym memberships, Jet Ski outings, dating website subscriptions, luxury cruises, and tickets to concerts and professional sporting events,Ã¢ÂÂ the complaint says. Ã¢ÂÂMost of what we are doing is bringing actions against fraud,Ã¢ÂÂ says Rich. Ã¢ÂÂAnd this is as about as bad as it can get: taking money away from cancer victims.Ã¢ÂÂ CNN Investigations: Hidden cameras reveal airport workers stealing, There was also what the FTC calls Ã¢ÂÂrampant nepotismÃ¢ÂÂ at play in all of the charities. For instance, at the Breast Cancer Society, James Reynolds Jr. hired his wife, Kristina Hixson, to be his public relations manager. The complaint states that he also hired HixsonÃ¢ÂÂs two sisters, her son by a previous marriage, her mother and her  . According to the complaint, HixsonÃ¢ÂÂs mother had been a caterer. At the Breast Cancer Society, she was hired to write grant applications.  Moreover, on their tax returns, each charity claimed millions of dollars in donated goods shipped to overseas locations on behalf of cancer patients. The complaint says the charities never owned any of the goods in question and simply paid a fee to a private firm in South Carolina to ship the goods, called   . CNN went to Guatemala in early 2014 to investigate anyone who may have received those gifts and could find no evidence that they even existed. As a result of the complaint, two of the charities say they will close their doors. Both the Breast Cancer Society and the ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Cancer Fund of America are being dissolved, according to the complaint. James Reynolds Jr. faces a judgment of more than $60 million in fines and Rose Perkins, who runs the ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Cancer Fund of America, faces a judgment of around $30 million.   Under a proposed final order, the judgment against Reynolds Jr. will be suspended when he pays $75, 000. The judgments against ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Cancer Fund of America will be partly met upon liquidation of its assets, and the judgment against Perkins will be suspended due to her inability to pay.  CNN Investigations: Many airport workers not screened, The FTCÃ¢ÂÂs Jessica Rich, however, said there are few assets left. Government regulators will be lucky to recover $1 million, she told CNN. As for James Reynolds Sr. he will contest the charges in the complaint, the government says. CNN hasnÃ¢ÂÂt yet been able to reach attorneys for Reynolds Sr. his son or Perkins for comment, but in a message posted on the Breast Cancer Society website, Reynolds Jr. said: Ã¢ÂÂWhile the organization, its officers and directors have not been found guilty of any allegations of wrong doing, and the government has not proven otherwise, our Board of Directors has decided that it does not help those who we seek to serve, and those who remain in need, for us to engage in a highly publicized, expensive, and distracting legal battle around our fundraising practices.Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,Government says four cancer charities are shams,2074.0,2074.0,74.0,
2075," (CNN) Cheryl Mauthe is hoping that 2015 is the year when good things begin again.  In 2012, her    son, Colin, was diagnosed with leukemia. That same year, her father died from ALS. In 2013, her house flooded and the family lost everything in the basement. And in 2014, the single mother of two was diagnosed with breast cancer. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs when Tim Smith, a photojournalist for the Brandon Sun in Brandon, Manitoba, asked if he could document the familyÃ¢ÂÂs story.   Smith had captured images of Colin during a blood drive at his school in 2012. And now, Cheryl was entering an impossible journey on her own.  Cheryl thought that it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt possible for both her and Colin to make it through cancer alive, but she hoped that her son would be the one to survive. Allowing Smith to take photos would ensure that the family was in photos together    that her children could remember her through the images and know that she fought to beat cancer and be there for them.  Smith gained CherylÃ¢ÂÂs trust and began to visit regularly. He was there for the appointments, the treatments, the surgeries    and the very worst days after those treatments when Cheryl was in the kind of pain that she can only describe as Ã¢ÂÂ .Ã¢ÂÂ Colin and Cheryl were both enduring chemotherapy while her daughter, Emily, felt left out because she didnÃ¢ÂÂt have cancer, too.

Ã¢ÂÂWe focused on the little moments and what made us happy: going to the zoo, the fair, birthday parties. ItÃ¢ÂÂs hard to find the good when youÃ¢ÂÂre surrounded by tragedy, but when you have two children looking up to you, you forget all of your pain and stress. They deserve the best mom possible, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what I tried to do.Ã¢ÂÂ Cheryl had tried her hardest to make ColinÃ¢ÂÂs leukemia navigable. By using pamphlets from the cancer care center, they had educated the teachers and children in his school about what Colin was enduring    and in turn, he became the school rock star rather than an outcast.  In a rare moment, as her hair, eyelashes and eyebrows began to disappear after the chemotherapy, Cheryl caught herself looking in the mirror and tearing up.  Ã¢ÂÂMom, youÃ¢ÂÂre still beautiful,Ã¢ÂÂ Colin said to his mother.  While Cheryl could keep up a positive face for the kids, it was at night, when she was alone in her room with no one to tell her that everything would be alright, that she feared breaking down. As a single mother, she said, breaking down is one of the hardest things because thereÃ¢ÂÂs no one to help pick you back up again.  But Cheryl was surrounded by close friends who didnÃ¢ÂÂt desert her. They cooked meals for her, made sure her lawn was maintained and provided her with infinite encouragement. Even Smith, with his regular presence in their lives, became a positive support system who never lost his optimism.  Ã¢ÂÂI find myself surprised at how much can be thrown at one person, or one family, and see them stay so positive through the majority of it all,Ã¢ÂÂ Smith said. Ã¢ÂÂOn the surface, it seems so devastating. But I found those   moments that showed their happiness as a family.Ã¢ÂÂ Cheryl has fought through moments made difficult by her illness, like getting her kids dressed and ready for school when the slightest pressure on her fingertips made her feel like she was on fire. But a lot of her worry was directed toward Colin and the dangers that his leukemia presented. ColinÃ¢ÂÂs friends disinfect their hands before playing with him because his immune system is so compromised. When Cheryl brushes his teeth, they have to be careful with his gums if ColinÃ¢ÂÂs gums bleed, he could get an infection that could halt his chemotherapy.  There were days that Cheryl didnÃ¢ÂÂt want Smith and his camera around. In turn, Smith tried to be present, like a fly on the wall, without feeling invasive during such personal moments. This dedication to documenting the family allowed him to glimpse the happier moments as well. And Cheryl is grateful to see those moments frozen in time    bright smiles and laughter amid the tears and tangible pain. Together, the series presents an   portrait of strength, love and endurance in the best and worst of times.  Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs a huge blessing to see yourself through someone elseÃ¢ÂÂs eyes,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂNow, we can step back and look at that year. IÃ¢ÂÂm so proud of who weÃ¢ÂÂve become. My kids have handled every moment with grace and dignity.Ã¢ÂÂ Even with all of the pain, 2015 has brought good news to the family: Cheryl has been declared   and Colin will hopefully be cleared of his leukemia by October. Both of them will have regular,   appointments to make sure that the cancer doesnÃ¢ÂÂt return    Cheryl is especially at risk. She still has one more reconstructive surgery, but it wonÃ¢ÂÂt stop her from returning to work for the first time in a long while. SheÃ¢ÂÂs working toward a future for her family that establishes yet another new sense of normal    where she can return to work, live with no pain and take her kids on a   vacation.  Smith, now like a part of the family, keeps closely in touch with Cheryl and her kids. He hopes to be in the room when Colin is cleared of leukemia. Documenting their story has left an impression on him.  Ã¢ÂÂYou appreciate what you have,Ã¢ÂÂ Smith said. Ã¢ÂÂIt made me realize that I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to live my whole life through the lens. I want to stop and enjoy life with my family, too.Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,"Mother, son both fighting cancer",2075.0,2075.0,75.0,
2076," (CNN) Researchers meeting in Chicago are hailing what they believe may be a potent new weapon in the fight against cancer: the bodyÃ¢ÂÂs own immune system. An international study found that a combination of two drugs that helped allow the immune system to fight the cancer    ipilimumab and nivolumab    stopped the deadly skin cancer melanoma from advancing for nearly a year in 58% of the cases.  Melanoma, though a skin cancer, can spread to the lungs, liver, bone, lymph nodes and brain. The study was designed and led by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Other studies have shown promise in treating lung cancer. The research is being presented in Chicago at the annual conference of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Those involved in the fight against cancer are divided as to just how excited to get over the promise of immunotherapy in battling cancer.  Results Ã¢ÂÂencouraging,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂpromisingÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂImmunotherapy drugs have already revolutionized melanoma treatment, and now weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing how they might be even more powerful when theyÃ¢ÂÂre combined,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Steven OÃ¢ÂÂDay, an expert with the American Society of Clinical Oncology.  Ã¢ÂÂBut the results also warrant caution    the nivolumab and ipilimumab combination used in this study came with greater side effects, which might offset its benefits for some patients. Physicians and patients will need to weigh these considerations carefully,Ã¢ÂÂ OÃ¢ÂÂDay said. In the study, 36% of the patients receiving the   combination had to stop the therapy due to side effects. Both drugs are made by   Squibb, the sponsors of the study. And Nell Barrie, a spokeswoman for Cancer Research UK, while calling the results Ã¢ÂÂencouragingÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂpromising,Ã¢ÂÂ told CNN that much remains to be learned and the new drugs would not replace any of the existing cancer treatments. Surgery, she said, would remain vital. So, too, would chemotherapy and radiotherapy, she said.  She noted that researchers had yet to study the   survival rates for immunotherapy. And the side effects can include inflammation of the stomach and bowel serious enough to require hospitalization, she  said.  But Dr. James Larkin, the lead author of the melanoma study, called the results a game changer. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂve seen these drugs working in a wide range of cancers, and I think we are at the beginning of a new era in treating cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ Larkin told The Telegraph, a British newspaper. Ã¢ÂÂAnother weapon in the arsenalÃ¢ÂÂ Barrie said immunotherapy could offer hope to people with cancers that are otherwise difficult to treat, such as melanoma, advanced lung cancer or cancer that has spread throughout the body. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre looking at another weapon in the arsenal,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. At the heart of immunotherapy is that cancer    unlike most other diseases    is not an invader. It consists instead of the bodyÃ¢ÂÂs own cells gone rogue. So the immune system is not programmed to target the cancerous cells because it does not recognize them as foreign. The immunotherapy drugs, Barrie said, Ã¢ÂÂwork to switch the immune system back on.Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,Immunotherapy shows promise in fighting cancer,2076.0,2076.0,76.0,

Ã¢ÂÂThere is currently very little evidence to counsel men living with prostate cancer on how they can modify their lifestyle to improve survival,Ã¢ÂÂ said Jorge Chavarro, the studyÃ¢ÂÂs senior author. Ã¢ÂÂOur results suggest that a   diet may benefit these men by specifically reducing their chances of dying of prostate cancer.Ã¢ÂÂ  Chavarro and fellow researchers from Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health interviewed 926 men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer about their dietary habits over a   period. Prostate cancer is frequently   and nonaggressive and therefore has one of the highest survival rates of any type of cancer.  Two types of eating habits emerged: a Ã¢ÂÂprudentÃ¢ÂÂ pattern that included a high intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and beans and other legumes, and a Western pattern made up of processed and red meats,   dairy and refined grains such as often used in processed foods. The study then followed the men over another 10 years to see how they did. They found men who ate mostly a Western diet of processed and   foods had a 2ÃÂ½ times greater risk of dying from prostate cancer as well as a 67% higher risk of death overall. Men who were Ã¢ÂÂprudentÃ¢ÂÂ in their food choices had a 36% lower risk of dying from any cause. Related: Mediterranean diet leads to long life, Eating less processed foods, more fruits, veggies and lean meat and fish are cornerstones of   diets, such as the Mediterranean diet. These diets have a long history of benefits in the scientific world. This is one of the first studies to look at the benefits for prostate cancer. Even though the study followed men over a long period of time, the authors point out some limitations: They did not collect data on   diets of the men, didnÃ¢ÂÂt track physical activity, and most of the 926 participants were white physicians, which might skew results. Ã¢ÂÂTherefore it is very important that our results are replicated in other studies with more diverse socioeconomic and   backgrounds,Ã¢ÂÂ lead author Meng Yang said.",cancer,Study: High-fat diet increases risk of prostate cancer,2077.0,2077.0,77.0,

2079," (CNN) A   doctor who authorities say gave cancer treatment drugs to patients who did not need them     including some who didnÃ¢ÂÂt actually have cancer    was sentenced  Friday to 45 years in prison. Dr. Farid Fata, 50, pleaded guilty in September to giving cancer treatments to misdiagnosed patients, telling some they had a terminal blood cancer called multiple myeloma. He pleaded guilty to 13 counts of Medicare fraud, one count of conspiracy to pay or receive kickbacks and two counts of money laundering.                    Federal prosecutors called him the Ã¢ÂÂmost egregious fraudster in the history of this country.Ã¢ÂÂ To Fata, they said, Ã¢ÂÂpatients were not people. They were profit centers.Ã¢ÂÂ Fata forfeited $17. 6 million that he collected from Medicare and private insurance companies. Some 553 patients received medically unnecessary infusions or injections, prosecutors said. The   gave an emotional apology in court, saying he was Ã¢ÂÂashamedÃ¢ÂÂ of his actions. Ã¢ÂÂI have violated the Hippocratic oath and violated the trust of my patients,Ã¢ÂÂ Fata said, according to CNN affiliate WDIV. Ã¢ÂÂI do not know how I can heal the wound. I do not know how to express the sorrow and the shame.Ã¢ÂÂ But to the dozens of FataÃ¢ÂÂs victims who filed into U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan throughout the week to watch his sentencing, his apology doesnÃ¢ÂÂt matter. Many will live with the effects of his, at times, unnecessary treatments, for the rest of their lives. As Geraldine Parkin, the wife of one former patient said in court, many were Ã¢ÂÂtortured until their last breaths.Ã¢ÂÂ Treated, but not sick, Robert Sobieray went to Fata and was given chemotherapy treatments for two and a half years. But he never had cancer. Ã¢ÂÂIt just gets to me,Ã¢ÂÂ Sobieray said. Ã¢ÂÂWhat was the motivation? Why, why me? I donÃ¢ÂÂt know what did I ever do to him.Ã¢ÂÂ The chemotherapy treatments were painful, and made him physically sick. They were so strong that his teeth fell out and his jaw started to change shape. Years after finding out he didnÃ¢ÂÂt have cancer, he has lost all but one of his teeth. Ã¢ÂÂWith all the bills piling up, I canÃ¢ÂÂt afford to get new teeth,Ã¢ÂÂ Sobieray said. Ã¢ÂÂ(I) would like to eat a good meal again someday. Like salad, used to love eating salad. I canÃ¢ÂÂt eat that anymore. A lot of things I love I canÃ¢ÂÂt eat anymore.Ã¢ÂÂ Patty Hester went to Fata in 2010 after being recommended by another doctor. Her white blood cell counts were low, and Fata was a renowned hematologist and oncologist. Ã¢ÂÂHe was, according to the web page, and according to the fliers, heÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ Hester said. Ã¢ÂÂWhen you went in his office, he was top doc.Ã¢ÂÂ Hester, who worked in an emergency room at the time, was devastated when Fata told her she had myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Ã¢ÂÂHe said, Ã¢ÂÂYou need to start on chemo, like, immediately,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Hester recalled. She was in disbelief. And after debating with Fata, he instead put her on iron treatments and, eventually, blood plasma treatments. She was still taking those pricey plasma treatments the day   made her come to the TV and see the news: her doctor had been arrested. Hester did not have cancer. Ã¢ÂÂTook full advantage of my trust Ã¢ÂÂ Some of FataÃ¢ÂÂs patients did have various forms of cancer. Chris Sneary faced Fata for the first time since his former doctorÃ¢ÂÂs arrest on Tuesday as he read his victim impact statement in court. He turned to glance at Fata, took a deep breath and read his story. Sneary came to Fata to be treated for testicular cancer from 2010 to 2013. He had 40 days of chemotherapy, 14 days of hydration therapy and dozens of other treatments and procedures. Ã¢ÂÂI gave full and total trust to this man to get me and my family through this journey I was about to begin,Ã¢ÂÂ Sneary said. Sneary discovered after FataÃ¢ÂÂs arrest that heÃ¢ÂÂd been given Ã¢ÂÂgross overtreatmentÃ¢ÂÂ    more expensive and harsh chemotherapy than was necessary and, worse, he had a testicle removed that was medically unnecessary. Ã¢ÂÂDr. Fata took full advantage of my trust in him, my fear of dying and, most of all, my top of the line health insurance,Ã¢ÂÂ Sneary said, at times fighting back tears in court. And one patient who did have cancer spoke out in court posthumously. Donald CrabtreeÃ¢ÂÂs wife, Marietta, read a statement he wrote back in December last year, before he passed away. Ã¢ÂÂNone of the tumors were helped    they increased in number, they increased in size,Ã¢ÂÂ Crabtree read in court. Ã¢ÂÂI believe Dr. Fata knowingly and purposely treated me for the wrong cancer and gave me the wrong chemotherapy.Ã¢ÂÂ Crabtree said it was his dying wish for Fata to spend the rest of his life in prison. Fata apologizes to patients, Before being sentenced, Fata turned to face those who were at his sentencing and apologized. Ã¢ÂÂThe quest for power is Ã¢ÂÂ he said, according to WDIV. Ã¢ÂÂThey came to me seeking compassion and care. I failed. Yes, I failed.Ã¢ÂÂ Now some of his former patients have a chance to file claims and possibly be awarded some of the funds that he collected from Medicare and insurance companies. Fata is expected to serve at least 34 years of his sentence, possibly at a   prison in Michigan.

Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Biden is currently raising money to continue the Moonshot   TaskforceÃ¢ÂÂs work and, while private philanthropy is important, he   said on Sunday that federal budgets for research are even   more important. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂBillions and billions of dollars [for research] comes from tax   payers. Your government, that many of you donÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂt like, is the   vehicle of how this [curing cancer] gets done,Ã¢ÂÂ Biden told the   crowd. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   As such, Biden vowed to work with the Trump Administration   to continue the fight against cancer.  Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm confident we can get through it.

I promise to do   everything in my power to work with new organization to end   cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ Biden said. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   During the SXSW speech, Biden relayed how he became the leader of   the Moonshot Task Cancer (paraphrased): Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   While the federal government has taken on cancer before  Ã¢ÂÂ   most   notable in 1971, under President Nixon  Ã¢ÂÂ   Biden said that he felt   that by Ã¢ÂÂinjecting an overwhelming sense of urgency,Ã¢ÂÂ he and   others could change the how we fight cancer.

2082,"Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   WeÃ¢ÂÂre starting to get a clearer picture of some of the   consequences of cancer immunotherapy, a new area of   therapies that harness the bodyÃ¢ÂÂs immune system to take on cancer   cells.  Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   The drugs have generated a lot of excitement for the   revolutionary way they treat cancer. The drugs donÃ¢ÂÂt have the   same side effects as chemotherapy, and in cases   like  Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   But now, as more data comes out and newer waves of drugs get   closer to approval, that excitement is starting to get tempered   in the face of deadly side effects and failed trials.  Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   The first wave of these treatments are called checkpoint   inhibitors. Most people have a type of protein that stops their   immune systems from fighting the cancerous cells. These   checkpoint inhibitors block those proteins. ItÃ¢ÂÂs like taking   down a guard tower, allowing the bodyÃ¢ÂÂs own immune system to   flood past a barrier, where it then gets to work killing and   clearing away the cancer cells. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Checkpoint inhibitors were first approved to treat melanoma but   have since gone on to tackle lung cancer, bladder cancer, blood   cancers, and other cancers. There are now six approved .  Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   But theyÃ¢ÂÂre far from perfect.  could be . Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Now, a second wave of cancer immunotherapy is facing some   challenges.  Short for Ã¢ÂÂchimeric antigen   receptorÃ¢ÂÂ   therapy, the treatment takes a personÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂs own   cells, takes them out of the body, reengineers them, then puts   the cells back in the body where they can attack a particular   cancer cell. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   But on Monday,  while in a   clinical trial for its     therapy from cerebral   edema, a condition in which the brain swells up because of   excessive fluid in the brain. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not the first time these   therapies have experienced that severe side effect. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   In July, another   company, Juno Therapeutics, said four   people in its  all from cerebral edema. ItÃ¢ÂÂs   dampened the excitement that people once had for the   therapy.  Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   The   therapies are Ã¢ÂÂassassins,Ã¢ÂÂ  That makes them a really powerful weapon, he   said, but that can be good and bad depending on whether itÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂs   hitting the intended cancer target or accidentally affecting   other parts of the body. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Gritstone is working on another type of cancer immunotherapy   called cancer vaccines that wants to help amplify the bodyÃ¢ÂÂs   immune system to fight off cancer cells. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Even with the deaths that have been reported, there still could   be an upside to treating some patients with the drug even if   there are deadly risks attached.  Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂI feel there is a long way to go. And ultimately if in many   cases itÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂs curing patients, we have to take the risk and   then manage the benefits,Ã¢ÂÂ Roman Yelensky, chief technology   officer at Gritstone Oncology, told Business Insider.  Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Kelly Page, TakedaÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂs vice president of strategic planning in   oncology, said this isnÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂt all too different from the speed bumps   the first immunotherapies (namely the checkpoint inhibitors)   experienced when they first hit the field. Ã¢ÂÂThey were   technologies before their time,Ã¢ÂÂ she said.

2083,"Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂCatching cancer early is an incredible challenge, but a new way to detect it in the blood may totally revolutionize cancer treatment in just a few years.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ the $25 billion maker of gene sequencing technology, has created a new company to invent a blood test to detect all cancers in their early stages, something that would be a tremendous help to those trying to detect the illness before it is too difficult to treat effectively.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThis isnÃ¢ÂÂt the first attempt of this nature, and previous efforts by other companies have been criticized for having too little research behind them or focusing too much on detection rather than treatment. Crucially, this blood test does not exist yet, and while scientists will be working furiously to try to make it happen, it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean they will succeed.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂBut this latest bet is one of the   with a number of illustrious scientists already involved  Ã¢ÂÂ   and IlluminaÃ¢ÂÂs backing may give it a crucial boost.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThe new company, called Grail (as in, itÃ¢ÂÂs trying to achieve something considered the Holy Grail for cancer researchers) hopes to have a   blood test by 2019, an extremely ambitious goal. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThat would mean that anyone could add such a test onto their annual physical  Ã¢ÂÂ   no need for separate tests for different types of lung cancer, prostate cancer, or any other form of the illness.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂGrail is launching with $100 million in Series A financing, backed by Illumina, Bill Gates, Sutter Hill Ventures, and Jeff BezosÃ¢ÂÂ Bezos Expeditions. Illumina and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center are partnering to help launch a study to see if GrailÃ¢ÂÂs test can actually do what they hope it will do.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂWe look forward to a day in the not too distant future where there would be a simple blood test for every form of cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Richard Klausner, former director of the National Cancer Institute and a board member of Grail, said on a press call on Sunday.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThe key to this effort is the ability to detect whatÃ¢ÂÂs known as circulating tumor DNA, or CTDNA. In recent years, doctors have discovered that the genetic material from cancerous tumors starts circulating in our bodies.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂs abundantly clear that these molecules are in the blood,Ã¢ÂÂ Illumina CEO Jay Flatley said on the call.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂSo, along with Memorial Sloan Kettering, Grail plans on following hundreds of thousands of patients over the next few years and trying to see if they can detect CTDNA in those patients whenever they develop cancer.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThat research will be crucial: An earlier effort by another company, Pathway Genomics, to create a Ã¢ÂÂliquid biopsyÃ¢ÂÂ for cancer was greeted in September by  from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning that the agency had Ã¢ÂÂnot found any published evidence that this test or any similar test has been clinically validated as a screening tool for early detection of cancer in high risk individuals. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂFlatley is well aware of the minefield Grail is entering. Ã¢ÂÂIf you look at this business, itÃ¢ÂÂs littered with failures. With a few exceptions, screening tests have been invariably horrible,Ã¢ÂÂ he . Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs a big challenge. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂIf GrailÃ¢ÂÂs trials show its test can detect stage 2 cancer, Flatley says the market value of those tests could be from $20 to $40 billion. If CTDNA can accurately identify stage 1 cancers, that would give them a $100 billion value, according to Flatley.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂDoing something like this does also comes with risks for overdiagnosis, even if the research is successful; a regular test for cancer risks causing many people to receive potentially dangerous treatment for cancers that wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt have seriously impacted their health in the long run, according to JosÃÂ© Baselga,    and Chief Medical Officer of Memorial Sloan Kettering.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂBut the ways that CTDNA screening could work, and the opportunities that screening creates for early treatment, could revolutionize cancer treatment in ways that Ã¢ÂÂcannot be overemphasized,Ã¢ÂÂ according to Baselga.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂWe must diagnose cancer earlier,Ã¢ÂÂ he says.Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,Illumina is teaming up with Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos to develop a new kind of cancer test,2083.0,2083.0,83.0,
2084,"Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂJeff Huber spent over a decade  helping Google launch some of its biggest projects  Ã¢ÂÂ   from its ad platform to Google Maps.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThis week, he left the company to take on a more personal challenge: developing test for cancer at the earliest possible stage.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂHuber was just named  which was created last month by   giant Illumina and a group of including Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂGrail also now has the backing of Google Ventures, it said when announcing HuberÃ¢ÂÂs appointment on Wednesday.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂHuber spoke with Business Insider about his reasons for joining Grail, the companyÃ¢ÂÂs plans to conduct the biggest ever clinical trial, his most recent stint at Google X, the companyÃ¢ÂÂs research unit, and his personal experience with the disease. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂHuber started his tenure at Google working to build its ad platform. From there, he went on to work on everything from Google Apps to Google Maps. After he hit the   mark, he started to think about what he wanted to do next and realized that working at that intersection of biology and technology was going to be his next step.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂAs I thought about what I wanted to do next at Google, it seemed to me like biology and science was having a pretty fundamental shift,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂHuber was most recently a senior vice president at Google X, where he spent time bringing big data and analytics to biology. He also served on IlluminaÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂs board for the last two years, where he felt the ethical imperative of what the companyÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂs been doing with its Ã¢ÂÂ  sequencingÃ¢ÂÂ research.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂDNA sequencing is a process in which researchers can break down DNA into its most basic building blocks, which they can then analyze to inform everything from where your ancestors came from to what diseases you might be predisposed to. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂHuberÃ¢ÂÂs motives are also deeply personal. His wife died last year of   cancer. A screening test that could diagnose her disease early on might have changed the course of her life.  Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂEvery day we donÃ¢ÂÂt have a test available, lives are being lost,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. So, GrailÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂs plan is to move with Ã¢ÂÂ  speed,Ã¢ÂÂ balanced by science and quality results.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂMoving at   speed as a healthcare company has to be taken with some caution: If the excitement around a certain idea moves faster than the science, it could have some serious  Ã¢ÂÂ   possibly even deadly  Ã¢ÂÂ   consequences. But, if GrailÃ¢ÂÂs able to pull off the scientific validation at the same time, it could be astonishing to see. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂHuberÃ¢ÂÂs first task is going to be to build a team that can take on the seemingly impossible task of developing a universal   test. His 12 years of working at the  in the world, have taught him a lot about how important a   workplace is. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂGoogle did a great job of recognizing importance of having a great team going after the big challenges,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre putting together best team of scientists with the best understanding of cancer biology, the best big data and informatics and build the infrastructure it takes to do this,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.  Ã¢ÂÂThat way we can see the patterns, correlations, data that will then feed the predictions and hypotheses and give us a better understanding of cancer biology. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThe idea behind a   test is to identify the tiny bits of cancer DNA that are hanging out in our blood but currently undetectable. If Grail is successful, itÃ¢ÂÂll be the first to pull off a   blood test that works proactively. The concept is similar to liquid biopsy tests, which use  to sequences genetic information in that blood to figure out how tumors are responding to a certain cancer therapy.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂWith one simple blood draw, GrailÃ¢ÂÂs plan is to sequence and screen for those bits with the hope that it will help catch cancer before it starts to be a   problem. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs been a team of about 30 working within Illumina laying out the groundwork for the test for at least a year, and the group officially received their Grail job offers last week.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂFor the next two years, the focus will be on optimizing the technology of the test thatÃ¢ÂÂs in the making. GrailÃ¢ÂÂs working with health systems and research institutions like Memorial Sloan Kettering to do this.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂOnce they work out the kinks, Huber expects to do the   clinical trial to see how the cancer screening works in practice  Ã¢ÂÂ   thereÃ¢ÂÂs nothing more frightening than the thought of a misdiagnosis for cancer. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThat is going to be three or four years away, he said. If it means running the screen on millions of people and waiting to see if the test proved accurate, Grail is many more years away from reaching its goal, even at Ã¢ÂÂ . Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThis timeline is a point that Huber is keen to remind people of. He does this by pointing out his start date: February 29. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂI think starting on Leap Day underscores   mission we have,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Because, get it?

2085,"Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂA  from two major research groups just linked processed meat  Ã¢ÂÂ   including everyoneÃ¢ÂÂs favorite, bacon  Ã¢ÂÂ   to cancer.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂIf this story sounds familiar, then thatÃ¢ÂÂs because it is.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂJust last October, the World Health Organization  concluding that eating processed meats was linked with a higher risk of developing  a specific type of the disease that begins in the colon or rectum.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThis new report looks even worse for AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs favorite breakfast meat.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂIn it, the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) and the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) find links between eating processed meat and developing cancer of the lower stomach.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThe links are creepily similar to those found in the previous WHO report on colorectal cancer and processed meat.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂIn fact, the researchers found the same risk factor  Ã¢ÂÂ   down to the gram and percentage  Ã¢ÂÂ   for eating processed meat and developing   cancer as the WHO had found for eating processed meat and developing colorectal cancer.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂHereÃ¢ÂÂs a quote from the  on stomach cancer:Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂAnd hereÃ¢ÂÂs the  and  on colorectal cancer:Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂAccording to Dr. Susan Higginbotham, AICRÃ¢ÂÂs vice president of research, thatÃ¢ÂÂs purely coincidental, as both reports used different publications and did different analyses. And we need to keep in mind that, at the end of the day, these estimates are just ballpark figures. They donÃ¢ÂÂt tell us precisely what is causing disease or how it happens in the body.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂCancer is complicated. ItÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂs kind of showing thereÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂs an increase in risk and we have ideas about why it might be happening, but weÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂre not sure. And the fact that itÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂs happening in more than one cancer is definitely interesting,Ã¢ÂÂ Higginbotham told Business Insider.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂIn other words, this is bad news for bacon.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂStill, Higginbotham warns, you shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt go banning the ingredient just yet. While these numbers are certainly scary, the situation is probably nowhere near as bad as you think. It doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean, for example, that for every piece of bacon you consume youÃ¢ÂÂre drastically jacking up your chances of getting colorectal or   cancer.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂLetÃ¢ÂÂs try comparing theoretical you with two of your theoretical friends: Susie and Fred.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂSusie is practically vegetarian. SheÃ¢ÂÂs completely sworn off hot dogs and smoked ham, but she maybe indulges in a few pieces of bacon every month. You, on the other hand, make a mean   BLT and have been known to occasionally indulge in a hot dog at a baseball game.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThen thereÃ¢ÂÂs Fred. He fries up a few pieces of bacon for breakfast every day, eats a pastrami sandwich for lunch a few times a week, and typically has ham for dinner.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂGenetics and environmental factors aside, you and Susie are at a pretty low risk of developing colorectal or   cancer as a strict result of your eating habits, at least according to these two reports. Neither of you is indulging in the equivalent of a hot dog or a serving of pastrami each day. Reminder: One daily hot dog or its equivalent was the amount of processed meat the study found to be linked with an 18% increased risk of the two cancers.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂFor Fred, itÃ¢ÂÂs a different story. HeÃ¢ÂÂs eating plenty more than the equivalent of a single hot dog each day, and, based on this research, is more likely to develop one of these two cancer types over his lifetime than you or Susie.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂLest you begin having flashbacks to the terrifying  which compared noshing on a few strips of delicious bacon with smoking cigarettes, the two are not equally unhealthy.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThe  an international research group, estimates that roughly  per year across the globe can be attributed to diets high in processed meats like bacon.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂOn the other hand, close to as much as 29 times that amount  Ã¢ÂÂ   1 million people  Ã¢ÂÂ   die of cancer every year from smoking tobacco.

2087,"Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   The world of cancer treatments is an explosive area, especially   as treatments get more targeted. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   But with that will come some big costs. The IMS Institute for   Healthcare Informatics expects cancer treatment costs to hit $150   billion by 2020, up from $107 billion in 2015. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Enter a new potential side effect: debilitating cost. How do   doctors and researchers factor in the costs that a patient is   paying? Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the kind of thing Dr. Derek Raghavan, president of Levine   Cancer Institute at Carolinas HealthCare, thinks about a lot. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂWe are spending more and more time thinking about cost for   patients,Ã¢ÂÂ he told Business Insider. He pointed to a study by    Dr. Jonas de Souza who uses   the term Ã¢ÂÂfinancial toxicityÃ¢ÂÂ to look at how much of a role   finances play in a cancer patientÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂs quality of life. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Cancer isnÃ¢ÂÂt just one disease: ItÃ¢ÂÂs a whole group of cancers.   ItÃ¢ÂÂs gotten so big that whole companies are devoted to developing   cancer treatments. IMS cites more than 500 companies that are   developing cancer drugs. In fact, pharmaceutical company Novartis   just split out its oncology business into a separate branch from   its other disease areas. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   And because itÃ¢ÂÂs so complex, thereÃ¢ÂÂs a whole web of     that needs to happen as cancer progress, while at   the same time, newer drugs become more targeted and more   specific. HereÃ¢ÂÂs how leading cancer researchers and   pharmaceutical executives are addressing it all. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Raghavan said there are two main questions he thinks about when   determining how to treat a cancer patient. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂThe first question is how much survival benefit will you   get from the patient?Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂThree weeks? Not worth   it. Three months, maybe. But probably not. If youÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂre talking a   year plus, thatÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂs a relatively easy one to solve.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   But that three months gets a little complicated if it means there   arenÃ¢ÂÂt any extreme side effects (either physical or breaking the   bank). If that three months means seeing a major life event, like   a holiday or graduation, itÃ¢ÂÂs likely worth it. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂEverything is contextual. If youÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂre dealing with an      whoÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂs had a stroke and a coronary, and you can do something   thatÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂs going to make them really sick, but will give them an   extra three months, youÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂd have to be an idiot to say thatÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂs worth   it to them,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂBut you also have to ask them:   WhatÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂs important to them?Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Newer treatments, including the   field of   immunotherapy (drugs that harness the immune system to better   attack cancer cells) are seeing much better and longer survival   rates, which is also where costs will factor in. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Within immunotherapy, researchers are trying to figure out how to   get more people to respond to treatment. Take Keytruda, the drug   thatÃ¢ÂÂs credited with helping get  after he was diagnosed   with melanoma that had spread to his liver and brain. Only about   30% of   patients using Keytruda alone respond   completely. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs still better than the  of chemotherapy treatments on their own in   cases of metastatic melanoma, but itÃ¢ÂÂs not 100%. However,   companies think the solution may lie somewhere in combination   with other drugs, potentially even other immunotherapies. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   But the problem is these drugs can often be upward of  depending on how long you   stay on the drug. Add that to another $100, 000 drug, and the cost   for such good results is a bit staggering. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Trials are already being run for combinations of two and even   three immunotherapies at the same time. Beyond that, companies   are looking at ways to pair drugs together to help them work   better. For example, ones that target the programmed cell death 1   (or  ) receptor to essentially take the Ã¢ÂÂfoot off the brake   pedalÃ¢ÂÂ in the immune system might be put together with other   immunotherapies that activate the immune system in different   ways. Or, those   inhibitors might be matched up with targeted   chemotherapies, or other tools in the   toolbox. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Pfizer, which has a number of immunotherapy compounds in   development and a partnership with Merck KGaA to develop the     drug avelumab, said it plans to work closely with other   areas of healthcare to set prices on combinations based on how   well they work. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂI think that the concern thatÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂs being raised time and time again   is more about the future and around combinations,Ã¢ÂÂ PfizerÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂs   global president of oncology Liz Barrett told Business Insider.   Ã¢ÂÂAnd I think when you start to think about that, thatÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂs where I   feel like PfizerÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂs in a unique position, because we have the   multiple   drugs and the targeted therapy drugs.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Before companies even get to that pricing question, there are a   lot of unknowns still left in the immunotherapy world. Merck   & Co. the company that makes Keytruda, thinks a solution   lies in answering the question about where combinations are   necessary, and where drugs like Keytruda can work the best on its   own. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂWe know for some patients, just single application or single   modality treatment with a   antibody is enough,Ã¢ÂÂ the companyÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂs   senior vice president of clinical development, Roy Baynes, told   Business Insider. But for those who donÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂt, there are a few   questions he pinpointed that need to be answered next: Ã¢ÂÂCan we   identify the group that is most likely to benefit from     therapy? Next, who needs a combination and can we   identify which combination?Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   Ideally, the clinical trials that are ongoing or in the works   will give researchers some hints as to what those answers may be.

2091,"Five years ago, on Charlie RyanÃ¢ÂÂs second birthday, a big lump mysteriously formed on the side of his abdomen. At the emergency room his parents took him to, doctors suggested the lump was a hernia caused by some unknown trauma, and referred the family to a surgeon. The surgeon told them it was a benign tumor, and sent them home. Charlie already had a host of medical issues. HeÃ¢ÂÂd been born with an abnormally large head and other features of autism, including being nonverbal. Now this. Like many a baffled and worried parent, his mother, Autumn Ryan, turned to Google, typing in CharlieÃ¢ÂÂs ailments and coming up with a possible cause: a mutation in PTEN, a gene that reins in cell growth. Further searching led her to websites dedicated to families whose children have PTEN mutations. It all looked familiar Ã¢ÂÂ  and worrisome. Ã¢ÂÂI read stories of little boys who havenÃ¢ÂÂt lived, descriptions of these children with a multitude of bumps all over their bodies,Ã¢ÂÂ Ryan recalls. Ã¢ÂÂI was freaked out. Ã¢ÂÂ Two years later, after visits to multiple doctors and the nine months it took for his genetic test to be analyzed, her hunch proved right. Charlie has a mutation in PTEN. Ryan immediately faxed the results to Charis Eng, a PTEN expert at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, whose name she had come across in her research. A few months later, the family made their first trip from their home in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to see Eng and her colleague, autism expert Thomas Frazier. Together, Eng and Frazier have treated more than two dozen children like Charlie Ã¢ÂÂ  who all have PTEN mutations, autism, and large heads. In Eng, Ryan finally found someone who understood CharlieÃ¢ÂÂs condition. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs like going to the person who has all the knowledge in the world, and you can ask her any question,Ã¢ÂÂ Ryan says of Eng. Eng was first and foremost a cancer geneticist, and stumbled upon   autism through her work in that field. In 1997, she discovered the genetic root of Cowden syndrome, a rare condition characterized by   growths and a high lifetime risk of many cancers. Following people with the syndrome, as well as their unaffected family members, she noticed that a few relatives of people with Cowden syndrome have an autism diagnosis. She thought little of it it was probably a coincidence. But then Eng noticed a few more children with autism in the families. And then a few more. Ã¢ÂÂWe started going, Ã¢ÂÂHuh, how come thereÃ¢ÂÂs all this autism in the family members? Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ she recalls. Curious to see if this trend was more than a fluke, Eng teamed up in 2004 with Merlin Butler, a clinical geneticist at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City. Eng and Butler screened 18 children with an autism diagnosis and macrocephaly, because enlarged head size is a hallmark of both Cowden syndrome and autism. They found that three of the 18 children have mutations in PTEN. Mutations in PTEN have been linked to dozens of cancers, but the gene had never before been shown to have any effect on social skills or behavior. Ã¢ÂÂWow,Ã¢ÂÂ Eng recalls thinking. Ã¢ÂÂPTEN plays a role in a neurodevelopmental disorder, too. Ã¢ÂÂ The finding was so unexpected that it was a tough sell. The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine both rejected the paper. Ã¢ÂÂThey didnÃ¢ÂÂt believe us,Ã¢ÂÂ says Eng, now head of the Cleveland ClinicÃ¢ÂÂs Genomic Medicine Institute. Ã¢ÂÂTheir reaction was: Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs a cancer gene. How can this be? Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ To Eng, it was perfectly plausible that a mutation in the gene could lead to autism as well as to the many cancers of Cowden syndrome. Cancer arises when PTEN mutations release their brake on cell growth and proliferation, and cells grow out of control. When PTEN mutations cause an overgrowth of nerve fibers in the brain, Eng reasoned, they might instead lead to autism. The Journal of Medical Genetics ultimately published the study in 2005. Other groups soon confirmed the findings, and today the subtype of autism with PTEN mutations and macrocephaly Ã¢ÂÂ  called   Ã¢ÂÂ  is estimated to represent up to 2 percent of all autism cases. The unexpected connection between cancer and autism isnÃ¢ÂÂt limited to PTEN. In the past decade, many cellular pathways involved in cancer have been found to overlap with those implicated in autism, and dozens of genes have been linked to both. Ã¢ÂÂWe didnÃ¢ÂÂt know, when we started out, how [the autism genes] would look,Ã¢ÂÂ says Michael Wigler, a molecular biologist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York who became involved in autism research after 25 years as a cancer scientist. Ã¢ÂÂIt turns out that they are all over the place,Ã¢ÂÂ says Wigler. Ã¢ÂÂThe body doesnÃ¢ÂÂt invent each cellular system from scratch. Ã¢ÂÂ The findings have sparked investigations into whether autism treatments can piggyback off of approved cancer drugs that target specific genes. They also raise concerns that Charlie and other children with autism who have mutations in known cancer genes might be at increased risk for developing malignancies. So far, scientists have no concrete answers to address this worry. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂve barely scratched the surface,Ã¢ÂÂ says Eng. * * * Most researchers agree that a combination of genetics and environmental factors lead to autism. Hundreds of genes are involved in autism, though only a fraction of these are strong candidates for the condition. Mutations are typically categorized as either Ã¢ÂÂgermline,Ã¢ÂÂ meaning that someone is born with the mutation and carries it in nearly every cell of the body, or Ã¢ÂÂsomatic,Ã¢ÂÂ meaning that the mutation occurs after birth and affects only a subset of the bodyÃ¢ÂÂs cells. Cancer is usually a disease of aging, caused by somatic mutations autism, a developmental condition, is usually linked to germline glitches. So it was a surprise when autism studies started picking out genes in pathways typically associated with cancer. In several instances, the crossover emerged in much the same way it did with Cowden syndrome Ã¢ÂÂ  with scientists noticing autism traits in people they were treating for other conditions. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what happened with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) a rare condition caused by in TSC1 or TSC2. Both genes are located downstream from PTEN on a pathway known as mTOR (for mammalian target of rapamycin mutations). In people with this condition, benign tumors grow in the brain and other organs, causing seizures, lung and kidney disease and other health problems, and occasionally turn malignant. Around 20 years ago, as autism diagnoses started to rise, clinicians began to recognize that autism was strikingly common among people with TSC. Today, up to half of people with TSC are estimated to have autism. Something similar also happened with RASopathies, a group of five disorders characterized by developmental issues, tumors and skin discoloration. Katherine Rauen, chief of genomic medicine at the University of California, Davis, identified mutations in the   pathway, a   cancer pathway, as the cause of RASopathies. Around 15 years ago, Rauen began to notice that many people with RASopathies are diagnosed with autism or have   features. Ã¢ÂÂWhen you see rare syndromes, and you see a lot of them, you start picking out patterns,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. In 2013, Rauen and her colleagues reported that 27 percent of people with RASopathies meet the criteria for autism. Other researchers hit upon the cancer connection directly, through deep dives into the genome. Geneticist Evan Eichler and his collaborators are sequencing the DNA of tens of thousands of children with autism as well as their unaffected family members to show that genetic mutations underlie autism. Among the first genes that popped up in their quest was CHD8, a gene that is involved in arranging DNA into tightly packed chromosomes. CHD8 also interacts with the WNT signaling pathway, which translates messages from outside cells into changes in gene expression, and has strong cancer ties. Eichler and his colleagues found that spontaneous, or de novo, mutations in CHD8 seem to cause a distinct subtype of autism with specific physical traits. When they looked at children with CHD8 mutations and autism, they noted that the children have broad foreheads, large heads,   eyes, and gastrointestinal issues. The growing number of cancer genes linked to autism piqued the curiosity of Janine LaSalle, an autism researcher at the University of California, Davis. In a study published in March, she and her colleagues reported that at least 43 genes thought to be involved in autism are also associated with cancer. Of those, 16 genes, including PTEN and CHD8, have strong autism links, and 8 others lead to   conditions such as Rett syndrome and TSC. Ã¢ÂÂSome themes jumped outÃ¢ÂÂ from the list, says LaSalle. She saw genes involved in chromatin  Ã¢ÂÂ  the   complex that forms chromosomes Ã¢ÂÂ  DNA repair and the transmission of signals that alter cell activity. Nine genes involved in the WNT pathway alone showed up all are involved in genome maintenance, or fighting damaging assaults on DNA Ã¢ÂÂ  and thatÃ¢ÂÂs a clue. The thinking is that early in brain development, errors in pathways that maintain the genomeÃ¢ÂÂs integrity may lead to autism. If the mistakes happen later in life, says LaSalle, they may occur in cell types prone to tumors. There may be more to it than timing and cell type. Eng and others are delving into the specific types of mutations, too, to see whether certain kinds of mutations contribute to autism, whereas others shift the balance toward cancer.   * * * When Eng first made the autism connection in 2005, she knew sheÃ¢ÂÂd hit upon a mystery she couldnÃ¢ÂÂt solve alone. She needed to find the right partner. As it turns out, someone else was looking for a similar meeting of minds. Clinical psychologist Thomas Frazier had just shifted his focus from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder to concentrate on autism, after his son was diagnosed with autism. Frazier and Eng, who had just moved to the Cleveland Clinic, clicked immediately. Ã¢ÂÂHad we met 20 years before, we wouldÃ¢ÂÂve shaken hands, and that wouldÃ¢ÂÂve been it,Ã¢ÂÂ says Frazier, who now runs the Cleveland ClinicÃ¢ÂÂs Center for Autism. Ã¢ÂÂThere would have been no reason for us to collaborate. Ã¢ÂÂ Eng invited Frazier to attend her weekly lab meetings. After publishing on   in 2005, EngÃ¢ÂÂs autism research had stalled, and she was eager to get it moving again. For his part, Frazier needed a mentor to guide him through genetics. When he showed up for EngÃ¢ÂÂs lab meetings, he initially had to look up words on his phone. EngÃ¢ÂÂs team would talk about the chemical modifications of DNA that alter gene expression, for example. Ã¢ÂÂI had no idea what methylation was. The first year was really brutal like that,Ã¢ÂÂ he says, laughing. FrazierÃ¢ÂÂs hard work paid off, and Eng was impressed with how deeply he came to understand genetics. Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs really rare,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. The two now partner to explore what PTEN mutations do in people with autism, and hope to use their knowledge to find targeted treatments. In 2009, for instance, they began hunting for biological markers of autism, comparing people with   and those who have autism but no PTEN mutation. To understand how mutations in PTEN cause autism features, they compared 17 children who have   with three other groups: 16 children with autism and large heads, 38 with autism alone, and 14 controls. Compared with the other groups, children with   had lower PTEN protein levels. Magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed that they had enlarged volumes of white matter, the fibers that brain cells use to communicate. The children also had poorer working memory and slower processing skills than the children in the other groups. Taken together, says Frazier, the findings indicate that low PTEN protein levels drive white matter abnormalities, which in turn impair cognition. The next step, says Frazier, will be to pin down the exact molecular effects of the loss of PTEN protein Ã¢ÂÂ  an endeavor that other groups are working on as well. PTEN typically cycles between the cytoplasm (the fluid inside the cells) and the nucleus (the control center where the DNA is stored). The protein plays different roles in each location: In the nucleus, PTEN stabilizes DNA strands and plays some role in the cell cycle, whereas in the cytoplasm it plays multiple roles, including controlling cell proliferation and helping to suppress tumor activity. EngÃ¢ÂÂs lab created mice in which the PTEN protein clusters in the cytoplasm rather than in the nucleus, hoping to understand how the location of the protein influences brain physiology and behavior. Mice with most of the protein in the cytoplasm perform better in maze trials but display abnormal social behavior, traits that line up with those seen in people who have mild features of autism. Eng and Frazier havenÃ¢ÂÂt thoroughly studied mice with PTEN primarily in the nucleus, but the mice appear to perform poorly on memory tasks and be socially withdrawn. EngÃ¢ÂÂs lab and others are also working to tease apart how PTEN mutations in autism and cancer differ. So far, theyÃ¢ÂÂve found that PTEN mutations associated with autism tend to be missense mutations, in which one amino acid is replaced by another. That change drastically lowers, but does not halt, its key activity. A variety of mutations seen in cancers, by contrast, entirely disrupt PTEN, effectively halting its activity and releasing a brake that prevents tumors. EngÃ¢ÂÂs group is developing stem cell models that could pinpoint more specific differences. In cases of autism caused by mutations in other genes, it appears that the same mutation sometimes occurs in people with autism and those with cancer the difference is in when and where in the body the mutation occurs. For example, the same germline mutation in a person with   autism might also be found in someone with bladder cancer Ã¢ÂÂ  but only in the cells lining the bladder, and accompanied by mutations in other genes. Likewise, mutations of the TSC genes seem to have different effects in neurons than they do in other cells of the body, says Mustafa Sahin, director of the Translational Neuroscience Center at Boston ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital. In cancer cells, the genes control cell growth and proliferation through the mTOR pathway, but in neurons, they appear to regulate connections between the cells. In mice missing one of the TSC genes, the axons Ã¢ÂÂ  the long, thin part of nerve cells that conduct electrical impulses Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂgo to the wrong places in the brain,Ã¢ÂÂ Sahin says. Diffusion tensor imaging, which maps nerve fibers, also reveals abnormalities in the wiring of the corpus callosum Ã¢ÂÂ  the bridge between the two hemispheres of the brain Ã¢ÂÂ  and in language pathways in people with TSC. For now, however, the precise series of events that push development off track remain a mystery. Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs really what weÃ¢ÂÂre focusing on right now,Ã¢ÂÂ Sahin says. * * * There are no drugs approved to treat autismÃ¢ÂÂs core features, but the cancer link offers at least one clear possibility for leapfrogging forward. Billions of dollars devoted to cancer research have produced treatments that zero in on specific mutations Ã¢ÂÂ  shutting down defective enzymes, for instance, or checking overactive proteins. Autism researchers are looking to borrow from cancerÃ¢ÂÂs medicine cabinet. Targeted therapies devised for cancer could become Ã¢ÂÂincredibly effectiveÃ¢ÂÂ for the subtypes of autism that arise from a single mutation, says Luis Parada, director of the Brain Tumor Center at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Parada has made mouse models for both cancer and autism, with the mice lacking genes including PTEN, TSC1, TSC2 and NFI, a gene linked to autism and pediatric cancers. In support of this hope, Sahin and others found in 2012 that mice missing TSC1 or TSC2 display   behaviors, including atypical social interactions and repetitive behaviors. Rapamycin, a compound that blocks the mTOR pathway, halts these behavioral problems and seizures. Buoyed by these results, researchers then moved into clinical trials. In 2016, Sahin completed a   trial of 47 people with TSC, aged 6 to 21 years.   of the participants received a placebo, while the rest were given everolimus, a safer analog of rapamycin that is frequently used to treat pancreatic cancer. Neither the participants nor the clinicians knew who was receiving the drug. The researchers are still analyzing the results, but so far they do not see marked improvement in cognitive function in the everolimus group compared with the placebo group. The team hasnÃ¢ÂÂt yet looked at autism features such as impaired social behavior and communication. Even so, Sahin is already thinking about next steps. In mice, he says, Ã¢ÂÂwe can rescue   behaviors if we start the treatment early, in the first days or weeks after birth, but often not if we start much later. Ã¢ÂÂ So a   treatment may not be enough to improve autism features in the age range tested. Ã¢ÂÂWe may have to redesign the trial to potentially look at the effects of everolimus in younger children,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Eng and Frazier plan to launch their first trial of everolimus in people with   early in 2017. Rapamycin and related compounds have been shown to prevent the overgrowth of brain cells that leads to macrocephaly and   behaviors in mice lacking PTEN. Their trial will last two to three years, with participants taking the drug for six months. Ã¢ÂÂWe want to give the medicine time to actually show an effect,Ã¢ÂÂ says Frazier. The aim is to enroll 40 participants, also between 6 and 21 years of age. Judging from the people Frazier and Eng have seen at their clinic in Cleveland, however, they anticipate that the participants will skew young. Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs when the brain is most malleable,Ã¢ÂÂ says Frazier. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂll certainly look at age as a possible moderator of treatment outcome. Ã¢ÂÂ He emphasizes that although he is hopeful the drug will prove safe, and that the participants show at least a small improvement in brain function, he canÃ¢ÂÂt predict the outcome of the trial. Ã¢ÂÂIn a wild, wild scenario, maybe their autism symptoms get better,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. * * * Autumn Ryan hopes Charlie will participate in the trial, but she knows thatÃ¢ÂÂs not a given. Eng, ever the straight shooter, has told her that Charlie, who is now 7, may be too intellectually disabled to participate. Ryan is reassured to know that even if Charlie doesnÃ¢ÂÂt take part in the trial, Eng and Frazier will continue to care for him, answering questions by phone or email, and seeing him once a year when the family visits the Cleveland Clinic. ItÃ¢ÂÂs an arduous trip that requires two plane rides and wears out both Charlie and his mom. Yet Ryan wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt skip it. Ã¢ÂÂI wonÃ¢ÂÂt travel all day to go on vacation with Charlie,Ã¢ÂÂ she says, Ã¢ÂÂbut I will to go to the Cleveland Clinic. Ã¢ÂÂ As Charlie gets older, these visits will involve more invasive tests to screen for cancer, such as colonoscopies beginning when heÃ¢ÂÂs 9. Ryan worries about breast cancer, too: People with PTEN mutations have an 85 percent lifetime risk of developing that malignancy, and a drug Charlie is on to treat aggressiveness and hyperactivity, risperidone, is causing him to develop breasts. Ã¢ÂÂAll we can do is watch and wait,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. RyanÃ¢ÂÂs concerns are shared by other parents whose children are on the spectrum and have mutated cancer genes. They canÃ¢ÂÂt help but worry: Are their children also at heightened risk for malignancies? In short, nobody knows for certain. A handful of studies indicate that the genetic overlap might not increase these individualsÃ¢ÂÂ odds of developing cancer. In one analysis of the medical records of thousands of people with autism in California, cancer didnÃ¢ÂÂt make the list of the conditions these individuals are most likely to develop. In fact, some evidence suggests that they might have an unusually low cancer risk. In another   analysis, University of Iowa researchers compared the medical records of 1, 837 people who have an autism diagnosis with those of 9, 336 controls. They found that people with autism have a lifetime cancer risk of 1. 3 percent versus 3. 9 percent in the control group. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs not enough evidence to say that mutations in cancer genes that contribute to autism prevent malignancies, Eng cautions. No study has specifically analyzed cancer risk in people with autism who have mutations linked to cancer pathways. Eng and Frazier are collaborating with researchers at four other institutions to follow up to 100 children with   long term. They might not have to wait decades to get a signal for risk, because thyroid cancer, which can be detected with a simple ultrasound, can develop in children as young as 4. (To date, none of the 30 children with   seen at the Cleveland Clinic has developed thyroid cancer.) If people with   do develop cancer, there are several effective drugs that might be able to combat it Ã¢ÂÂ  some of which, like rapamycin, are the very same therapies being tested for autism. Even if Eng is successful in finding targeted treatments for people with   however, she would be helping only a small fraction of people with autism. Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs how precision therapy works,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. But given her years of experience in cancer biology, Eng inevitably thinks of the parallels: Just as cancer drugs developed for one type of cancer have turned out to be effective at fighting other types, perhaps a treatment for one subtype of autism will follow a similar arc. The everolimus trial is a first step to testing this optimistic scenario. EngÃ¢ÂÂs team is looking for gene variants, or even novel pathways, that havenÃ¢ÂÂt yet been identified as being important to autism. Should they hit upon anything promising, they plan to scour the enormous inventory of existing cancer drugs. Ã¢ÂÂSome drug companies may have these therapies already,Ã¢ÂÂ Eng says. Ã¢ÂÂMaybe thereÃ¢ÂÂs a drug theyÃ¢ÂÂve shelved because it didnÃ¢ÂÂt work as theyÃ¢ÂÂd hoped, and voilÃÂ , it targets the underlying mechanism we donÃ¢ÂÂt even yet know exists. Ã¢ÂÂ Ryan, meanwhile, says she knows Eng and Frazier are in for the long haul Ã¢ÂÂ  and so is she. Ã¢ÂÂCharlie will be a part of any study that he qualifies for,Ã¢ÂÂ Ryan says. Ã¢ÂÂWe want to get as much information about this condition as possible, and to help other families as much as we can. Ã¢ÂÂ This article appears courtesy of Spectrum.

2092,"In recent years, scientists have been dealing with concerns about a reproducibility crisis Ã¢ÂÂ  the possibility that many published findings may not actually be true. Psychologists have grappled intensively with this problem, trying to assess its scope and look for solutions. And two reports from pharmaceutical companies have suggested that cancer biologists have to face a similar reckoning.   In 2011, Bayer Healthcare said that its   scientists could only validate 25 percent of basic studies in cancer and other conditions. (Drug companies routinely do such checks so they can use the information in those studies as a starting point for developing new drugs.) A year later, Glenn Begley and Lee Ellis from Amgen said that the firm could only confirm the findings in 6 out of 53 landmark cancer papers Ã¢ÂÂ  just 11 percent. Perhaps, they wrote, that might explain why Ã¢ÂÂour ability to translate cancer research to clinical success has been remarkably low. Ã¢ÂÂ But citing reasons of confidentiality, neither the Bayer nor Amgen teams released the list of papers that they checked, or their methods or results. Ironically, without that information, there was no way of checking if their claims about irreproducibility were themselves reproducible. Ã¢ÂÂThe reports were shocking, but also seemed like Ã¢ÂÂ says Tim Errington, a cell biologist at the Center for Open Science (COS). Elizabeth Iorns had the same thought, and she saw a way to do a better and more transparent job. She had founded a   called Science Exchange, which uses a large network of contract labs to provide research support to scientists Ã¢ÂÂ  and in some cases, check their work. She contacted the COS, and together, they launched the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology Ã¢ÂÂ  an initiative that used the Science Exchange labs to replicate key results from the 50 most cited papers in cancer biology, published between 2010 and 2012. (The COS recently used the same model for psychology studies to good effect.)   The results from the first five of these replication attempts were published today Ã¢ÂÂ  and they offer no clean answers. Two of them largely (but not entirely) confirmed the conclusions of the original studies. One failed to do so. And two were inconclusive for technical reasons Ã¢ÂÂ  the mouse strains or cancer cell lines that were used in the original studies didnÃ¢ÂÂt behave in the same way the second time round. These uncertainties mean that itÃ¢ÂÂs very hard to say whether each replication attempt Ã¢ÂÂworked,Ã¢ÂÂ or whether each original study was actually reproducible. Ã¢ÂÂEveryone wants us to paint the project in black and white,Ã¢ÂÂ says Errington. Ã¢ÂÂWhat percent of these papers replicate? IÃ¢ÂÂve been asked that so many times, but itÃ¢ÂÂs not an easy question. Ã¢ÂÂ To him, the projectÃ¢ÂÂs goal isnÃ¢ÂÂt to get a hard percentage, but to understand why two seemingly identical goes at the same experiment might produce different results, and to ultimately make it easier for one group of scientists to check anotherÃ¢ÂÂs work. The Reproducibility Project team   all of their work. That is, for each targeted paper, they wrote up their experimental plans in full, ran them past the original authors, and submitted them to the journal eLife for peer review. Only then did they start the experiments. Once the results were in, they were reviewed a second time, before being published. The hardest part, by far, was figuring out exactly what the original labs actually did. Scientific papers come with methods sections that theoretically ought to provide recipes for doing the same experiments. But often, those recipes are incomplete, missing out important steps, details, or ingredients. In some cases, the recipes arenÃ¢ÂÂt described at all researchers simply cite an earlier study that used a similar technique. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve done it myself: you reference a previous paper and that one references a paper and that one references a paper, and now youÃ¢ÂÂve gone years and the methodology doesnÃ¢ÂÂt exist,Ã¢ÂÂ admit Errington. Ã¢ÂÂMost people looking at these papers wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt even think of going through these steps. TheyÃ¢ÂÂd just guess. If you asked 20 different labs to replicate a paper, youÃ¢ÂÂd end up with 10 different methodologies that arenÃ¢ÂÂt really comparable. Ã¢ÂÂ So, in every case, he had to ask the scientists behind the original experiments for the details of their work. Oftentimes, the person who actually did the experiments had left the lab, so an existing team member had to rummage through old notebooks or data files. The project ended up being hugely   for everyone concerned. Ã¢ÂÂWe spent a boatload of time trying to get back to ground zero,Ã¢ÂÂ says Errington. And for what? The results of the first five papers show just how hard it is to interpret a replication attempt in this field. For example, in 2012, Levi Garraway at the   Cancer Institute found that melanoma skin cancers frequently carry mutations in a gene called PREX2. His team then showed that these mutations accelerate the growth of human melanoma cells that were transplanted onto mice. But replicating team couldnÃ¢ÂÂt confirm the latter result in their experiment, the PREX2 mutations made no difference. Does that mean that GarrawayÃ¢ÂÂs study was wrong? Not quite. Even though the replication team got their melanoma cells and mice from the same source as GarrawayÃ¢ÂÂs group, in their hands, the transplanted tumours grew much faster than had been reported. The PREX2 mutations made no difference because all the cells were already zooming along in sixth gear. Small differences in the ways the cells were grown or the mice were housed could have contributed to the differences between these studies, writes Roger Davis, a cell biologist at the University of Masschussetts Medical School, reviewed the PREX2 replication paper. In another case, Irving Weissman from Stanford Medicine showed that cancer cells carry high levels of a protein called CD47, and antibodies that target this protein can slow the growth of human tumor cells that had been transplanted into mice. In this case, the replication experiment was inconclusive because all the transplanted tumors would spontaneously regress, antibodies or no. Some might argue that these differences arise because the project relied on contractors, who lack the experience and artisanal skills of the scientists in the original teams. Iorns disagrees. Ã¢ÂÂThe teams were all selected for their technical expertise in the experiments being conducted,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. Ã¢ÂÂThey routinely run these types of experiments all the time. Ã¢ÂÂ Instead, she and Errington argue that the differences stem from the inherent and underappreciated variability of the cells and animals being used in these studies. In psychology, researchers who replicate a study have no choice but to recruit different volunteers, who might differ from the original sample in critical ways. But in theory, cancer biologists should be able to use the exact same lineage of cells or breed of rodents Ã¢ÂÂ  genetically identical and sourced from the same suppliers Ã¢ÂÂ  which should behave in the same way. Ã¢ÂÂBut some of these models kind of fell apart, and you canÃ¢ÂÂt dismiss that,Ã¢ÂÂ says Errington. He hopes that these results will spur other scientists to better explore those variations, and include more quality control steps in their work. And perhaps the most important result from the project so far, as Daniel Engber wrote in Slate, is that it has been Ã¢ÂÂa hopeless slog. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂIf people had deposited raw data and full protocols at the time of publication, we wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt have to go back to the original authors,Ã¢ÂÂ says Iorns. That would make it much easier for scientists to truly check each otherÃ¢ÂÂs work. The National Institutes of Health seem to agree. In recently released guidelines, meant to improve the reproducibility of research, they recommend that journals ask for more thorough methods sections and more sharing of data. And in this, the Reproducibility Project have modelled the change they want to see, documenting every step of their project on a wiki. Ã¢ÂÂWe want to applaud replication efforts like this,Ã¢ÂÂ says Atul Butte from the University of California, San Francisco, whose study was among the two that were successfully reproduced. Ã¢ÂÂIt is important for the public to have trust in scientists, and belief in the veracity of our published findings. Ã¢ÂÂ But he suggests that the team chooses their targeted studies in a Ã¢ÂÂmore impactful mannerÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ  not by citations, but by those that are most likely to lead to new treatments. In the meantime, the team still needs to finish its first wave of replications. They initially set out to replicate 50 old papers, but the unexpectedly high costs of doing so have forced them to scale back. Ã¢ÂÂIn the end, we think weÃ¢ÂÂll complete 30,Ã¢ÂÂ says Iorns.",cancer,How Reliable Are Cancer Studies? ,2092.0,2092.0,92.0,
2093,"LaFleur was first diagnosed with breast cancer in July 2011. Six rounds of chemotherapy, a lumpectomy, a second surgery, and six weeks of radiation drove the cancer into remission Ã¢ÂÂ  only for it to return in September 2014. This time, she underwent the mastectomy and reconstruction, and after one final surgery, she was  . But the invasive treatments left her feeling that her body no longer quite belonged to her. Ã¢ÂÂI realized recovering from this trauma was going to be a complicated process,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. On the floor, LaFleurÃ¢ÂÂs mind drifted to, of all things, belly dance. Before her diagnosis, she had danced with Fata Morgana, a   troupe in Charlottesville, where sheÃ¢ÂÂs working toward a Ph. D. in ancient Greek and Latin historiography at the University of Virginia. The slew of medical treatments had driven LaFleur into a sedentary life, disconnected from the activities she once enjoyed. She wondered, could returning to belly dance help her find a way back to the life she had known before cancer? LaFleur knew that belly dance couldnÃ¢ÂÂt treat, let alone cure, cancer. But the practice incorporates a mix of gentle movements and intense focus that she realized was the perfect balance of physical activity, play, and meditation for her recovery. In fact, maybe it could be the perfect activity for other people recovering from cancer, too. Soon, she was thinking through how she could design a   class. Beyond Charlottesville, LaFleurÃ¢ÂÂs inclination to connect healing with play aligns with a growing sector of therapists in the United States. The field, known as recreational therapy, uses games and other leisurely pursuits, including activities as mundane as   tosses and art projects, to help patients regain fine motor skills and reduce anxiety or depression. Like its   relatives Ã¢ÂÂ  such as physical or occupational therapy Ã¢ÂÂ  recreational therapy relies on measurable outcomes, but aims for fun and socialization outside of the medical office. The field isnÃ¢ÂÂt widely known Ã¢ÂÂ  and itÃ¢ÂÂs controversial. Because most states donÃ¢ÂÂt license recreational therapists, itÃ¢ÂÂs difficult to determine whether a practitioner is offering legitimate therapy or promising unrealistic results. Music therapy, a subset of recreational therapy, has also come under scrutiny in recent years as some people insist that it helps children with developmental disorders and others worry the impact is irresponsibly exaggerated. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment opportunities for recreational therapists are predicted to grow by 12 percent between 2014 and 2024, a rate faster than average across all occupations, due in part to AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs aging of population as baby boomers retire. Currently licensed in Utah, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and New Hampshire, with bills pending in several other states, recreational therapists must earn a   college degree, complete a   internship, and pass a   exam. Since its formation in 1984, the American Therapeutic Recreation Association Ã¢ÂÂ  the largest national membership organization for recreational therapists Ã¢ÂÂ  has grown from 60 to more than 2, 200 practitioners. Vincent Bonadies has practiced recreational therapy for nearly 38 years and currently serves on ATRAÃ¢ÂÂs board. In reflecting on his career, he recalled one of his first patients, a young man who had been in a motorcycle wreck that left him almost completely paralyzed. The man spent hours every day sitting in bed with little to break up the monotony. Ã¢ÂÂHe had the ability to move his head, and he loved painting,Ã¢ÂÂ Bonadies says. So Bonadies helped the patient learn to hold a paintbrush in his mouth. Like many other patients whose cancer has come back after remission, LaFleur remains afflicted by the nagging doubt that the cancer is ever truly gone. Ã¢ÂÂCancer is, at its core, your body turning against itself,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. Ã¢ÂÂYou have a hard time trusting your immune system. ItÃ¢ÂÂs very alienating, and it can be frustrating to not have the stamina youÃ¢ÂÂve had your whole life. Ã¢ÂÂ LaFleur liked that belly dance can promote body positivity and isnÃ¢ÂÂt too difficult to pick up. The dance can also be modified to accommodate students who might need to sit or lie down due to weakened health. She decided to limit her class to other cancer survivors with the goal of connecting over the shared experience. She named the project My Body Raqs, in reference to a classic Egyptian style of belly dance, and began offering free classes. While the notion that exercise and community involvement has a positive impact on health isnÃ¢ÂÂt controversial, some do question the legitimacy of recreational therapy. With few states licensing recreational therapists, regulation is nonexistent and purported recreational therapists may not be qualified to practice. The petition website Change. org is littered with appeals for licensing from people in states that donÃ¢ÂÂt currently recognize recreational therapists. Unlike LaFleurÃ¢ÂÂs free, casual classes, an unlicensed recreational therapist could potentially charge steep    fees while promising impossible results. Bonadies, the recreational therapist, believes that the lack of public familiarity with his profession is the key issue holding licensing back. Ã¢ÂÂ[Recreational therapy] is not a household name like physical therapy,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Recently, there are some signs that this will change. In 2016, the VeteransÃ¢ÂÂ Health Administration endorsed recreational therapy as a valuable treatment option for veterans, noting that the practice has been in use since the Civil War. Christiana Brenin, a University of Virginia oncologist who specializes in breast and colorectal cancer, would not readily recommend recreational therapy to her patients. Ã¢ÂÂThe short answer is no,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. During treatments, she works closely with a team of clinical psychologists who help her patients address the anxiety and fear that can accompany a diagnosis. Additional layers of therapy could be unnecessary, if not harmful, for patients already dealing with   and exhausting treatments, she says. And in cases of breast cancer like LaFleurÃ¢ÂÂs, she points out, most patients continue to work and do recreational things throughout their treatment anyway. Why introduce unnecessary approaches? Still, Brenin wonÃ¢ÂÂt stop patients from pursuing recreational therapy if they think it will help. Ã¢ÂÂI definitely believe in placebo effect,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. She has noticed that patients who embrace placebo treatments regain a sense of control over their care and tend to be less stressed. Moreover, she encourages any activity that can help patients shore up their support networks. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve had some patients decide to volunteer in support groups to help others who are having a hard time,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. Ã¢ÂÂThey find a meaning in life. ItÃ¢ÂÂs really good way to reintegrate into society. Ã¢ÂÂ This was true of LaFleur. She planned her first   class with no idea whether she would spend the session teaching or waiting in an empty room. To her relief, a small group of women arrived, curious to see what she would offer. Over the course of eight weeks, nearly all of the students returned. Away from doctors and caretakers, the group found relief in speaking frankly about their shared cancer experiences. Ã¢ÂÂWe make all these morbid jokes,Ã¢ÂÂ LaFleur says. When the class ended, she shared everyoneÃ¢ÂÂs contact information and has occasionally organized  . Cancer still affects LaFleurÃ¢ÂÂs daily life. The illness has left her with chronic fatigue syndrome, a constellation of symptoms that makes her search for words that used to come easily and forces her to take naps during the day. SheÃ¢ÂÂs had to put her belly dance classes on pause while completing a teaching assignment for her Ph. D. in Lynchburg, Virginia, but hopes to return with a new round of My Body Raqs class offerings this summer. No one has determined a perfect formula for helping cancer patients heal. As Brenin points out, each cancer patient is unique, and treatment that works with some patients may not work for others. Regardless, LaFleur is convinced that a little belly dance doesnÃ¢ÂÂt hurt.",cancer,Belly Dancing to Recover From Cancer Treatment,2093.0,2093.0,93.0,
2094,"When I meet Brealey in April 2016, in a brightly colored room at University College Hospital, sheÃ¢ÂÂs about to start her third drug Ã¢ÂÂ  a new one called nivolumab that her doctor, a young oncologist named Charlie Swanton, is hopeful about. As he preps her for the new treatment, he is also thinking about how to manage the severe pain that the tumor is causing, as it presses against the nerves that run along BrealeyÃ¢ÂÂs ribs. Ã¢ÂÂIt hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been easy for Laura,Ã¢ÂÂ says Swanton. Ã¢ÂÂWhen I first told her she couldnÃ¢ÂÂt go back to Singapore to visit her family. .. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ. .. I nearly fell off my chair in shock,Ã¢ÂÂ she finishes. Brealey, now 75, has bright blue eyes, short white hair, and preternaturally high spirits. Ã¢ÂÂMy best friendÃ¢ÂÂs brother calls me the Indestructible Laura. IÃ¢ÂÂm very active. Before this, I was going to the gym, doing   pilates, gardening. Now, I just sleep. This has been a nuisance. Ã¢ÂÂ She misses the theater, longs to return to Asia, dreams about going on the   Railway. When she mentions the tumor that is curtailing all of those plans, she talks as if it was an errant child. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs so stubborn,Ã¢ÂÂ she says.   BrealeyÃ¢ÂÂs story is typical. An initial wave of treatments seemed to knock a tumor out, but despite the scalpels, the radiation, and the drugs Ã¢ÂÂ  not to mention relentless optimism Ã¢ÂÂ  the tumor recurs, seemingly more resilient than before. Stubborn, as she says. Even the latest drugs, tailored to strike at the specific genetic faults behind a personÃ¢ÂÂs tumor, fail to permanently halt the backswing of a tumorÃ¢ÂÂs pendulum. The problem, according to Swanton and a growing group of other   scientists, is that weÃ¢ÂÂve been neglecting one of the most fundamental aspects of cancer Ã¢ÂÂ  that it is a disease of evolution. That might sound strange. WeÃ¢ÂÂre used to the idea that animals, plants, or microbes can evolve, but cancer isnÃ¢ÂÂt a   organism. ItÃ¢ÂÂs part of us. And yet, it also evolves, adapting to new challenges as surely as Galapagos finches. In the classical view of cancer, a cell picks up mutations until it shakes off the checks and balances that restrain its growth, allowing it to divide uncontrollably and turn into a tumor. This linear process is a macabre version of that famous image where a chimp walks to the right and gradually morphs into a human hunter. And both visuals are wrong. In reality, tumors quickly become seething masses of varied cells, all with their own mutations. One area might start growing faster its neighbor might come to evade the immune system. Over time, the fittest lineages produce more descendants and rise to dominance Ã¢ÂÂ  the essence of Darwinian natural selection. So forget the linear march. The better visual is that of a tree, with an initial trunk radiating into a web of branches. In 1837, Charles Darwin drew one such tree in one of his notebooks to represent how species evolve from a common ancestor. He could just as easily have been sketching the birth of a tumor. This realization goes some way to explaining why the war against cancer has been so entrenched and unexpectedly difficult. Clinicians often diagnose these diseases by taking a biopsy from a tumor, but a single sample could miss important mutations with very different prognostic implications just centimeters away. And when we hit tumors with drugs or radiation, we create a potent source of artificial selection, effectively breeding for hardier tumors. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why relapses occur. Ã¢ÂÂWe deal with patients, day in and day out, whose disease initially benefits from chemo,Ã¢ÂÂ says Swanton. Ã¢ÂÂBut over time, they develop resistance against multiple drugs. The only way you can really fathom how a tumor can be one step ahead of the clinician at all times is through Darwinian selection. Ã¢ÂÂ The legendary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky said that Ã¢ÂÂNothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution. Ã¢ÂÂ Cancer researchers are now learning that lesson. By understanding how cancer evolves, they hope to start thinking several moves ahead of the disease Ã¢ÂÂ  halting, redirecting, or even preventing its evolution. To start, in 2013, Swanton launched an ambitious study called TRACERx, which stands for Tracking Cancer Evolution through Treatment (Rx). ItÃ¢ÂÂs a    initiative to nail down the evolution of lung cancer. SwantonÃ¢ÂÂs team of over 200 collaborators followed 850 patients through their treatments, taking several samples from across their tumors at several points in time Ã¢ÂÂ  from diagnosis to treatment to either cure or relapse. They then used this information to understand how the cancers change over time, how that affects a patientÃ¢ÂÂs fate, how to detect that evolution, and how to beat it. Brealey, whose name has been changed for this story, was the 39th patient to sign up for TRACERx Ã¢ÂÂ  and when I meet her, she is dressed for the part. She holds up the pale stone necklace around her neck, which depicts a   tree. Ã¢ÂÂLook, IÃ¢ÂÂm wearing the tree of life,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. Ã¢ÂÂHow appropriate!Ã¢ÂÂ says Swanton, delighted. Ã¢ÂÂMaybe itÃ¢ÂÂs a good omen,Ã¢ÂÂ she adds. * * * His suggestions went largely unheeded because he made them at the wrong time. In the 1970s, molecular biology was the hot new thing, and scientists were swept up by new techniques for studying cells in incredible detail. Many biology departments split into separate factions, walling off those who studied tiny cells and molecules from those who studied entire organisms. Cancer researchers clustered with the former, and evolutionary biologists with the latter. Mel Greaves was an exception. Now the director of the Center for Evolution at The Institute of Cancer Research, Greaves studied at University College London in the 1960s, in a department that focused heavily on the principles of evolution. His mentors drummed into his head that cells within a body are also subject to natural selection, just like individuals within a species. So when he read NovellÃ¢ÂÂs paper, it blew his mind. Ã¢ÂÂI thought: This is fundamental. This is how cancer works. It just smelled right. It made me think about everything I was doing in that light,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Greaves carried that realization with him throughout his work on childhood leukemia. But he could only act upon it at the turn of the century Ã¢ÂÂ  when new technology allowed him to efficiently sequence the genomes of individual cancer cells. In 2010, Greaves and his team used to tools to study 30 leukemia patients. In each one, they identified the mutations within 200 cancerous cells, and compared them to see how the cells were related. Ã¢ÂÂImmediately, we saw trees,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Ã¢ÂÂYou could find the simplest cell and work out its descendants and their descendants. Within two years, everyone was doing this. Ã¢ÂÂ For example, in 2012, Swanton and his colleagues found a similar metaphorical tree in a   tumor that they had cut out of a   patient. Even by eye, the variation was obvious. Ã¢ÂÂIt was a large lump, of course, but you could see individual nodules that had different colors,Ã¢ÂÂ recalls team member Marco Gerlinger. Ã¢ÂÂSome bled more. Some had this yellowish translucent appearance because they were storing fats. Others were brown and very dense because they lacked blood vessels. Ã¢ÂÂ In analyzing the tumor, Gerlinger and Swanton showed that this cancer was a world unto itself. Cells at one end had a different set of mutations from those at the other, or from secondary tumors that had spread around the patientÃ¢ÂÂs body. Of the 128 mutations that Swanton had detected, only a third of these were found throughout the patientÃ¢ÂÂs tumors. A quarter were unique to just one part. The same was true for three more kidney cancers that the team studied. Others found the same pattern in cancers of the esophagus, bowel, brain, breast, and more. Ã¢ÂÂEvery patient has several essentially independent cancers at one time,Ã¢ÂÂ says Greaves. Ã¢ÂÂThree to 20 in leukemia. Goodness knows how many in lung cancer. Ã¢ÂÂ Propelled by these discoveries, cancer research started evolving, too. The biggest cancer conferences were devoting keynote talks and entire sessions to the evolutionary side of cancer. When I went to one such session in 2014, a researcher joked to a huge, packed auditorium that Ã¢ÂÂwe used to be in the small room. Ã¢ÂÂ But this flurry of activity was tempered. Ã¢ÂÂThe reaction from oncologists was: Oh my God, this is bloody awful,Ã¢ÂÂ says Greaves. Ã¢ÂÂLook at all this complexity! ItÃ¢ÂÂs so pessimistic. And all I, Charlie, and others could say was: This is just what cancer is. We havenÃ¢ÂÂt understood the nature of the beast until now. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt feel daunted,Ã¢ÂÂ he adds, smiling. Ã¢ÂÂNow we know why the therapies are failing, why weÃ¢ÂÂre having such difficulty in eradicating the disease. ItÃ¢ÂÂs just like drug resistance in bacteria Ã¢ÂÂ  a rapidly evolving disease that weÃ¢ÂÂre racing to defeat. ItÃ¢ÂÂs an evolutionary arms race. Ã¢ÂÂ That insight, he says, is half the battle. The next half is working out what to do about it. * * * The diversity that Greaves, Swanton, and others have found explains why. A drug might successfully take out the vast majority of a tumorÃ¢ÂÂs cells, but even if a few survivors contain mutations that allow them to resist these assaults, they will repopulate. The cancer evolves its way around the drug, and the tumor recurs. Worse, tumors are diverse, so targeted therapies only might hit one part of the entire mass, leaving behind a reservoir of genetically different cells to grow anew. Targeted therapies are powerful, but cancer is a target with many bullseyes that shift position whenever struck. Ã¢ÂÂThis realization prompted me to change the way I think,Ã¢ÂÂ says Alberto Bardelli, an oncologist at the University of Torino, who studies targeted therapies. Rather than going after specific cancer genes, Ã¢ÂÂwe need to target the evolution of tumors Ã¢ÂÂ  how they change over time. Then weÃ¢ÂÂll make progress much more quickly. Ã¢ÂÂ For a start, reconstructing the evolution of cancer can help researchers to pick the right targets. Some mutations occur early in a tumorÃ¢ÂÂs life and are found in all of its cells Ã¢ÂÂ  theyÃ¢ÂÂre called trunk mutations. Others occur later are found in small regions Ã¢ÂÂ  branch mutations. Ã¢ÂÂIf youÃ¢ÂÂre going to target mutations, for goodness sake go for the trunk ones,Ã¢ÂÂ says Greaves. Ã¢ÂÂOtherwise itÃ¢ÂÂs like pruning a bush Ã¢ÂÂ  youÃ¢ÂÂll just stimulate growth. Ã¢ÂÂ ItÃ¢ÂÂs no coincidence that Gleevec, one of the most successful target therapies around, works by targeting a trunk mutation in leukemia Ã¢ÂÂ  one that almost always occurs at the very start of the disease. Ã¢ÂÂIt hits every cell, which is why it works pretty well,Ã¢ÂÂ says Greaves. Other scientists have started to identify common trunk mutations in other cancers. Attacking these is certainly a better strategy than ineffectually hacking at the branches, but it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt change the fact that tumors could adapt and regrow. A better tactic might be to use combinations of targeted drugs Ã¢ÂÂ  one to target mutations that already exist, and others to attack those that are likely to occur. Many cancers involve mutations in a gene called EGFR, and a drug called cetuximab was designed to block this gene. But tumors that initially shrink in the face of cetuximab invariably bounce back Ã¢ÂÂ  many because of mutations in a second gene called MEK. By using cetuximab and a   drug, Bardelli managed to successfully treat bowel cancers in mice, without any relapse. He had cut the tumors off from their usual evolutionary escape routes, intercepting resistance rather than simply reacting to it. As Robert Gatenby from the Lee Moffit Cancer Center and his colleagues once put it, Ã¢ÂÂIt is chess, not   . Ã¢ÂÂ But Banerji thinks this approach is unlikely to work in practice because the side effect of chemotherapies become too toxic when drugs are given in combination. You might kill a tumor Ã¢ÂÂ  but youÃ¢ÂÂll take the patient along with it. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂve looked at multiple ways of doing it and exhausted all the combinations,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs not going to be  . Ã¢ÂÂ Their opponent is nothing less than evolution itself Ã¢ÂÂ  the most dangerous foe of all, with a counter for every move. As the British chemist Leslie Orgel once said, Ã¢ÂÂEvolution is cleverer than you are. Ã¢ÂÂ So rather than opposing the inevitable evolution of cancer, it might be better to redirect it. Ã¢ÂÂEverything comes at a cost in evolution,Ã¢ÂÂ says BanerjiÃ¢ÂÂs colleague Andrea Sottoriva. Ã¢ÂÂBy standing up on two feet, we free up our hands but we canÃ¢ÂÂt outrun a lion. Ã¢ÂÂ In the same way, a mutation that allows cancer cells to resist a drug might also, say, slow their growth. This means that resistant cells only do better than their sensitive cousins in the presence of a drug Ã¢ÂÂ  under normal conditions, theyÃ¢ÂÂre less competitive. Doctors could potentially exploit this weakness by giving treatments in waves. Hit a tumor with a drug, and the sensitive cells die off while the resistant ones start to grow. Stop the drug, to let the sensitive cells bounce back. Rinse and repeat. The goal of this Ã¢ÂÂadaptive therapyÃ¢ÂÂ isnÃ¢ÂÂt to destroy the tumor, but to keep it in balance. Gatenby tried this approach on breast cancers in mice. By varying doses, he managed to control the growth of the animalsÃ¢ÂÂ tumors, despite frequently skipping treatments for weeks at a time. Other scientists are going after the evolutionary process itself. Swanton has shown that some kidney tumors have trunk mutations in a gene called SETD2 that helps to repair DNA damage. Ã¢ÂÂGenes like this maintain the integrity of the genome,Ã¢ÂÂ he explains. Mutating them doesnÃ¢ÂÂt lead to cancer directly, but it does nix a cellÃ¢ÂÂs ability to repair errors in its own DNA and ensures that further mutations accrue more quickly. In other words, these mutations make cells more evolvable. By targeting them, it might be possible to slow the evolution of cancers altogether. Even simple substances like aspirin might do the trick. This drug is known to reduce the risk of bowel, esophageal, and pancreatic cancers. Partly, this might be because it puts the brakes on a tumorÃ¢ÂÂs early evolution. In a study of people with BarrettÃ¢ÂÂs esophagus Ã¢ÂÂ  a condition that often leads to esophageal cancer Ã¢ÂÂ  Carlo Maley from Arizona State University found that mutations arise 13 times faster when people donÃ¢ÂÂt take aspirin than when they swallow the drug. Ã¢ÂÂThe study was small It was just 13 patients, and ideally, IÃ¢ÂÂd want to confirm it in a large cohort of people, half of whom are randomly given aspirin,Ã¢ÂÂ Maley admits. But he adds that the broader idea of averting evolution before it has a chance to get going Ã¢ÂÂ  and prevent cancers before drug resistance is even an issue Ã¢ÂÂ  is the right one. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre not trying to beat evolution but to manage it, which sounds plausible to me,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Ã¢ÂÂThe field is still dominated by cancer therapy but we should focus on cancer prevention. We should intervene before it becomes such a hard problem. Ã¢ÂÂ * * * The first results from their TRACERx study are finally published today in two companion papers. In the first, the team focused on the first 100 patients Ã¢ÂÂ  Brealey included Ã¢ÂÂ  of the 842 they have since recruited. Again, they found that each tumor is a world in itself. In total,   of the mutations they found were in the branches of the tumor, restricted only to particular parts of the mass. Some patients had just a handful of these branches. One had 2, 310. These mutations are like single typos in a book, but SwantonÃ¢ÂÂs team found evidence of larger chromosomal rearrangements Ã¢ÂÂ  the equivalent of entire paragraphs being duplicated, deleted, or rearranged. On average, these   changes affected half of a tumorÃ¢ÂÂs genome, and patients with high levels were five times more likely to experience recurrence than those with low levels. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs an incredibly complex disease,Ã¢ÂÂ says Swanton. Ã¢ÂÂIt has a lot more instability than what we saw in kidney cancer. Ã¢ÂÂ Worse still, this instability can rewire a lung cancerÃ¢ÂÂs evolutionary history, altering the trunk mutations that ought to be present and consistent throughout a tumor. In other words, as lung cancer evolves, the trunk can turn into branches, which means that going after the trunk mutations is unlikely to be lung cancerÃ¢ÂÂs downfall. Still, Swanton sees reason for hope. His team showed that many of these   changes are caused by a family of   enzymes called APOBEC. These are usually involved in immune responses, but seems to go rogue in lung cancer Ã¢ÂÂ  and several other types Ã¢ÂÂ  providing what Swanton calls Ã¢ÂÂmutagenic fuel for cancer evolution. Ã¢ÂÂ Even in heavy smokers, APOBEC enzymes can create even more mutations than the potent   chemicals in tobacco smoke. Ã¢ÂÂThere are multiple efforts going on around the globe to target the enzyme and arrest evolution in its tracks,Ã¢ÂÂ says Swanton. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm really excited about this. Ã¢ÂÂ Such efforts may take a long time to bear fruit, but the acceptance of cancerÃ¢ÂÂs evolutionary side is already changing how clinicians approach the disease. Doctors typically take a single biopsy of a patientÃ¢ÂÂs tumor at the time of diagnosis, and use that sample to make decisions about treatments, even if the tumor recurs. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs like using last decadeÃ¢ÂÂs stock information to guide tomorrowÃ¢ÂÂs investments. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂve accepted that profiling those archived tumors could be doing the patients a disservice,Ã¢ÂÂ says Samra Turajlic, one of SwantonÃ¢ÂÂs colleagues. Ã¢ÂÂWe now try to get the most recent and representative verison of the patientÃ¢ÂÂs disease. But biopsies wonÃ¢ÂÂt cut it Ã¢ÂÂ  itÃ¢ÂÂs impractical to keep on slicing chunks out of a patientÃ¢ÂÂs tumor over time, and as SwantonÃ¢ÂÂs work has shown, you need several such slices from different regions to really capture a tumorÃ¢ÂÂs diversity. Fortunately, thereÃ¢ÂÂs another option. In the second of the two TRACERx papers, SwantonÃ¢ÂÂs team showed that ctDNA provides an edifying look at lung cancer, too. In some cases, patients showed increasing levels of ctDNA immediately after surgery, showing that their tumors were bouncing back despite the chemotherapy that they were taking. In other cases, the   DNA revealed the presence of new branch mutations, suggesting that tumors were relapsing several months before they became visible on CT scans. It could act as a marker that reveals how cancers evolve in   and it could reveal the efficacy of measures designed to curb that evolution. As ever, there are caveats. Modern techniques for sequencing ctDNA are still too expensive to be used regularly in the clinic, and they arenÃ¢ÂÂt sensitive enough to detect cancers at their earliest stages. ItÃ¢ÂÂs also still unclear exactly how representative the floating DNA is of tumors as a whole. But Swanton thinks that these hurdles can be overcome. Ã¢ÂÂTen years from now, IÃ¢ÂÂd like to see us doing this regularly Ã¢ÂÂ  using circulating DNA to constantly monitor disease over space and time, and alter our therapies accordingly,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Five years ago, his big kidney cancer left him pessimistic and unsettled. But like the diseases he studies, he too has rebounded. Ã¢ÂÂI was pretty depressed when we first started on this route, but IÃ¢ÂÂve come out the other side,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Ã¢ÂÂAnd IÃ¢ÂÂve been getting pretty optimistic in the last couple of years. By understanding and embracing the complexity, we can fight it.

2095,", I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. Mary Elizabeth Williams was just 44, a staff writer at Salon and a mother of two who was freshly reunited with her husband (from whom she had separated two years earlier) when she noticed a bump about the size of a pencil eraser on her scalp. It didnÃ¢ÂÂt hurt. It didnÃ¢ÂÂt itch. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm sorry to tell you this,Ã¢ÂÂ her dermatologist said, Ã¢ÂÂbut you have malignant melanoma,Ã¢ÂÂ a cancer that kills some 10, 000 people annually. Back then, in 2010, her tumor was only Stage 2. But a year after it was removed Ã¢ÂÂ  along with a chunk of her scalp Ã¢ÂÂ  the disease came back. This time it was Stage 4 there is no Stage 5. Her   prognosis? She could have as little as six months to live. Then she got lucky: She qualified for a clinical trial at New YorkÃ¢ÂÂs Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, testing drugs that were supposed to harness a patientÃ¢ÂÂs immune system against the disease. As the first line of her new memoir reveals, Ã¢ÂÂSpoiler: I lived. Ã¢ÂÂ Written with candor, humor (Ã¢ÂÂDonÃ¢ÂÂt think of it as losing your hair Ã¢ÂÂ  think of it as a   Brazilian! Ã¢ÂÂ) and just the right amount of rage, WilliamsÃ¢ÂÂs book, A Series of Catastrophes and Miracles, is about the ravages of metastatic disease and the innovations of science, but itÃ¢ÂÂs equally about resilience. Most of all, perhaps, it is about womenÃ¢ÂÂs friendship: WilliamsÃ¢ÂÂs college roommate, Debbie, died of ovarian cancer right when Williams learned that she herself was cured. On the day Williams spoke with me, she had just lost another friend to cancer, a    law school graduate who had begun a treatment program similar to the one that had saved Williams. Ã¢ÂÂIt sucks,Ã¢ÂÂ she told me. Ã¢ÂÂIt fucking sucks. Ã¢ÂÂ Having been through treatment for breast cancer twice Ã¢ÂÂ  and lost my mother to pancreatic cancer earlier this year Ã¢ÂÂ  I understood that sentiment all too well. Here, Williams talks about living with   disease, her experience with the sometimes hollow,   culture of cancer activism, and how, despite all the bleakness, she found beauty. Orenstein: Many cancer memoirs are written by people with   disease who, no surprise, survive. How is your book different? Williams: Even within the cancer community, a lot of advocacy groups donÃ¢ÂÂt want to talk about people with Stage 4 disease. They want that inspirational story of Ã¢ÂÂI kicked cancerÃ¢ÂÂs butt!Ã¢ÂÂ If itÃ¢ÂÂs a darker scenario, or just a more complicated one, you are ignored. That frustrated me as a person and as a reader. I wasnÃ¢ÂÂt seeing stories about people who were living [with the disease] like I was. Orenstein: What was it like to find out that you had Stage 4 cancer? Williams: It was surreal. You leave your body for a time. When I hear about people who are Stage 4 for years   Ã¢ÂÂ¦     How do you basically live on death row never knowing whether youÃ¢ÂÂre going to get a reprieve from the governor or if youÃ¢ÂÂre going to get sent to the chair? And you canÃ¢ÂÂt just stop doing your regular life. You have to take care of your kids. You have to do your job. You have to do your laundry. Orenstein: You canÃ¢ÂÂt sit around and wait to die. Williams: Right. My kids and I got lice right after my second diagnosis. Maybe thatÃ¢ÂÂs why laundry is uppermost in my mind. I did so much laundry. And you want to do that everyday stuff, until you become really incapacitated. I certainly saw that with my friend Debbie. You want to hang out with your friends. You want to read a book. You want to do whatever you can. Orenstein: Do you feel survivor guilt over your friendÃ¢ÂÂs death? Williams: Years ago I went to a reading by an author who had served in Vietnam. I hate the whole battle metaphor, that cancer is like war, but he said something great. He said, Ã¢ÂÂYou go to basic training with these guys. You go in the trenches with them. You see every horror imaginable together. Then one day one of them gets a bullet through him and you donÃ¢ÂÂt. And youÃ¢ÂÂre happy. And then you live with that for the rest of your life. Ã¢ÂÂ ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what it is: ItÃ¢ÂÂs the guilt of being happy. I get to live my life. I get to listen to music and eat cake Ã¢ÂÂ  and Debbie doesnÃ¢ÂÂt. Of course I feel guilt. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs okay. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not my fault that I got sick or that I got better either, but I want to always respect that I have a privilege that so many, including people I loved, do not. Orenstein: WhatÃ¢ÂÂs the experimental therapy that is responsible for your being here? Williams: Immunotherapy is different from conventional cancer treatment Ã¢ÂÂ  surgery, radiation, and chemo Ã¢ÂÂ  which will probably one day be looked back on as barbaric. The way that cancer works is that it scrambles the signals of your bodyÃ¢ÂÂs defenses and confuses your immune system, allowing the mutant cells to multiply. What immunotherapy does is override that confusion so your [your immune system goes] after the cancer anyway. There are different kinds of immunotherapy. There are vaccines in development. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs adoptive   transfers, where a patientÃ¢ÂÂs cells are collected,   and then reintroduced into the body to fight cancer. ItÃ¢ÂÂs brilliant, but you can understand why discovering this took decades of trial and error. And a lot of immune therapy comes out of the lessons of other forms of immune treatment, including AIDS research. Orenstein: How quickly did it work for you? Williams: A tumor had grown on my back, and after my first treatment, I could actually see it shrinking. [Now that the FDA has approved this drug therapy,] the next challenge is figuring out why it works for some of us and not for others. During treatment I put up a poster in my bedroom that says, Ã¢ÂÂWhen the odds are a million to one, be the one. Ã¢ÂÂ But you know what? I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to be the only Ã¢ÂÂone. Ã¢ÂÂ Orenstein: You were raising two kids while going through all this. How did you handle being both a patient and a parent? Williams: My husband and I were always transparent with the kids. They saw me cry they saw me get scared. We used words like died rather than passed away. Now I see the kids as these amazing, compassionate,   people who know how to comfort others and who have made space in their life for death. That is so unusual in our culture. I want my kids to have a relationship with the fluidity of life Ã¢ÂÂ  with the fact that sometimes people get sick and sometimes bad things happen, and to know that within that there is also grace, thereÃ¢ÂÂs also beauty, thereÃ¢ÂÂs also comfort. Because if you go down into the depths, there is treasure there. Cancer still sucks, but thereÃ¢ÂÂs also profound connection. ItÃ¢ÂÂs the privilege of allowing yourself to participate in the full experience of humanity, which includes grief and sickness and death. If you donÃ¢ÂÂt look at [those things] youÃ¢ÂÂre not living. Orenstein: At the same time, you never romanticize illness in the book. And from the day you show up at the doctorÃ¢ÂÂs in a   that says FUCK CANCER, you resist what I think of as the tyranny of the positive attitude. Williams: ThereÃ¢ÂÂs this assumption that because you got better, you did it courageously. But thatÃ¢ÂÂs not my story. I didnÃ¢ÂÂt Ã¢ÂÂwarriorÃ¢ÂÂ my way into getting better. It was not my achievement it was scienceÃ¢ÂÂs. Whenever I hear someone say Ã¢ÂÂI beat cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ it just feels so disrespectful to others, such as my friend Debbie. It divides us into winners and losers. I know itÃ¢ÂÂs not deliberate. We want to make meaning. We want to make sense of it. But you see how random [survival] is. I have known people who were healthier than me and younger than me who tried, I think, harder than I did to fight their cancer but who didnÃ¢ÂÂt live. Orenstein: Tell me the significance of the butterfly on the cover of your book. Williams: The story is about losing something Ã¢ÂÂ  yourself, people you loved, what you thought you knew about the world Ã¢ÂÂ  yet still being whole. Butterflies are all about transformation. I try to see the beauty in all the damage. I try to see the beauty in all the ruin. And I definitely see the love.             Like this?

2096,"   I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. In the northwest coast of Spain, a delicious clam called the golden carpet shell is suffering from an extraordinary type of cancer Ã¢ÂÂ  a contagious leukemia.   Almost every other case of cancer in animals Ã¢ÂÂ  including humans Ã¢ÂÂ  begins when a single cell in an individual starts growing and dividing uncontrollably, producing a tumor. If the tumor kills its host, it dies too. But the clamÃ¢ÂÂs leukemia is caused by cancer cells that have become independent parasites they can travel between individuals, creating fresh tumors in each new host. And if that wasnÃ¢ÂÂt astonishing enough, this transmissible tumor didnÃ¢ÂÂt even originate in a golden carpet shell. Instead, its genes reveal that it first arose in a related species Ã¢ÂÂ  the pullet shell. ItÃ¢ÂÂs the first known cancer that not only jumps into new hosts but has, at least once, leapt over the species barrier. Some cancers are caused by contagious things like HPV, the virus that causes cervical cancer, or Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium that causes stomach cancer. But in these cases, the tumor cells themselves stay put. ItÃ¢ÂÂs so exceptional for cancers to become infectious in their own right that until a year ago, scientists knew of only two types that did so. One is a facial tumor that infects Tasmanian devils. It evolved recently, spreads through bites, and threatens the future of its hosts. The second is a far older veneral tumor that affects dogs. It arose 11, 000 years ago and has spread to six continents. A third example emerged last year. Along North AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs east coast,   clams were dying from a strange type of leukemia. Michael Metzger and Stephen Goff,  scientists from Columbia University, studied these cancers and found that they were all genetically identical to each other, but genetically distinct from their hosts. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the same pattern seen in the Tasmanian devil and dog tumors Ã¢ÂÂ  a  clear sign that these cancers arrive in their hosts, rather than originating from them. They drift through the sea, these selfish shellfish cells, traveling from one   clam to another. Intrigued, Metzger and Goff polled their marine biologist colleagues and learned that many other shellfish species are afflicted by similar rapidly spreading leukemias. They collected cockles and golden carpet shell clams from the coast of Spain, and mussels from the coast of Vancouver. In all three cases, they found the same signature pattern: a genetic match between all the tumors, and a mismatch between each tumor and its respective host. Ã¢ÂÂPrior to this, we believed that transmissible cancers were bizarre flukes of nature that happened due to a set of unfortunate coincidences in very unlucky species,Ã¢ÂÂ says Elizabeth Murchison, a University of Cambridge cancer researcher who studies the Tasmanian devil tumor. Instead, they are Ã¢ÂÂprobably relatively common, at least some bivalves, and the processes whereby cancers become transmissible are not as rare as we previously thought. Ã¢ÂÂ Indeed, Metzger and Goff found that cockles have given risen to two strains of contagious cancer. Their tumors belonged to two distinctive lineages, each of which seems to have independently arisen from a different healthy cell. That explains why the same disease presents in two distinct ways, characterized by cells that look different under the microscope. Ã¢ÂÂPeople noted that, said, Ã¢ÂÂIsnÃ¢ÂÂt that odd?Ã¢ÂÂ and moved on,Ã¢ÂÂ says Goff. Ã¢ÂÂThis explains the mystery. Ã¢ÂÂ   ThereÃ¢ÂÂs precedent for a dual origin. Earlier this year, Murchison showed that the Tasmanian devilÃ¢ÂÂs contagious tumor also arose twice. Ã¢ÂÂWe absolutely couldnÃ¢ÂÂt believe it,Ã¢ÂÂ she told me at the time. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs the last thing I could have possibly imagined. Ã¢ÂÂ It might now be the    thing. A bigger surprise came when Metzger and Goff studied the golden carpet shells. Their tumors were not just genetically distinct from their hosts, but wildly so, with matches as low as 78 percent for certain critical genes. Ã¢ÂÂThey werenÃ¢ÂÂt even close,Ã¢ÂÂ says Goff. Ã¢ÂÂWe then realized they were a near perfect match to the cells of another species, the pullet shell. Ã¢ÂÂ The cells must have originated there before jumping into the golden carpets. Oddly, the pullet shells themselves show no signs of the cancer. They may have given rise to it, but they no longer suffer from it. Why? Ã¢ÂÂOne could imagine that the    is now resistant to the tumor,Ã¢ÂÂ says Goff, Ã¢ÂÂbut we donÃ¢ÂÂt know that. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂIt would be good to know how the tumors are transmitted in nature,Ã¢ÂÂ says Clare Rebbeck, from the University of Cambridge.  On land, devils and dogs can only spread their tumors by biting and mating. In the water, Goff thinks that transmission might be far easier. The infected mollusks release cancer cells in their feces, so every time they poop, they seed the water with transmissible tumors. And since they are   that sieve through huge volumes of seawater, they are also   to picking up the cells from their neighbors. This might also explain why shellfish seem to be so uniquely susceptible to contagious cancers. Goff guesses that their immune systems are involved, too. Human immune systems would usually stop incompatible foreign cells from setting up shop in our bodies thatÃ¢ÂÂs why people have to take immunosuppressive drugs before receiving organ transplants. Ã¢ÂÂThe most fascinating aspect of transmissible cancers is their ability to avoid those immune responses,Ã¢ÂÂ says Hannah Siddle from the University of Southampton. Ã¢ÂÂAnd the transmission of cells across a species barrier is even more striking. Ã¢ÂÂ Fortunately Ã¢ÂÂ  for us, if not the clams and mussels Ã¢ÂÂ  thereÃ¢ÂÂs no evidence that these cells could affect humans, or that we are plagued by any contagious cancer at all. Ã¢ÂÂI would only worry deeply if I was a mollusk,Ã¢ÂÂ Goff says. Ã¢ÂÂCould it happen in rare circumstances? WeÃ¢ÂÂd be eager to look for that. It would presumably have to happen between genetically closely matched peers, or people who are profoundly  . Ã¢ÂÂ Still, his discovery adds to the growing realization that contagious cancers are more common than anyone assumed. There are now eight of them, and they are organisms unlike anything else. Since time immemorial, people have dreamed of immortality. WeÃ¢ÂÂve filled our fiction with vampires, elves, fountains of youth, horcruxes, and the Singularity. Well, in the real world, this is what immortality looks like. Each of these eight contagious cancers represents a single animal Ã¢ÂÂ  a dog, two Tasmanian devils, and a handful shellfish Ã¢ÂÂ  whose original body is long dead, but that lives on as dynasties of cells that propagate in new hosts.",cancer,The Contagious Cancer That Jumped Between Species,2096.0,2096.0,96.0,

Democratic Representative Mark Takai of Hawaii died Wednesday, two months after announcing he wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt seek a second term in Congress. Takai, 49, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer last fall, and in the following months, he channeled his personal experiences into advocacy for cancer research. He was a strong supporter of Vice President BidenÃ¢ÂÂs cancer Ã¢ÂÂmoonshotÃ¢ÂÂ initiative and a member of two   caucuses in the House of Representatives. A Victory For Voting Rights in Texas, Takai initially planned to continue campaigning despite his diagnosis and announced a reelection campaign this past winter. But in May, Takai revealed his cancer had spread and he was dropping out of the race. According to Honolulu Civil Beat, former Representative Colleen Hanabusa was an Ã¢ÂÂearly favoriteÃ¢ÂÂ to fill his seat when she formally declared her candidacy in June, and Takai supported her bid. The seat is safely blue. Ã¢ÂÂIn life, we often make plans for ourselves,Ã¢ÂÂ Takai said when he revealed his plans not to run for reelection. Ã¢ÂÂI had envisioned a long career in the U. S. House of Representatives, building up the seniority and influence that were key to Senator [Daniel] InouyeÃ¢ÂÂs ability to deliver for Hawaii.   Ã¢ÂÂ¦     But as often happens, we find ourselves on a different journey than what we had planned. Ã¢ÂÂ In a statement Wednesday, his family thanked their fellow islanders for their support, and asked for privacy. Although Takai spent less than one full term in Congress, he was a longtime public servant. He worked for two decades in the Hawaii statehouse and was a lieutenant colonel in the Hawaii Army National Guard. Ã¢ÂÂIn his service to America and the people of Hawaii, Congressman Takai embodied our nationÃ¢ÂÂs highest ideals,Ã¢ÂÂ House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement Wednesday. Ã¢ÂÂIn his fight against cancer, Mark showed the courage and strength that defined the wonderful person he was. Ã¢ÂÂ Those sentiments were echoed by his other colleagues Wednesday as they learned the news, as The Washington Post reports.",cancer,A Hawaii Congressman Dies After a Months-Long Cancer Fight,2098.0,2098.0,98.0,
2099,"   I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. Salmonella bacteria are best known as a causes of food poisoning and typhoid fever. Every year, they sicken millions of people. But those in Jeff HastyÃ¢ÂÂs lab at the University of California, San Diego, are different. TheyÃ¢ÂÂve been neutered and modified so that rather than causing   they kill tumors. HastyÃ¢ÂÂs team has engineered the microbes to produce a variety of   drugs, and to   when they reach a certain density. In their death throes, the bacteria release their toxic payloads to kill the tumor cells around them. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs like a kamikaze mission,Ã¢ÂÂ says Hasty. But not all the bacteria die. About 10 percent of them survive and can   the population, triggering many more rounds of   and drug delivery. These engineered microbes have only been tested in laboratory cells and mice. Needless to say, there are many unresolved questions about safety and efficiency, and this preliminary approach is a long way from being a legitimate cancer treatment. But thatÃ¢ÂÂs almost not the point. What Hasty has created is a probiotic on a timer Ã¢ÂÂ  or rather, with a snooze button. HeÃ¢ÂÂs proved that itÃ¢ÂÂs possible to engineer bacteria to produce and release drugs at regular intervals, to the beat of a genetic metronome that he can set. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs useful not just for cancer, but for diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure that require regular doses of medicine. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs going to open up opportunities more general than cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ says Hasty. ItÃ¢ÂÂs part of a growing number of attempts to turn the bacteria that share our lives Ã¢ÂÂ  the microbiome Ã¢ÂÂ  into medical assistants. Scientists and doctors have been trying to use bacteria to fight cancer for more than a century. In 1891, the surgeon William Coley infected cancer patients with Streptoccocus, thinking that the microbes would trigger an immune response that would also destroy the cancer cells. Coley treated over a thousand people in this way, and although some recovered, others didnÃ¢ÂÂt. Amid mixed results, the approach fell into neglect. It resurfaced when doctors started realizing that tumors were not sterile, as had long been thought, but often contains multitudes of microbes. The   bacteria that thrive in our gut can readily grow in the interior of tumors, which are similarly low in oxygen and sheltered from patrolling immune cells. The presence of such microbes was attractive to scientists because one of the big challenges in cancer medicine is actually getting drugs into tumours in the first place. If   microbes could be engineered to make those drugs, they could be the perfect Trojan horses. First, you need to pick the right microbe. Salmonella is a good choice. It can survive without oxygen and readily accumulates in tumors. ItÃ¢ÂÂs also closely related to Escherichia coli, the favoued bacterium of the modern biologist. Which means that all the techniques that geneticists have developed for engineering E. coli can be used to modify Salmonella too. Ã¢ÂÂWe can quickly leverage an enormous toolbox,Ã¢ÂÂ says Hasty. But, wait Ã¢ÂÂ  bacteria are living things. They grow. They multiply. They trigger immune responses. Other scientists have tested engineered strains of   Salmonella, with poor results. Ã¢ÂÂWe killed our mice,Ã¢ÂÂ says Seigfried Weiss from the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research. Ã¢ÂÂThey had such a high load of bacteria that they probably suffered a toxic shock. Ã¢ÂÂ So if you want to use Salmonella to shuttle drugs into tumors, you need some way of controlling their numbers. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what HastyÃ¢ÂÂs team, led by student Omar Din, developed. They started with a   strain of Salmonella that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt cause disease, and gave it the ability to make an   drug. They also added genes that   viruses use to destroy their victims, and cleverly wired these up to genes that Salmonella and other bacteria use to sense each other. The result is a   microbe with   population control. Once the population hits a certain size, 90 percent of the cells rupture synchronously, releasing their cargo. The survivors can then repopulate, and the whole cycle beings again, like clockwork. Of course, Ã¢ÂÂyouÃ¢ÂÂre still putting in a live Salmonella strain,Ã¢ÂÂ says Beth McCormick from the University of Massachusetts Medical School. They might be neutered but theyÃ¢ÂÂre still bacteria, and they could still trigger inflammation and other immune problems. Ã¢ÂÂBut these synchronized circuits allow a persistent but low state of infection, which might overcome the issue with immune responses. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a great preliminary step. Ã¢ÂÂ The   approach doesnÃ¢ÂÂt just stop the bacteria from  . It also delivers a big pulse of a drug directly to the site of a tumor. And it makes it easy to program the bacteria to release many kinds of drugs. HastyÃ¢ÂÂs team tested three: a   toxin that bores into mammalian cells, a substance that stimulates the immune system, and one that causes cancer cells to commit suicide. The teamÃ¢ÂÂs colleagues, led by Sangeeta Bhatia at MIT, then tested these microbes in mice with incurable tumors that had spread to their livers. On their own, the bacteria did no better than a standard chemotherapy drug. But when the team used both together, the tumors shrank by a third and the mice lived 50 percent longer. That makes sense, says Hasty. Ã¢ÂÂSalmonella can grow in the   region inside the tumor, where chemotherapy isnÃ¢ÂÂt as effective. The bacteria get behind enemy lines and work from the inside out while the chemotherapy works at the growing rim of the tumour. Ã¢ÂÂ ThatÃ¢ÂÂs promising, but there are many kinks to iron out. If the bacteria were ever to be tested in humans, theyÃ¢ÂÂd need more safety features to stop them from growing, spreading, or mutating unpredictably. TheyÃ¢ÂÂd need to be more effective, too the teamÃ¢ÂÂs mice initially benefited from their microbial injections but their tumors started growing again after three weeks. Ã¢ÂÂThere are many things that need to be worked out before we think about testing these things in humans,Ã¢ÂÂ says Hasty. Ã¢ÂÂI want to show some restraint. Ã¢ÂÂ HeÃ¢ÂÂs right to do so. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs a long history of medical techniques that seemed exciting in mice but that faceplanted in people. For example, in the late 1990s, David Bermudes from California State University also developed Salmonella strains that could shuttle drugs into tumours. These fared well in mice and monkeys, but when they were eventually tested in human clinical trials, they didnÃ¢ÂÂt work. Ã¢ÂÂWe could show safety but there was no measurable   activity,Ã¢ÂÂ says Bermudes. Ã¢ÂÂIn mice, the bacteria targeted a wide range of tumors 100 percent of the time. In the human study, they targeted tumors just a third of the time and only at the highest dose. We all know mice donÃ¢ÂÂt predict tumor therapies, or weÃ¢ÂÂd have cured cancer already. Ã¢ÂÂ Still, Bermudes thinks the approach has merit, as do many other scientists. Some are trying to program Salmonella to release toxins after invading cancer cells directly. Others are modifying the bacterium to release substances that either remove the shields that cloak cancer cells from the immune system, or that activate immune cells directly. Ã¢ÂÂOne of the problems in using bacteria against tumors was the lack of acceptance by oncologists,Ã¢ÂÂ says Weiss. Ã¢ÂÂVery few groups worked on it. But slowly, more are getting interested. New ideas will fertilize the field, and IÃ¢ÂÂm sure that eventually, this will bring bacterial therapy into the clinics.

Please follow the steps below, Imagine for a moment that you have a tiny but worrisome lung nodule or, say, a growing bulge in a crucial blood vessel. You have no choice but to continue with normal life: going to work, running errands, paying taxes, negotiating with your kids over screen time. But youÃ¢ÂÂre always living, at least to some degree, under the looming shadow of a medical question mark. Judy Refuerzo ventured further along that uncertain journey this summer, walking the full length of the Camino de Santiago Ã¢ÂÂ  some 500 miles and 38 days across the Pyrenees into Spain Ã¢ÂÂ  to commemorate her 60th birthday. It had been a   trek, one that she tackled with a backpack and a close girlfriend for company. SheÃ¢ÂÂs not in denial, she insists, about the malignant cells that doctors found in her breast nearly two years ago. SheÃ¢ÂÂs been getting regular imaging tests to make sure that the cells Ã¢ÂÂ  collectively called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or sometimes stage 0 breast cancer Ã¢ÂÂ  have not migrated beyond the milk ducts. But the California yoga teacher has decided against any kind of treatment, including surgery Ã¢ÂÂ  at least for now. Ã¢ÂÂI just donÃ¢ÂÂt want to be cut open for no reason,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. In the process, Judy has joined a growing group of   watchful waiters, snared within a   web of aggressive testing and medical uncertainty. The concept of watchful waiting (synonymous, for some doctors at least, with Ã¢ÂÂactive surveillanceÃ¢ÂÂ) is nothing new. Through the ages, doctors have sometimes recommended hitting pause on treatment. Increasingly, though, more and more people are caught up in a peculiar medical purgatory, particularly in countries like the U. S. A. where an emphasis on screening and   imaging to rule out medical problems can cascade into more testing and other uncertainties. Ã¢ÂÂI think our technologies are moving faster than our ability to know what to do with the conditions we find,Ã¢ÂÂ says Shelley Hwang, a breast surgeon at Duke University Medical Center and a prominent DCIS researcher. Ã¢ÂÂAnd once you know it, you canÃ¢ÂÂt   it. Ã¢ÂÂ Sometimes, as in JudyÃ¢ÂÂs situation, people will choose that    path. While still quite controversial, some doctors are willing to delay surgery and other treatment for DCIS unless there are signs that the malignant cells are moving into the surrounding breast tissue. In other medical scenarios, patients are told   that monitoring is the only immediate option, as itÃ¢ÂÂs too risky to operate until circumstances become more  . Medicine has reached a crossroads. Shadows, nodules, and other changes can be flagged much earlier, in the      stage. Meanwhile, researchers and clinicians are learning that, for some conditions, less medical care might be better, both in the short term and also possibly over the longer haul. Even some cancer cells, it seems, can flare and fade away. But that shift in medical thinking raises other big questions: Are some people more psychologically able to cope with medical limbo? Can clinicians identify which patients might better weather uncertainty? And how do doctors counteract that innate human desire to Ã¢ÂÂdo something,Ã¢ÂÂ not only in their patients, but in themselves? * * * Ã¢ÂÂPeople donÃ¢ÂÂt like this idea of watching,Ã¢ÂÂ says Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco. Ã¢ÂÂThe whole fact that weÃ¢ÂÂve told you to watch   Ã¢ÂÂ¦     makes you feel like something bad is going to happen. Ã¢ÂÂ Even though, she says, a lot of things that are watched will never progress, there is a drop in a personÃ¢ÂÂs quality of life when they get into a surveillance situation. If she chose to, Redberg could tout medical credentials that run for pages. SheÃ¢ÂÂs a   cardiology researcher, a vocal opponent of inappropriate imaging, and the chief editor of JAMA Internal Medicine. In the late 1970s, she and her fellow medical students were learning how to perform a physical exam, which meant practicing on each other. One student found a lump in RedbergÃ¢ÂÂs neck, which Ã¢ÂÂ  after more than two decades of monitoring with blood tests Ã¢ÂÂ  was eventually biopsied in 2000. It was papillary thyroid cancer, the most common form of thyroid cancer. Soon after, she had surgery. If she had had her biopsy today, Redberg might have had another, albeit controversial, option: to simply monitor her cancer. Surveillance has long been considered an option for   prostate cancer, and now researchers are exploring its use in other cancers, including papillary thyroid, which is, very often, so   that someone can fare well for years without it spreading. Another is DCIS, JudyÃ¢ÂÂs diagnosis. As mammography and other imaging has become more common and more sensitive, diagnoses of DCIS now make up as many as a quarter of breast cancer diagnoses. Previously, it was virtually unheard of. The question is: how risky is it to leave those cells alone? Since few women choose surveillance, research answers are limited. But a recent look back at patients treated in Boston proved encouraging. After ten years, over 98 percent of women hadnÃ¢ÂÂt died from their   DCIS, whether they had had surgery or not. While the cancer outcomes are crucial, the impact on someoneÃ¢ÂÂs quality of life shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be ignored. Some women who choose surgery, radiation, and other measures for DCIS might struggle with related pain and recovery for some time, Hwang says. But without surgery, she counters, Ã¢ÂÂthereÃ¢ÂÂs another flavor of misery where youÃ¢ÂÂre just worried every day of your life that youÃ¢ÂÂre going to get cancerÃ¢ÂÂ. Hwang is leading the first   randomized DCIS study in the USA, known as the COMET trial, which will analyze cancer rates as well as the psychological ripple effects. Psychological and    aspects also are part of a similarly designed study called LORIS, which was launched in 2014 in the UK. Prior research shows that women with DCIS harbor similar fears about recurrence and dying as those who have invasive breast cancer, despite DCIS being less serious. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂve got a lot of worry going on, and we donÃ¢ÂÂt even know if the treatment that theyÃ¢ÂÂre receiving actually is of any value to them at all,Ã¢ÂÂ says Lesley Fallowfield, the principal investigator on the LORIS studyÃ¢ÂÂs    assessment. During discussions after her 2014 diagnosis, JudyÃ¢ÂÂs doctors recommended a myriad of treatment approaches Ã¢ÂÂ  mastectomy, lumpectomy, radiation, and tamoxifen Ã¢ÂÂ  in various combinations to prevent the malignant cells from spreading. Finally, a surgeon suggested that Judy talk to doctors at the University of California, San Francisco, early proponents of monitoring as an alternative strategy. Ã¢ÂÂHe said, Ã¢ÂÂThey have a different view of DCIS than the rest of the world,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Judy recalls. As she mulled over her options, Judy worried about the risk of surgery and radiation, including   discomfort and possible    . Plus, no one could guarantee her that the malignant breast cells would be eradicated for good. Do I want to live my life healthy and feeling good, she asked herself, or miserable and not feeling good, with the same outcome? Judy, who already avoided meat, has made other changes to her diet since her diagnosis, dropping wheat and dairy. SheÃ¢ÂÂs also taking vitamin D to supplement her low natural levels. She believes that many of us periodically harbour malignancies somewhere in our bodies, cells that can be beaten back with exercise, nutrition and other healthy habits. But she also admits to flickers of doubt: Ã¢ÂÂOccasionally IÃ¢ÂÂll think, Ã¢ÂÂWhy do I think IÃ¢ÂÂm special? Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ * * * Theresa Monck, a    from Brooklyn, New York, is soaking up her first years of retirement, especially the opportunities to travel. But her next lung scan lurks in the back of her mind. The former smoker started getting annual CT scans in 2013 to look for any early signs of lung cancer. Two small nodules were identified. Over the last several years they have not grown, a reassuring sign. Still, Theresa has pushed for a biopsy. Doctors, she says, have told her that the nodules are too small to risk the procedure, which involves inserting a needle into her lung. Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt like having them  Ã¢ÂÂ¦    Ã¢ÂÂ she says. Ã¢ÂÂBut what am I going to do?Ã¢ÂÂ Theresa and patients like her are providing some insights into just how much angst men and women living in medical limbo really suffer. In 2013, the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended   screening for   current and former smokers. (European countries have been slower to conduct such screening outside of research studies, which are ongoing.) The goal is to find cancers at an earlier and likely more treatable stage. But thereÃ¢ÂÂs a significant catch. Anywhere from 20 to 50 percent of people, depending on the study cited, will have to deal with a false positive, where a nodule is found that, after further testing and scrutiny, doesnÃ¢ÂÂt prove to be cancerous. Sometimes patients wonÃ¢ÂÂt know one way or the other for years, but will continue to undergo imaging to see if the nodule is growing. For some people monitoring can morph into an endless loop, says Renda Soylemez Wiener, a pulmonologist at Boston University School of Medicine. While the typical guidance is to stop after several years if the nodule hasnÃ¢ÂÂt changed, this regular scanning can highlight another nodule, and the clock starts over. Ã¢ÂÂPatients wind up in this prolonged period of uncertainty,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. How much distress those scans generate, though, is still not clear. One study tracked just over 2, 800 participants in the U. S.  National Lung Screening Trial. Researchers found that those who had a suspicious nodule detected (and later ruled out) didnÃ¢ÂÂt suffer any more anxiety than those whose imaging tests didnÃ¢ÂÂt turn up anything. Joanne Marshall, a former smoker, is among those who might have reason to fuss. Her mother was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2012. Soon after, Joanne got her first scan, which identified three small nodules. But they havenÃ¢ÂÂt grown and neither has her concern. Ã¢ÂÂSome people can be nervous nellies Ã¢ÂÂ  thatÃ¢ÂÂs just not me,Ã¢ÂÂ says the    who lives near Los Angeles. Ã¢ÂÂI need to watch it because I would like to have a fighting chance, and I canÃ¢ÂÂt take back the smoking history. Ã¢ÂÂ But Wiener says her research shows that not everyone is similarly sanguine if a nodule is found. Sometimes patients act as though theyÃ¢ÂÂve already been diagnosed with lung cancer, she says. A woman in one of her studies quit her job to find another that would allow more time with her family. In another study, Wiener assessed the perceptions of 122 veterans whose nodules had been picked up in the course of checking out another potential medical problem. Nearly 40 percent reported at least mild distress after the nodule was identified 16 percent described their distress as moderate to severe. And even when a doctor says that CT scans are no longer necessary, 29 percent of patients report being Ã¢ÂÂsomewhat nervousÃ¢ÂÂ to stop surveillance, and 10 percent would be Ã¢ÂÂextremely nervous. Ã¢ÂÂ Theresa, the Brooklyn retiree, had a similar reaction when she learned that clinicians typically donÃ¢ÂÂt follow nodules that havenÃ¢ÂÂt changed for longer than several years. SheÃ¢ÂÂd continue the CT scans, she maintains, even if she had to go to another hospital, and even if her insurance wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt cover them and she had to pay herself. How else would she know if one of those nodules ever began to grow? Theresa and Joanne both carry several small, relatively   nodules in their lungs. Yet their reactions have been notably different. Fallowfield, the principal investigator on the LORIS studyÃ¢ÂÂs    assessment, says research indicates that we all have personality filters through which we sift medical information, sometimes in surprising ways. Years back, Fallowfield was involved with a study which looked at the processing styles of 154 women wrestling with the weighty decision of whether or not to have prophylactic surgery to remove both breasts. Just over half of the women Ã¢ÂÂ  all of whom faced a high risk of breast cancer based on family history or other risk factors Ã¢ÂÂ  chose surgery. Most of the rest declined, with a small number delaying their decision for various reasons. Understandably, both groups reported high anxiety at the start. But among those who chose the double mastectomy, those feelings Ã¢ÂÂby and largeÃ¢ÂÂ eased over the course of 18 months, Fallowfield says. But they didnÃ¢ÂÂt among those women who opted for surveillance. How could that be? Researchers found some indications in a Ã¢ÂÂways of copingÃ¢ÂÂ questionnaire that they had asked both groups to fill out in order to gauge how they handled lifeÃ¢ÂÂs difficulties. The women who chose surgery tended to have a more proactive,   approach, and likely that helped ease their anxiety moving forward, says Fallowfield. The women who declined were prone to using Ã¢ÂÂdetachment or distraction as a way of coping with lifeÃ¢ÂÂs traumas,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. Ã¢ÂÂThese were       people. Ã¢ÂÂ But that coping mechanism had a crucial flaw. Imaging tests and   kept reminding them of their cancer vulnerability. Suzanne Miller, a clinical health psychologist who studies medical   believes that the U. K. women who turned down the operation fall into a subset known as Ã¢ÂÂmonitors,Ã¢ÂÂ one of two coping styles that she first described in the late 1970s. The others Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂbluntersÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ  prefer to engage with medical details and discussions on an   basis. Ã¢ÂÂThey hear what theyÃ¢ÂÂre told,Ã¢ÂÂ she says, but are not inclined to dig further. Monitors are more likely to do research before an appointment and pepper the doctor with questions. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre also more likely to amplify any medical risks, which can become stressful if they decide on surveillance for a condition such as DCIS, Miller says. They may choose it Ã¢ÂÂon the basis of the rational, concrete pros and cons,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. Ã¢ÂÂBut many of them understand going into it that this is going to have an emotional toll. Ã¢ÂÂ In recent years, Miller has come to believe that monitors can be divided even further by coping style. Ã¢ÂÂ  monitorsÃ¢ÂÂ likely havenÃ¢ÂÂt taken steps to mitigate the emotional toll between scans and  . They might continue to fret and stew, which can snowball into regret that they havenÃ¢ÂÂt taken a more Ã¢ÂÂactiveÃ¢ÂÂ step, Miller says. Hence the pervasive anxiety suffered by the women who turned down prophylactic mastectomy in FallowfieldÃ¢ÂÂs study. Another example is men with   prostate cancer who initially commit to surveillance, but eventually go under the knife because they canÃ¢ÂÂt stand the uncertainty. Judy Refuerzo is what Miller describes as a Ã¢ÂÂstrategic monitor,Ã¢ÂÂ someone who relies on support,   and other strategies to dampen their own monitoring tendencies. Along with boosting her nutrition and striving to live life to the max Ã¢ÂÂ  Judy says sheÃ¢ÂÂs probably a bit more spontaneous these days Ã¢ÂÂ  she tries not to think too much about her cancer risk. Yet she still has scans every six months. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm under surveillance,Ã¢ÂÂ Judy says. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm not an idiot Ã¢ÂÂ  IÃ¢ÂÂm proactive. Ã¢ÂÂ In February 2016, JudyÃ¢ÂÂs most recent MRI scan showed some DCIS growth, but no signs of invasive cancer. * * * MillerÃ¢ÂÂs tool, the Monitor Ã¢ÂÂ  Blunter Style Scale, is one way that clinicians can get a snapshot of a patientÃ¢ÂÂs coping style. It would also be helpful if a doctor could capture a sense of an individual patientÃ¢ÂÂs risk tolerance, says Shelley Hwang, the Duke breast cancer surgeon Ã¢ÂÂ  something similar, she says, to how financial planners assess whether their client is capable of or interested in taking on additional financial risk. Patients and doctors caught in this cycle of surveillance are fighting one of the most innate human tendencies: the desire to act, says Paul Han, a physician and researcher who studies medical uncertainty and risk communication. That impulse can infect far more mundane situations than expanding aortic aneurysms or   cancers, Han says, noting that every day doctors must decide whether to prescribe antibiotics to patients with respiratory symptoms. Ã¢ÂÂEverybody wants something done, when in fact often nothing is really needed except observation and letting things run their course,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Ã¢ÂÂBut there is this sort of general impatience in our medical culture, and in our culture at large. Ã¢ÂÂ Han speculates that this discomfort with watchful waiting might figure more prominently in the U. S. A. than in countries in Europe and elsewhere where conversations about healthcare costs and   are more publicly hashed out. Fallowfield agrees, wondering if the U. S.  DCIS study (COMET) might struggle more than the U. K. one she works on (LORIS) to recruit patients willing to have their treatment randomly assigned, as Americans tend to be Ã¢ÂÂless  Ã¢ÂÂ. Fallowfield also echoes other clinicians who worry that misleading medical language can unduly alarm patients, ramping up their perception of their own risk status and thus influencing their treatment choices. When talking to LORIS study participants, clinicians use the term Ã¢ÂÂactive monitoringÃ¢ÂÂ rather than Ã¢ÂÂwatchful waiting. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂWatchful waitingÃ¢ÂÂ sounds quite passive Ã¢ÂÂ  you are sitting there waiting for something to happen,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. Using the term Ã¢ÂÂductal carcinoma in situÃ¢ÂÂ is similarly like waving a red flag in front of patients, Fallowfield says, because it includes the word Ã¢ÂÂcarcinoma. Ã¢ÂÂ If keeping DCIS as an acronym is important, she suggests other terminology, such as Ã¢ÂÂductal changes in situÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂductal calcifications in situ. Ã¢ÂÂ In the prostate field, thereÃ¢ÂÂs an analogous diagnosis to DCIS, a   condition called   prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. ItÃ¢ÂÂs the word Ã¢ÂÂneoplasiaÃ¢ÂÂ that Ã¢ÂÂcan set off patient alarm bells,Ã¢ÂÂ says Ian Thompson, a prostate cancer researcher in San Antonio, Texas. Ã¢ÂÂDidnÃ¢ÂÂt Ralph Nader call the Corvair unsafe at any speed? The terminology does affect behavior. Ã¢ÂÂ Thompson and other clinicians have proposed a less   albeit clunky, alternative: IDLE, short for indolent lesions of epithelial origin. To reduce patient fears, clinicians should do a better job at communicating medical risk, says Renda Soylemez Wiener, the Boston pulmonologist. She points out that just   of 244 patients diagnosed with lung nodules were able to predict with any degree of accuracy the likelihood that their nodules would prove to be cancerous. Overall they pegged their risk at 20 percent, but their actual risk based on nodule size was 7 percent. Nearly   of them didnÃ¢ÂÂt realize that some lung nodules grow so slowly that they will never prove to be  . A surveillance contract could also help avert patient Ã¢ÂÂ  doctor misunderstandings, says Brendan Stack, Jr, an Arkansas thyroid cancer specialist. A written agreement for patients considering thyroid monitoring could ensure an upfront discussion of the risks involved, he says. It could also lay out the circumstances under which the patientÃ¢ÂÂs decision would be revisited. Once a patient has Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ that surveillance is the best course, it can be difficult to convince them to deviate, even if the malignancy shows signs of becoming more aggressive, says Thompson. Ã¢ÂÂChanging horses from doing nothing to something is sometimes difficult for people, if you will Ã¢ÂÂ  to push a reboot to the computer and reassess. Ã¢ÂÂ * * * From Rita RedbergÃ¢ÂÂs perspective, there is one easy way to reduce the expanding pool of watchful waiters: stop searching for medical ills so fiercely in the first place. She now wishes that she hadnÃ¢ÂÂt dug so far, literally, into her own thyroid. After the lump was detected during medical school, a radioactive iodine scan determined that it was a Ã¢ÂÂhotÃ¢ÂÂ nodule Ã¢ÂÂ  one that produces excess thyroid hormone  Ã¢ÂÂ  but likely benign. Redberg did little more to check it out for some two decades, other than periodic blood tests, until her primary care doctor worried that it might be growing. She agreed to a needle biopsy, which she now regrets. Her surgery in 2000 left Redberg with a scar on her neck. Each day, she takes a thyroid replacement pill. Strangely enough, Brendan Stack has a similar story. He was teaching medical residents about ultrasound technology and they were practicing on his neck when they found a thyroid nodule. It was biopsied twice, but cancer still couldnÃ¢ÂÂt be completely ruled out. Watchful waiting was one possibility. Ã¢ÂÂI couldnÃ¢ÂÂt tolerate that,Ã¢ÂÂ Stack recalls. Ã¢ÂÂI said, Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre taking it out. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ In 2006, he had surgery to remove the half of his thyroid where the nodule was located. The pathology showed no signs of cancer. Even so, he has no regrets: Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂd do the same thing today. Ã¢ÂÂ And Redberg? SheÃ¢ÂÂs not quite so unequivocal, given how slowly thyroid cancer typically grows. Ã¢ÂÂProbably, on balance,Ã¢ÂÂ she says, Ã¢ÂÂI would have been happier not to have known about it.

2101,"   A couple years ago, Sibel Blau, an oncologist outside of Seattle, was working with the company Guardant Health to test their novel Ã¢ÂÂliquid biopsiesÃ¢ÂÂ in patients. The idea behind liquid biopsies is both elegant and promising. A doctor takes a blood sample from a patient, and then Guardant looks for tumor DNA floating in the blood, allowing doctors to identify the tumorÃ¢ÂÂs unique mutations and offer a personalized drug regimen Ã¢ÂÂ  all without an invasive tissue biopsy. Blau was excited to be on board. When that study wrapped up, Blau still had Guardant test kits left over, so she offered some to her patients at no cost to them. At this point, Blau was routinely ordering DNA sequencing of traditional tissue biopsies, so some patients got both tests. The tissue DNA test from Foundation Medicine was Ã¢ÂÂroutineÃ¢ÂÂ in her practice, but even that test had only become available in 2012. The field of cancer DNA has been changing fast. But BlauÃ¢ÂÂs patients who got both tests didnÃ¢ÂÂt get more clarity Ã¢ÂÂ  if anything, they often got more confusion. The two tests would pick up on different mutations in the same person. So the Foundation   test might suggest two drugs targeted toward the mutations in the patientÃ¢ÂÂs tumor, and the Guardant liquid biopsy a third based on different mutations in the same tumor. In a small study published today in JAMA Oncology, Blau and her colleagues found no overlap between the drugs the tests recommended in five out of eight patients. The new study is very small, but it aligns with other recent work comparing tissue and   sequencing results. A paper from Northwestern researchers in August looking at these same two tests, for example, found that more than half of the mutations identified by one test did not show up in the other. Another study looking at a few especially important mutations (for many kinds of cancers) found the tests agreed 70. 3 percent or 88. 1 percent or  93. 1 percent of the time, depending on the mutation. So which test do you believe? Ã¢ÂÂThere is no easy answer,Ã¢ÂÂ says Richard Schilsky, the chief medical officer of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Ã¢ÂÂBecause nobody actually knows what is the truth in terms of whatÃ¢ÂÂs happening inside a personÃ¢ÂÂs tumor throughout the body. Ã¢ÂÂ Tissue and liquid biopsies are two ways to look inside a tumor, and both views are incomplete in different ways. ASCO is currently developing guidelines for doctors on this exact topic. A tissue biopsy is exactly what it sounds like: The doctor sticks a large needle into the tumor and physically removes a small chunk. Liquid biopsies are little more complicated. Dying tumor cells shed DNA fragments into the bloodstream. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs very little of this circulating tumor DNA in the blood, but recent advances in DNA sequencing have made it much easier to find. A major reason the two kinds of tests return different results is that even a tumor contains multitudes. One chunk may have cells with mutation A,  while another chunk has cells with mutation B. ItÃ¢ÂÂs the luck of the needle draw. Liquid biopsies, on the other hand, can pick up DNA shed by all cancer cells Ã¢ÂÂ  maybe even a nascent tumor in a different location Ã¢ÂÂ  but not all cancer cells shed as much DNA. Ã¢ÂÂWith a tumor biopsy, itÃ¢ÂÂs like you read the book cover to cover. With a liquid biopsy, you read an entire shelf of books, but you only read the dust jackets,Ã¢ÂÂ says Justin Odegaard, the senior medical director of Guardant Health. Guardant thinks that the two kinds of tests are complementary. They tell you different things and the more you know the better. (Foundation Medicine declined to comment on the study.) And indeed, a cancer patient might very reasonably want to take both tests. But GuardantÃ¢ÂÂs and FoundationÃ¢ÂÂs tests both cost $5, 800, and most insurance policies, including Medicare, do not cover them for most types of cancer. In some cases, the advantage of liquid biopsies might be obvious Ã¢ÂÂ  when the tumor is close to a major blood vessel or when blood cancer has spread to multiple sites. In many cases, though, the choice will not be clear.  Medicine tends to have a bias toward the known quantity, and tissue biopsies are the current standard. Blau, for instance, thinks liquid biopsies Ã¢ÂÂare not really ready for primetime. Ã¢ÂÂ When given conflicting information from the two tests, she tells her patients to prioritize the tissue biopsy results.   There is definitely an incentive to make liquid biopsies ready for prime time. The tests could be very lucrative. Since theyÃ¢ÂÂre so   patients could get several liquid biopsies for weeks, months, or even years as their cancer progresses Ã¢ÂÂ  compared to the one initial tissue biopsy. That would allow doctors to look out for new mutations in the cancer and adjust drug regimens as needed. Many companies are now in this space. Foundation has since come out with its own   test, FoundationACT. (ItÃ¢ÂÂs also embroiled in a patent lawsuit with Guardant Health.) Grail, a spinoff from the DNA sequencing machine maker Illumina, is reportedly looking to raise an   $1. 7 billion to test its own   product. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂBut for liquid biopsies to really enter primetime, insurance companies will have to start paying for them.

2102," The first time finding a cure for cancer ever showed up on the presidential radar was in the early 1970s, when President Nixon signed the National Cancer Act. The bill, passed in 1971, provided more funding to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to identify new treatments and diagnostic tools, and Ã¢ÂÂadvance the national effort against cancer. Ã¢ÂÂ Every administration has made the Ã¢ÂÂwar on cancerÃ¢ÂÂ a national mandate, but how close are we in winning that war? And as we stand in 2016, many scientists who deal with all forms of the disease would say that weÃ¢ÂÂre winning the war for sure, but the bigger question is: Would we ever stop fighting? And the answer is no. Ã¢ÂÂLetÃ¢ÂÂs make America the country that cures cancer once and for all,Ã¢ÂÂ President Obama declared Tuesday night during his last State of the Union Address. His remark, a statement uttered by many a political leader since Nixon, is certainly a pretty sound bite, but to achieve it, we have a great deal of work to do. Now, I am hopeful about AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs war on cancer, and some of the countryÃ¢ÂÂs leading experts on this disease agree.  Anna Barker, previously the deputy director of the NCI, told me during a Fox News special in 2010, Ã¢ÂÂWinning the War on Cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ that Ã¢ÂÂat this juncture, I see more promise to really advance against this disease than IÃ¢ÂÂve seen in the last 35 or so years. Ã¢ÂÂ Another topic discussed was the promise of personalized treatment and immunotherapy Ã¢ÂÂ   two approaches that continue to be integral in the progression of the war on cancer today. Ã¢ÂÂI see this as one of the more exciting new developments in the treatment of cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ Steven Rosenberg, who is still the chief of surgery and a research scientist at the NCI, told me in 2010. Looking back, weÃ¢ÂÂve definitely come a long way in screening and diagnosing cancers early, and clearly coming up with a multitude of different technologies that we hope will one day eradicate the development of tumors all together. But we still donÃ¢ÂÂt know for sure what causes cells to mutate, then divide and spread Ã¢ÂÂ   some scientists think itÃ¢ÂÂs bad luck, while others say itÃ¢ÂÂs due to choices we make every day. There are also many kinds of cancer that are difficult to diagnose until theyÃ¢ÂÂre   Ã¢ÂÂ   and by then, are more challenging to treat Ã¢ÂÂ   from pancreatic cancer, to ovarian cancer and lung cancer. And there still remains a lot to be learned about the genetics of the human body as they relate to cancer development, in a world population faced with compromising lifestyle factors and environmental factors that are seriously out of control. Air pollution, smoking, dirty water and poor housing Ã¢ÂÂ   you name it Ã¢ÂÂ   all of these factors can affect our disease risk, and measures to improve those factors must be propelled if we want to reduce the incidence of cancer among Americans. On Tuesday, President Obama said that, with regards to finding a cure for cancer, he wants to accomplish in five years what would normally take a decade to achieve. Many political leaders have spouted off similar wishes, and IÃ¢ÂÂm sure they have all meant it. But saying that we can Ã¢ÂÂcureÃ¢ÂÂ all forms of cancer at any stage of its development is an overstatement at present. Now, America has the best scientists in the world. ItÃ¢ÂÂs filled with brave men and women who are  working around the clock every day to find effective treatments, early diagnostic tools and therapies to keep cancer at bay, and provide those people who are afflicted with the disease with effective treatments that could let them live a long, healthy life. With all those things in our favor, I remain optimistic about the Ã¢ÂÂwar on cancerÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ   and our nationÃ¢ÂÂs ability to fight it Ã¢ÂÂ   but thereÃ¢ÂÂs still much progress that needs to be made.

2104," An Arizona motherÃ¢ÂÂs keen eye detected something might be amiss while studying photos she had taken of her infant son. Andrea Temarantz started seeing a glint in her son RyderÃ¢ÂÂs left eye caused by the flash of her cellphone, NY Daily News reported. Ã¢ÂÂI kind of chalked it up to my cellphone just being a crummy phone,Ã¢ÂÂ Temarantz told the Daily News. Ã¢ÂÂIt very well could have gotten so much bigger. Ã¢ÂÂ The glint that Temarantz, 36, was actually seeing was caused by a rare cancer called retinoblastoma. Doctors confirmed RyderÃ¢ÂÂs diagnosis at his     and gave his parents two options: they could either remove his eye, or give him intravenous chemotherapy that may expose him to a greater risk of developing another cancer, the newspaper reported. The family would later learn of a third option for Ryder, who also has Down syndrome. He could travel to New YorkÃ¢ÂÂs Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for an   chemotherapy session, which targets the affected blood vessel behind the eye through a    catheter entering through his groin. Patients undergo one session per month over a three month span, according to the report. Ryder is scheduled to undergo his second treatment in early February. Dr. David Abramson, chief of ophthalmic oncology service at Memorial Sloan Kettering, told the Daily News that the process cures 99 percent of patients, and children can keep their affected eye. Abramson said he has treated 1, 600 children using this method. Ã¢ÂÂAlmost all of these children were scheduled to have those eyes removed somewhere,Ã¢ÂÂ Abramson told the Daily News. Ã¢ÂÂWe donÃ¢ÂÂt have one child who has died from this cancer. Ã¢ÂÂ The family has been updating followers through a blog called Ã¢ÂÂRyderÃ¢ÂÂs Retinoblastoma Battle #PrayerForRyder,Ã¢ÂÂ and hopes that their story can serve as a lesson for other parents.

2105," As country singer Joey Feek, 40, continues her battle with cervical cancer, for which she stopped receiving treatment in 2015, her husband and singing partner Rory Feek updated fans Monday that his wife has been Ã¢ÂÂasleep for days now, and her body is shutting down quickly. Ã¢ÂÂ Feek was diagnosed with cancer in May 2014 and underwent a radical hysterectomy to treat it that summer, The Tennessean reported. In June 2015, the disease returned as stage 4 cervical cancer, according to RoryÃ¢ÂÂs blog. Joey underwent surgery and aggressive treatment, but they werenÃ¢ÂÂt able to halt its spread. In October, she announced she would be stopping treatment, and, at the time, noted doctors gave her six to nine months to live. She entered hospice care in November. Cervical cancer is relatively rare, but each year about 12, 000 women in the U. S. are diagnosed with the disease and about 4, 000 women die from it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The cancer begins on the surface of the cervix, the lower part of the uterus. In the past 30 years, the number of cervical cancer cases and corresponding rates of death have decreased significantly Ã¢ÂÂ   by more than 50 percent Ã¢ÂÂ   which the CDC and American Cancer Society attribute to many women getting regular Pap tests, which can find cervical precancer before it turns to cancer. Women with early cervical cancers and   usually do not have symptoms, according to the American Cancer Society. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not until the cancer becomes invasive and grows into nearby tissue that symptoms begin. The most common symptoms of the disease are abnormal vaginal bleeding, unusual discharge, and pain during intercourse. Gardasil, the vaccine that helps protect against certain human papillomavirus (HPV) types, can also prevent cervical cancer, as the virus has been linked to the disease. HPV types 16 and 18 cause the majority of cervical cancers. CDC data suggests HPV infections among American teenage girls has dropped by more than 60 percent since the vaccine was introduced in 2006. Stage 4 cervical cancer is the most advanced stage, and indicates the cancer has spread to nearby organs or other parts of the body. It has a 15 to 16 percent   survival rate. Joey and Rory married on June 15, 2002. Rory began his blog, This Life I Live, in January 2014, when his wife was still pregnant with their daughter and she had not been diagnosed with cancer. Their daughter, Indiana, was born in February 2014 and has Down syndrome. The family also includes RoryÃ¢ÂÂs two daughters from a previous marriage. In a post published Monday, Rory expressed that he was grateful for the prospect that his familyÃ¢ÂÂs story may encourage others. Ã¢ÂÂThat is a good thing,Ã¢ÂÂ he wrote.

John Marshall, who went to his grave believing his cancer was caused by standing over burn pits where the military disposed of everything from disabled IEDs to lithium batteries, died at his home in Surprise, Ariz. March 29. He was 31, and left behind a wife and two young children. Ã¢ÂÂJohn was the type of guy who touched people even if he didnÃ¢ÂÂt know them that long,Ã¢ÂÂ said MarshallÃ¢ÂÂs wife and fellow veteran, Ashley. Ã¢ÂÂThe amount of people that have come from all over to offer condolences has been amazing and overwhelming.

He claimed the VA ruled his illness was not related to his service, and Marshall said he was unable to appeal the ruling with evidence because he was laid up in a hospital bed in January 2015 with pneumonia.  Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs all just a big slap in the face,Ã¢ÂÂ Marshall told FoxNews. com. Ã¢ÂÂI tried to be the perfect soldier.

2108,"    I write this from the hospital. Seems I have lung cancer. My doctors tell me my growth was caught early and IÃ¢ÂÂll be fine. Soon I will barely notice that a fifth of my lung is gone. I believe them. After all, IÃ¢ÂÂm at New   Hospital. U. S. News  World Report ranked it No. 1 in New York. I get excellent medical care here. But as a consumer reporter, I have to say, the hospitalÃ¢ÂÂs customer service stinks. Doctors keep me waiting for hours, and no one bothers to call or email to say, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm running late.Ã¢ÂÂ Few doctors give out their email address. Patients canÃ¢ÂÂt communicate using modern technology. I get   EKG tests, echocardiograms, blood tests. Are all needed? I doubt it. But no one discusses that with me or mentions the cost. Why would they? The patient rarely pays directly. Government or insurance companies pay. I fill out long medical history forms by hand and, in the next office, do it again. Same wording: name, address, insurance, etc. I shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be surprised that hospitals are lousy at customer service. The Detroit Medical Center once bragged that it was one of AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs first hospitals to track medication with barcodes. Good! But wait    ordinary supermarkets did that  decades before. Customer service is sclerotic because hospitals are largely socialist bureaucracies. Instead of answering to consumers, which forces businesses to be nimble, hospitals report to government, lawyers and insurance companies. Whenever thereÃ¢ÂÂs a mistake, politicians impose new rules: the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act paperwork, patient rights regulations, new layers of bureaucracy. .. Nurses must follow state regulations that stipulate things like, Ã¢ÂÂNotwithstanding subparagraph (i) of paragraph (a) of this subdivision, a nurse practitioner, certified under section   hundred ten of this article and practicing for more than three thousand six hundred hours may comply with this paragraph in lieu of complying with the requirements of paragraph (a). ..Ã¢ÂÂ Try running a business with rules like that. Adding to that is a fear of lawsuits. Nervous hospital lawyers pretend mistakes can be prevented with paper and procedure. Stressed hospital workers ignore common sense and follow rigid rules. In the intensive care unit, night after night, machines beep, but often no one responds. Nurses say things like Ã¢ÂÂold machines,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂbad batteries,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂwe know itÃ¢ÂÂs not an emergency.Ã¢ÂÂ Bureaucrats donÃ¢ÂÂt care if you sleep. No one sues because he canÃ¢ÂÂt sleep. Some of my nurses were great    concerned about my comfort and stress    but other hospital workers were indifferent. When the customer doesnÃ¢ÂÂt pay, customer service rarely matters. The hospital does have Ã¢ÂÂpatient representativesÃ¢ÂÂ who tells me about Ã¢ÂÂpatient rights.Ã¢ÂÂ But it feels unnatural, like grafting wings onto a pig. IÃ¢ÂÂm as happy as the next guy to have government or my insurance company pay, but the result is that thereÃ¢ÂÂs practically no free market. Markets work when buyer and seller deal directly with each other. That doesnÃ¢ÂÂt happen in hospitals. You may ask, Ã¢ÂÂHow could it? Patients donÃ¢ÂÂt know which treatments are needed or which seller is best. Medicine is too complex for consumers to negotiate.Ã¢ÂÂ But cars, computers and airplane flights are complex, too, and the market still incentivizes sellers to discount and compete on service. It happens in medicine, too, when you get plastic surgery or Lasik surgery. Those doctors give patients their personal email addresses and cell phone numbers. They compete to please patients. WhatÃ¢ÂÂs different about those specialties? The patient pays the bill. Leftists say the solution to such problems is government health care. But did they not notice what happened at Veterans Affairs? Bureaucrats let veterans die, waiting for care. When the scandal was exposed, they didnÃ¢ÂÂt stop. USA Today reports that the abuse continues. Sometimes the VAÃ¢ÂÂs suicide hotline goes to voicemail. Patients will have a better experience only when more of us spend our own money for care.

2109," Eating nuts has been linked to a number of health benefits, such as a reduced risk of obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Now, new findings from South Korea suggest that a   diet may also reduce a personÃ¢ÂÂs risk of colon cancer. The researchers found a reduction in this risk for both men and women, according to the findings, presented here today (April 18) at the American Association for Cancer ResearchÃ¢ÂÂs annual meeting. Eating a serving of nuts three or more times a week appeared to have a big effect on risk, said Dr. Aesun Shin, an associate professor of preventive medicine at Seoul National University College of Medicine in South Korea and an author of the study. In the study, a serving of nuts was considered to be 15 grams (0. 5 ounces) Shin told Live Science. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a smaller amount than whatÃ¢ÂÂs considered a serving in the United States, she added. (A serving in the U. S. is 28 g, or 1 oz.) Although the researchers included many types of nuts in their analysis, peanuts were the most widely consumed nuts among people in the study. This may be due to the availability of peanuts in South Korea, the researchers said. [6 Foods That Are Good For Your Brain] To examine the relationship between eating nuts and colon cancer risk, the researchers looked at 923 patients who had been diagnosed with colon cancer and compared their diets with those of 1, 846 people who did not have colon cancer. The researchers found that men who reported eating three or more servings of nuts a week had a 69 percent lower risk of colon cancer than those who reported eating no nuts. Women who ate three or more servings had an 81 percent lower risk than those who ate no nuts, according to the study. In addition, the researchers looked at several different types of colon cancer, based on the location in the colon where the cancer is found. Nut consumption was associated with a reduced risk across all of the different locations that the researchers examined, Shin said. The study does not prove a    relationship between eating nuts and having a lower risk of colon cancer, the researchers said. However, the researchers hypothesized that some of the compounds, including fiber and antioxidants, found in nuts may help reduce a personÃ¢ÂÂs risk of colon cancer. [Top 10   Foods] Shin noted that a limitation of the study is that participants were asked to recall their own nut intake, and itÃ¢ÂÂs possible that they may have made mistakes.

2110,"   SquibbÃ¢ÂÂs cancer immunotherapy drug, Opdivo, helped advanced head and neck cancer patients with a dismal prognosis live longer than other standard treatments, according to data from a   study presented on Tuesday.  Opdivo treatment led to a 30 percent reduction in risk of death, with median overall survival of 7. 5 months in the   trial, compared with 5. 1 months for those who received any of three commonly used treatments chosen by researchers.  While a median survival difference of less than three months may not sound like much, some patients taking that type of immunotherapy experience far more durable responses.  After one year, 36 percent of Opdivo patients were still alive compared with 16. 6 percent of those who received either methotrexate, docetaxel or Eli LillyÃ¢ÂÂs Erbitux, researchers reported.  The data likely paves the way for another approval for Opdivo, which is currently approved to treat advanced melanoma,   cell lung cancer and kidney cancer.  Ã¢ÂÂThe most important thing is the difference in the proportion of patients who survived to a year,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Maura Gillison, the studyÃ¢ÂÂs lead investigator who presented the data at the American Association of Cancer Research meeting in New Orleans, said in an interview. Ã¢ÂÂIn a disease that was uniformly rapidly fatal, weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing a subset of the population clearly benefiting.Ã¢ÂÂ  Patients in the study had advanced cancer that had progressed within six months of receiving   chemotherapy.  Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs a very devastating cancer when it recurs,Ã¢ÂÂ said Gillison, noting an average survival of less than six months.  Earlier at the meeting, researchers presented data showing 34 percent of patients who received Opdivo for advanced melanoma, the deadliest of skin cancers, were still alive after five years.  Opdivo proved effective whether the head and neck cancer was positive or negative for human papillomavirus (HPV) researchers said. But the magnitude of benefit was greater for   patients, with median overall survival of 9. 1 months versus 4. 4 months for the standard treatments.  Ã¢ÂÂWhatÃ¢ÂÂs got the field so excited is this tumor where weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing a survival benefit is like the worst of the worst actors,Ã¢ÂÂ Gillison said.  Merck  CoÃ¢ÂÂs rival drug, Keytruda, received a priority review for head and neck cancer from U. S. regulators and could be approved for that use by August.  Both drugs belong to a class called   inhibitors that block a mechanism that tumors use to avoid detection from the immune system.

2111," Imagine if there were cells of terrorists inside the United States that had the ability to strike without warning, kill mothers and children, drive families into bankruptcy, cripple productivity, and put the populace in a constant state of fear. Controlling and eradicating these terrorist cells would be all the presidential candidates would be discussing. But what about if instead of terrorist cells, those cells were inside of our bodies in the form of cancers? When President Nixon signed the National Cancer Act in 1971, the fed increased its funding for cancer research. That infrastructure has essentially remained unchanged, with subsequent presidents merely adding to or decreasing the amount of government funding allocated for this study. But no president has taken the time or interest to determine whether the funding policies, approval processes, rules, and regulations that govern the   war against cancer meet AmericansÃ¢ÂÂ current needs. We are fighting the cancer war with strategies that were implemented in 1971, and we have not used the knowledge we have gained to adjust or reform our strategies, resulting in significant wasted resources and inefficiencies. Much of our recent progress in cancer research has been made despite government intervention instead of because of government efforts. We are at an exciting time in the fight against cancer. Developments underway would add at least 2 significant tools to the toolbox we use to approach cancers: early cancer detection in the form of blood tests and immunotherapies, which have the potential to destroy cancer cells, while leaving healthy cells and tissue intact. These new technologies have the potential to be transformative, meaning that eventually they could lessen our reliance Ã¢ÂÂ   or in some instances even replace Ã¢ÂÂ   the hallmarks of cancer treatment used over the past 50 years: surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. One thing scientists have learned over the past 45 years is the earlier that cancer is diagnosed, the better an individualÃ¢ÂÂs chances are for survival. Among cancers diagnosed early Ã¢ÂÂ   at stage 1 or stage 2 Ã¢ÂÂ   the   survival rate is generally between 90 percent and 100 percent. But for cancers diagnosed later Ã¢ÂÂ   at stage 3 or stage 4 Ã¢ÂÂ   the   survival rate is typically between 20 percent and 30 percent. Despite these overwhelming statistics,   government funding is invested in developing   technologies.   companies have recognized the potential of   technologies for cancer and have stepped in to fill the void. The objective of Cancer4Pres. org is to make cancer a priority for the next U. S. president. Over the course of the next   presidential term, 2. 4 million people Ã¢ÂÂ   1, 644 people each day Ã¢ÂÂ   will die from cancer related illnesses, 7 million additional people will be diagnosed with cancer, and the government will spend over $500 billion on cancer care. A thorough review of the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs role in the fight against cancers is certainly worthy of the presidentÃ¢ÂÂs attention, and is long overdue. One way to make cancer a priority for our next president is to make cancer a campaign issue. The way to make cancer a campaign issue is to show the candidates that cancer is important to voters, which is the immediate goal of Cancer4Pres. org. Our hope is that when one candidate recognizes the opportunity to attract voters with a comprehensive policy to address the ongoing national cancer healthcare crisis, the other candidates will follow.

2112," WASHINGTON (AP)    Vice President Joe Biden unveiled a public database for clinical data on cancer on Monday that aims to help researchers and doctors better tailor new treatments to individuals. Overseen by the National Cancer Institute, the Genomic Data Commons starts with genomic and clinical data for 12, 000 patients. The system is designed to increase sharing of information about the gene sequences of tumors and how patients with those tumors responded to specific treatments, Biden, speaking at the American Society of Clinical OncologyÃ¢ÂÂs annual meeting in Chicago, said recent advances in DNA sequencing technology had allowed researchers to generate vast amounts of new data in a short period of time. But he said the cancer world Ã¢ÂÂcan do much better than weÃ¢ÂÂre doing. Ã¢ÂÂThe information is scattered among different government and academic repositories. Most of it is out of the reach of scientists,Ã¢ÂÂ Biden said. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre bringing it into one space.Ã¢ÂÂ The database has emerged as the most tangible component of BidenÃ¢ÂÂs cancer Ã¢ÂÂmoonshot,Ã¢ÂÂ a push in his final year in office to double the pace of cancer research toward a cure. Although the Obama administration has sought an influx of federal funds to accelerate research, Congress has approved only a fraction of whatÃ¢ÂÂs been requested. Since taking on the cancer issue last year, Biden has repeatedly argued that confining data within institutions has hampered cancer research, with scientists and medical companies reluctant to share proprietary information. In fact, cancer research institutions have significant   arrangements in place, although Biden and other critics say itÃ¢ÂÂs too limited and not happening early enough in the process. Though easily searchable, the database includes protections for privacy and security, Biden said. He urged cancer experts gathered in Chicago to Ã¢ÂÂupload your raw genomic dataÃ¢ÂÂ to the system for use by fellow researchers. Ã¢ÂÂAll of you know itÃ¢ÂÂs the right thing to do,Ã¢ÂÂ Biden said. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs the quickest way for us to move forward. And itÃ¢ÂÂs not technically hard for us to do it.Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,Biden unveiling public database for clinical data on cancer,2112.0,2112.0,112.0,

The innovative program, getting under way at NYU LangoneÃ¢ÂÂs Perlmutter Cancer Center in New York City, will design customized diets for patients after assessing their particular reasons for not eating enough, such as nausea, difficulty swallowing or depression. Patients will receive prepared meals at home from a nonprofit group called GodÃ¢ÂÂs Love We Deliver. A randomized controlled trial will assess whether patients benefit from the program. Cancer patients traditionally get dietary advice, but it may provide little help in overcoming eating difficulties. The NYU program aims to offer patients more concrete solutions. Ã¢ÂÂWe are not simply throwing food at them,Ã¢ÂÂ says Erin Jennings, an oncology dietitian and a   on the study. Ã¢ÂÂWe are providing a nutritional Ã¢ÂÂinterventionÃ¢ÂÂ for them.

2120," Silicon Valley startups are racing to develop a blood test for cancer that many scientists believe is years, if not decades, away. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a   competition, fueled by hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital. The winner could help millions of patients fight off cancer before the disease shows any outward symptoms  Ã¢ÂÂ   early enough to drastically improve their odds of survival. Or at least thatÃ¢ÂÂs what these companies envision on their websites and pitch decks, and at scientific meetings  Ã¢ÂÂ   and investors are buying it. Founded in 2014, Freenome raised $65 million last month from Andreessen Horowitz, Peter ThielÃ¢ÂÂs Founders Fund, and AlphabetÃ¢ÂÂs venture arm GV. One of FreenomeÃ¢ÂÂs most prominent rivals, Grail, which spun out of the   monolith Illumina in 2016, has raised an   $1 billion from the likes of Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos. Another competitor, Guardant Health, has amassed close to $200 million. So far, however, these companies have shared scant few details about how, exactly, theyÃ¢ÂÂre creating a test that could fundamentally change how we deal with cancer. FreenomeÃ¢ÂÂs CEO and cofounder, Gabriel Otte, told Fast Company in April 2016 that its test would hit the market within nine months, after being published in a scientific journal. In June, he wrote a blog post claiming that those results would appear Ã¢ÂÂvery soon. Ã¢ÂÂ That hasnÃ¢ÂÂt happened. Otte told BuzzFeed News his staff is still setting up clinical trials and will publish results Ã¢ÂÂwhen weÃ¢ÂÂre ready to publish. Ã¢ÂÂ (Otte recently admitted to BuzzFeed News that he does not have a PhD, despite multiple references to the contrary in the press, company materials, and scientific conferences.) Grail and Guardant have not published any findings, either, although their executives also say they intend to. Academic cancer researchers, meanwhile, say producing this kind of test is an incredibly difficult scientific and logistical challenge. Nascent tumors sometimes shed telltale markers in the blood, but often donÃ¢ÂÂt, and these Ã¢ÂÂbiomarkersÃ¢ÂÂ can be different from one person to another, or even in one person from one month to the next. Plus, credible data will take at least several more years to accumulate in rigorous clinical trials, if not longer. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs not going to be a Star Trek, Ã¢ÂÂletÃ¢ÂÂs take a quick sample and tell you exactly what disease you have and how to treat it,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Jeremy Jones, an assistant professor of cancer biology at the City of Hope in Los Angeles, told BuzzFeed News. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no question that such a test would be revolutionary. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no question that such a test would be revolutionary, giving its inventors enormous social and financial rewards. Ã¢ÂÂEarly detection is incredibly attractive, because if you can detect cancers early, you can cure them at a much higher frequency,Ã¢ÂÂ Tony Blau, a hematologist who directs the Center for Cancer Innovation at the University of Washington, told BuzzFeed News. Just as investors in Theranos, the $9 billion startup now fighting for its life after very public regulatory missteps, envisioned a world where doctors could test for all kinds of conditions from a few drops of blood, Silicon Valley is embracing the vision of cancer screening for everyone, early and often. Blood tests for   cancer would be drastically better than current diagnostic methods like Ã¢ÂÂtissue biopsies,Ã¢ÂÂ in which doctors extract potentially cancerous tissue with needles and surgeries. Tests on a couple teaspoons of blood could be much less expensive and invasive, and performed more often. A highly accurate test would also have an advantage over todayÃ¢ÂÂs   tests. Mammograms, for instance, have high rates of both false negatives (they miss one in five breast cancers) and false positives (which happen to about half of women who get the test annually over a decade). Scientists have long known that cancer cells routinely shed bits of DNA into the bloodstream. But in the past few years, thanks to advances in DNA sequencing, these bits have become far easier to detect. There are already a handful of tests, led by Guardant, that use these DNA bits to detect cancer in a cancer patientÃ¢ÂÂs blood, or to identify certain mutations that might be treatable with personalized therapies. But so far, there is no reliably accurate commercial test that can do this for people who are early in the disease and have not yet been diagnosed  Ã¢ÂÂ   the lofty goal of Freenome and its competitors. The DNA shed by   tumors accounts for less than   of a percent of all DNA in a patientÃ¢ÂÂs blood, said Ash Alizadeh, a Stanford University oncologist who helped develop and sell a technology to potentially help doctors monitor how a tumor responds to therapy. For some tumors, such as those that start in the brain, their DNA is virtually undetectable even in tens of milliliters of blood, he added. Ã¢ÂÂThe computations are so low,Ã¢ÂÂ Alizadeh said. Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs been a major challenge for early detection. Ã¢ÂÂ Even if a test was able to detect every single molecule of DNA in a blood sample, that wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be enough. Machines often generate   readings of clumps of cells that are deceptively   such as moles that donÃ¢ÂÂt turn into melanoma or colorectal polyps that donÃ¢ÂÂt become colon cancer, Alizadeh says. Ã¢ÂÂDo we know that those changes are always going to lead to a cancer that could threaten a patientÃ¢ÂÂs life?Ã¢ÂÂ said Blau of the University of Washington. Ã¢ÂÂThe answer to that is no, we donÃ¢ÂÂt know that. Ã¢ÂÂ Yet another hurdle is simply knowing what DNA sequences to look for, since, as Blau points out, cancer cells differ within the same patient, and even within the same tumor. And even if a test appears to work in a lab, proving it works in people will take years. Ã¢ÂÂYou have to test thousands of patients, wait long enough that enough of them get cancer and enough of them ultimately die of the disease, to be able to really evaluate if a new test is a useful screening test,Ã¢ÂÂ Max Diehn, an assistant professor of radiation oncology at Stanford, told BuzzFeed News. (He also consults for Roche, which owns the technology he   with Alizadeh.) One of GrailÃ¢ÂÂs first steps is a   clinical trial in the United States with at least 7, 000 patients with untreated cancer, and 3, 000   people. It began in August 2016 and plans to wrap up by August 2022. Scientists hope to understand the molecular differences in the two groupsÃ¢ÂÂ blood samples, as well as how they change as disease develops. Grail has an advantage in its ties to Illumina, the worldÃ¢ÂÂs dominant supplier of   machines, which expects Grail to become Ã¢ÂÂone of IlluminaÃ¢ÂÂs largest customers over time. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂOur hope is over time that weÃ¢ÂÂll be marching the population back earlier and earlier to where almost everyone who has cancer is diagnosed early,Ã¢ÂÂ Grail Chief Business Officer Ken Drazan told BuzzFeed News. Guardant, on the other hand, believes that the knowledge it has already gleaned from testing 35, 000 cancer samples can help pinpoint how the disease arises. President AmirAli Talasaz says that in addition to studying tumor DNA fragments, the company is looking at other kinds of chemical changes in tumors, called Ã¢ÂÂepigenomicÃ¢ÂÂ variations. Guardant is running clinical trials of various sizes, including on   patients and cancer survivors a spokeswoman said there is no estimated date of completion. Meanwhile, Freenome is testing its technology on patient blood samples from UC San Francisco, UC San Diego, Massachusetts General Hospital, and other clinics. For some samples, Freenome tries to predict if the patients received a cancer diagnosis or not. Other samples are from patients who are still being tracked for cancer but havenÃ¢ÂÂt yet been diagnosed. In total, Freenome plans to test Ã¢ÂÂthousandsÃ¢ÂÂ of samples, though Otte declined to say how many have been tested to date. He still contends that these data will be published in a scientific journal before tests are sold commercially. The CEO reportedly hooked FreenomeÃ¢ÂÂs main investor, Andreessen Horowitz, after acing a blinded test of five blood samples provided by the venture capital firm (which also invests in BuzzFeed). As Otte wrote last year, the company correctly categorized two of the samples as normal, and the other three as cancerous  Ã¢ÂÂ   and even accurately labeled what stage of disease. Although two of the cancer samples were from patients in late stages, he wrote, the third was stage one, a sign that the test could detect early cancer in a   person. At a conference in San Francisco in February, Otte shared some striking numbers with an audience of scientists. Freenome had an accuracy rate of more than 95% in detecting the presence or absence of prostate cancer in 351 samples, according to an abstract of the presentation that Otte subsequently confirmed was real. Supposing that FreenomeÃ¢ÂÂs test is as sensitive and specific as the rate claimed, Ã¢ÂÂthat would be a surprising result,Ã¢ÂÂ Diehn, of Stanford, said. Alizadeh said there doesnÃ¢ÂÂt seem to be enough information about the studies to know what to make of the technologyÃ¢ÂÂs apparently high performance. Ã¢ÂÂFor any test, especially a clinical one,Ã¢ÂÂ he said by email, Ã¢ÂÂinterpreting accuracy requires knowing the error rate. Ã¢ÂÂ In DiehnÃ¢ÂÂs view, too, there isnÃ¢ÂÂt enough information to evaluate FreenomeÃ¢ÂÂs claims. Ã¢ÂÂWhen you have a surprising result, the onus is on the scientists to provide evidence  Ã¢ÂÂ   strong evidence, supportive evidence  Ã¢ÂÂ   for such a claim. Ã¢ÂÂ During his presentation, Otte also said Freenome had a 97% average accuracy rate in detecting breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers across four stages of progression, including stage one. The sample size wasnÃ¢ÂÂt disclosed. Ã¢ÂÂIf theyÃ¢ÂÂre trying to say they can tell what stage a patient has, based on a blood test, I would find that would be very surprising,Ã¢ÂÂ Diehn said. A stage is defined by how far a tumor has spread from where it started, which usually requires imaging and pathological tests, according to Diehn. Sometimes, he said, the only difference between a   and   tumor is being slightly bigger, or spreading to a single lymph node. According to Jones, who attended the presentation, Otte said that Freenome could tell when a case of prostate cancer was aggressive or  . There are Ã¢ÂÂearly indicationsÃ¢ÂÂ that the technology can do this, Otte told BuzzFeed News, but it is still in development. Otte acknowledged that all of these results need to be validated in larger clinical trials. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre focused on making sure that we get the numbers we need to prove to the world that our tests are safe and function well. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂWhat theyÃ¢ÂÂre saying could be theyÃ¢ÂÂve developed a great test, or they donÃ¢ÂÂt really have the data, and theyÃ¢ÂÂre trying to make it sound like they have. Ã¢ÂÂ OtteÃ¢ÂÂs talk left Jones impressed, he said, but wondering, Ã¢ÂÂHow do we know itÃ¢ÂÂs real?Ã¢ÂÂ He understands why Freenome wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt want to reveal its technologyÃ¢ÂÂs   to competitors before the test is on the market. But that choice, he said, Ã¢ÂÂmakes it difficult in academic science to know how valid it is. Ã¢ÂÂ Diehn put it more bluntly: Ã¢ÂÂWhat theyÃ¢ÂÂre saying could be theyÃ¢ÂÂve developed a great test, or they donÃ¢ÂÂt really have the data, and theyÃ¢ÂÂre trying to make it sound like they have. Ã¢ÂÂ FreenomeÃ¢ÂÂs test picks up not only tumor DNA fragments, Otte said, but DNA changes that signal Ã¢ÂÂhow the immune system is responding to the presence or absence of the tumor. Ã¢ÂÂ FreenomeÃ¢ÂÂs   platform deduced that a    link between these unspecified immunological signatures and cancer, Otte said. It makes sense that the immune system would respond to an abnormal growth early on, Jones says. But Ã¢ÂÂthe immune system obviously responds to things other than cancer all the time,Ã¢ÂÂ he added. Ã¢ÂÂWhat if a patient is on antibiotics, what if they have an active viral or bacterial infection? Does that cloud the ability to detect the cancer pattern?Ã¢ÂÂ Unlike Guardant and Grail, Freenome does not have a clinical or scientific advisory board. The company is in the process of building them, Otte wrote last month. Vijay Pande, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz and a Freenome board member, said the company is rightfully broadening its analysis beyond just tumor DNA. Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂs a whole landscape, in principle, of whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on in your body available in blood,Ã¢ÂÂ he told BuzzFeed News. There arenÃ¢ÂÂt existing papers that describe the basis of FreenomeÃ¢ÂÂs approach, Pande acknowledged  Ã¢ÂÂ   but thatÃ¢ÂÂs because its computational methods are so advanced, theyÃ¢ÂÂre effectively creating new knowledge. Ã¢ÂÂThis is new territory,Ã¢ÂÂ said the former Stanford computational biologist. Ã¢ÂÂThis could not be done 20 years ago. Ã¢ÂÂ Whether it can be done today remains to be seen.

2122,"Ã¢ÂÂThis week in the British Medical Journal, a group of experts argue patients are being misled by claims that cancer screening Ã¢ÂÂsaves livesÃ¢ÂÂ.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ They say screening should be measured against the total number of deaths, rather than just deaths from one specific type of cancer.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Screening means testing healthy people for early signs of cancer.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ But thereÃ¢ÂÂs a difference between Ã¢ÂÂsaving livesÃ¢ÂÂ and lowering rates of cancer.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Most trials measure how screening changes the death rate from the cancer being screened for.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Screening often reduces the death rate from a specific cancer.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ But when you look at overall deaths, they can remain the same.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Screening doesnÃ¢ÂÂt help us deal with all kinds of cancer.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Screening can lead to overdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ So what should be done about it? Ã¢ÂÂ] Saying that screening Ã¢ÂÂsave livesÃ¢ÂÂ is misleading, Prasad told BuzzFeed News, because dying in general Ã¢ÂÂhas not been proven to be lowerÃ¢ÂÂ. Epidemiologst Gilbert Welch, who was not involved in the analysis but whose work was cited, told BuzzFeed News that he agrees with the authors.  In his book Less Medicine, More Health (Beacon Press, 2015) Welch writes:  Screening is often promoted as Ã¢ÂÂsaving lives. Ã¢ÂÂ I bet when most people hear that language they think it means that screening helps people live longer. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what most of my patients think Ã¢ÂÂ  and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what I would have thought before I started to study cancer screening. In 2013, 30 years after the initial screening, the studyÃ¢ÂÂs researchers published a  . They found that in the screened group, 2% of people had died from colon cancer. In the unscreened group, 3% had (as is illustrated in the graph below). So the screening worked, right? Screening might Ã¢ÂÂsave livesÃ¢ÂÂ from one disease, but not Ã¢ÂÂsave livesÃ¢ÂÂ overall. The turtles arenÃ¢ÂÂt going anywhere. They are the indolent, nonlethal cancers. The rabbits are ready to hop out at any time. They are the potentially lethal cancers, cancers that might be stopped by early treatment. Then there are the birds. Quite simply: they are already gone. They are the most aggressive cancers, the ones that have already spread by the time they are detectable, the ones that are beyond cure.  Screening can only help with the rabbits. The turtles donÃ¢ÂÂt need help the birds canÃ¢ÂÂt be helped. This is how some types of cancer can counterintuitively end up causing more damage if they are caught early on. It is the turtles  Ã¢ÂÂ   cancers that were never really going anywhere in the first place  Ã¢ÂÂ   that cause the problem of overdiagnosis. In their BMJ analysis, Prasad and his   use the example of PSA, a test for prostate cancer. They say PSA tests lead to lots of false positives, which contribute to 1 million people undergoing prostate biopsies every year. This can have bad consequences: Prostate biopsies are associated with serious harms, including admission to hospital and death. Moreover, men diagnosed with prostate cancer are more likely to have a heart attack or commit suicide in the year after diagnosis or to die of complications of treatment for cancers that may never have caused symptoms. But in the meantime, Prasad and his colleagues say the risks of screening need to be better communicated to patients to help them make up their own minds. Ã¢ÂÂScreening is a discussion,Ã¢ÂÂ he told BuzzFeed News. Ã¢ÂÂIt is not a box to check off at a certain age.

The family requests that their privacy be respected at the moment more details will be provided at a later time. AngÃÂ©lil, who guided DionÃ¢ÂÂs career as her manager, is survived by the coupleÃ¢ÂÂs three children, including    twins. He is also survived by two adult children from a previous relationship. The following year, Dion began to receive gold medals and world recognition for her singing. AngÃÂ©lil continued to manage her career, and in 1994 the couple married. In interviews, Dion said their relationship was based on Ã¢ÂÂtrue love. Ã¢ÂÂ The couple celebrated their 21st wedding anniversary last month.  In 1999, AngÃÂ©lil was diagnosed with throat cancer, but, after aggressive treatment, was declared cancer free in 2000, when the couple renewed their vows in a lavish celebration. But in 2013, Dion and AngÃÂ©lil learned the cancer had returned.  In a recent appearance on Good Morning America, Dion also revealed that AngÃÂ©lil had to be fed through a feeding tube, telling host Deborah Roberts, Ã¢ÂÂWe are taking life one day at a time, [but] we are choosing to live.

McCaskill, a    Democrat, said in a statement posted to her Tumblr account that she plans to take three weeks off to get treatment in St. Louis. This is the full statement: I will be in St Louis for the next 3 weeks receiving treatment. During this time my staff will continue to assist Missourians and I will be posting on my Senate website (McCaskill. senate. gov) how I would have voted on any matters that come before the Senate during my absence  Ã¢ÂÂ   which IÃ¢ÂÂll also enter into the Congressional record. Additionally, IÃ¢ÂÂll be submitting questions in writing for any missed Senate hearings. Thank you for the honor of serving you in the Senate. McCaskill, who is the first woman to represent Missouri in the U. S. Senate, recently made headlines by live tweeting parts of her jury duty. She was chosen to decide a civil case regarding a man who fell in side a convenience store. Generally viewed as one of the more moderate Democratic senators, McCaskill has recently been a vocal member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in its battle with Backpage. com, which is being accused of enabling sex trafficking. The committee recently voted to hold the online advertising company in contempt of Congress over its refusal to hand over documents on how it screens clients.

2125," In 1989, a New Yorker writer named Paul Brodeur published a story about Meadow Street in Guilford, Connecticut, where cancer cases had clustered near power lines and an electric substation. His influential book, called The Great Power Line Cover Up, followed in 1993. It was a sequel, of sorts, to stories Brodeur had written in the 1970s linking microwave ovens, TV broadcasts, and CB radios to potentially lethal doses of radiation. Ã¢ÂÂAfter reading Ã¢ÂÂThe Great   Ã¢ÂÂ the only thing I am convinced of is that author Paul Brodeur truly believes that electromagnetic waves from   cause cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ a reviewer wrote in the Los Angeles Times in 1993. These days, we donÃ¢ÂÂt hear much about microwaves, or power lines, or CB radios causing cancer, because now we have new gadgets to worry about: our cell phones. On Thursday, a preliminary cell phone radiation study in rats, posted online by the very respectable National Toxicology Program, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has once again raised the question of whether invisible radiation is giving us all cancer. The study found low rates  Ã¢ÂÂ   in the 2% to 3% range  Ã¢ÂÂ   of brain and heart tumors in 90 male rats dosed with nine hours a day of cell phone exposure for two years, starting in the womb. The rats exposed to cell phone signals also lived longer than others, which is kind of weird if the radiation is so deadly. And it didnÃ¢ÂÂt affect female rats. Despite the slew of headlines the study spurred, cancer researchers say one rat study doesnÃ¢ÂÂt erase a patchy history of claims of a link between electric fields and cancer. Plus, there just isnÃ¢ÂÂt any human data, and no increase in brain or heart tumors in people that should show up with hundreds of millions of them using cells phone, if there really was a link. Ã¢ÂÂThere is a really long history here of studies like this one, where the immediate response of people in the field is that Ã¢ÂÂthis must be wrongÃ¢ÂÂ we would have seen it long ago if it was true. Which is infuriating,Ã¢ÂÂ cancer epidemiologist Richard Stevens of the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the study, told BuzzFeed News. Ã¢ÂÂOn the other side, we have had a long history of scares, where many times, they are junk science. Ã¢ÂÂ A 1992 study linking power lines to cancer, for example, turned out to be a case of scientific misconduct, where a researcher from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory fabricated data to suggest cells altered their chemistry in response to electromagnetic fields. The new NTP study isnÃ¢ÂÂt junk science, which is why it has gotten some notice, after it was first reported by Microwave News (dedicated to Ã¢ÂÂreporting on the potential health and environmental impacts of electromagnetic fields and radiationÃ¢ÂÂ for 35 years). The experiment was requested by the Food and Drug Administration after a 2011 World Health Organization classification of cell phone signals as a Ã¢ÂÂpossible carcinogenÃ¢ÂÂ and conducted by   federal scientists. Ã¢ÂÂThis report from the National Toxicology Program is good science,Ã¢ÂÂ Otis Brawley of the American Cancer Society said in a statement on the study that called it a Ã¢ÂÂparadigm shiftÃ¢ÂÂ in cell phone risk thinking. Ã¢ÂÂThis is a striking example of why serious study is so important in evaluating cancer risk. Ã¢ÂÂ On the other hand, Ã¢ÂÂa lot of these basic science studies just donÃ¢ÂÂt work out and are never replicated,Ã¢ÂÂ Nicole Willmarth of the American Brain Tumor Association. Ã¢ÂÂPeople should take studies like this one with a grain of salt. Ã¢ÂÂ The rat study is just part of a bigger effort scheduled for completion next year, which also includes mice. One NIH reviewer of the paper, Michael Lauer, suggested that the results were likely false, simply based on the low number of rats involved in the study. The curious finding that male rats in the control group unexposed to cell phone signals died sooner, and that past studies havenÃ¢ÂÂt seen such an effect, Ã¢ÂÂleaves me even more skeptical of the authorsÃ¢ÂÂ claims,Ã¢ÂÂ Lauer wrote. Ã¢ÂÂWe do not know why the male rat control group had a low survival rate,Ã¢ÂÂ the NTP research team acknowledged in their report. But they stood by their statistics, suggesting there is only a 5% chance it is a fluke. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs standard in medical studies, but it makes a lot of statisticians nervous, especially after a 2005 Stanford study titled Ã¢ÂÂWhy Most Published Research Findings Are FalseÃ¢ÂÂ raised the profile of unreliable statistics in biomedicine. The dose of cellphone radiation  Ã¢ÂÂ   not enough to warm the rats, but close  Ã¢ÂÂ   and its duration starting in the womb, make it very hard to extrapolate from the findings to the average person whose cell phone spends most of its time plugged into the dashboard of their car, Willmarth said. Ã¢ÂÂWhatÃ¢ÂÂs remarkable is they are finding any effect at all. Ã¢ÂÂ About 240 million Americans own cell phones, while only 150 million owned one in 2000. And over that same time period, brain cancer rates have remained flat or declined slightly, according to National Cancer Institute data, at about 6 cases in every 100, 000 people. Ã¢ÂÂYou might argue that brain tumor rates are not increasing and more people are using cell phones, but you could also say people donÃ¢ÂÂt hold cell phones to their heads so much anymore, they are reading or sending text messages on them,Ã¢ÂÂ said Willmarth. Most researchers just see the new NIH study as science at work, slow and steady. But the original radiation alarmist Brodeur, now 85, sees a conspiracy. Ã¢ÂÂThese findings are nothing short of a bombshell,Ã¢ÂÂ he told BuzzFeed News by email, saying they will force NCI and NIH to weigh in after Ã¢ÂÂignoring or denying the existence of this problem for more than two decades.

2127," Craig Sager, the NBA sideline reporter famous for his colorful suits, died Thursday after having cancer for years. He was 65. Ã¢ÂÂCraig Sager was a beloved member of the Turner family for more than three decades and he has been a true inspiration to all of us,Ã¢ÂÂ Turner Broadcasting President David Levy said in a statement. Sager, a longtime face on TNT, stood out on the sidelines with his flashy suits. Ã¢ÂÂWhile he will be remembered fondly for his colorful attire and the TNT sideline interviews he conducted with NBA coaches and players, itÃ¢ÂÂs the determination, grace and will to live he displayed during his battle with cancer that will be his lasting impact,Ã¢ÂÂ Levy continued. Ã¢ÂÂOur thoughts and prayers are with CraigÃ¢ÂÂs wife, Stacy, and the entire Sager family during this difficult time. We will forever be Sager Strong. Ã¢ÂÂ In addition to his wife, Sager is survived by his five children. Sager had been open about his 2014 diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia, and in 2015 he took time off for treatment. When he returned to the air in December 2015, Gregg Popovich, the notoriously difficult coach of the San Antonio Spurs, offered a touching welcome back. Ã¢ÂÂI can honestly tell you this is the first time IÃ¢ÂÂve enjoyed doing this ridiculous interview weÃ¢ÂÂre required to do,Ã¢ÂÂ Popovich said. Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs because youÃ¢ÂÂre here and youÃ¢ÂÂre back with us. Ã¢ÂÂ NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Sager was widely respected for his insightful reporting, as well as the courage he showed in the face of his illness. Ã¢ÂÂCraig Sager was as vital to the NBA as the players and coaches,Ã¢ÂÂ Silver said in a statement. Ã¢ÂÂA true original and an essential voice on Turner SportsÃ¢ÂÂ NBA coverage for 26 seasons, Craig chronicled some of the most memorable moments in league history and was a ubiquitous presence with his splashy suits and equally colorful personality. Ã¢ÂÂ In July, Sager was honored with the Jimmy V Award for Perseverance at the ESPYs. He reflected on his life in sports, and the effect being diagnosed with a terminal disease had on him. Ã¢ÂÂI will never give up, and I will never give in,Ã¢ÂÂ Sager said. Ã¢ÂÂI will continue to keep fighting, sucking the marrow out of life as life sucks the marrow out of me. I will live my life full of love and full of fun. ItÃ¢ÂÂs the only way I know how. Ã¢ÂÂ Vice President Joe Biden, who has led a federal push for cancer research, presented Sager with the award.

2128,"Ã¢ÂÂMy check didnÃ¢ÂÂt come. Ã¢ÂÂ 	Eviction court is not the saddest place in the world, but if you were taking a Dantean descent through the underworld of underclass despair and dysfunction, it would be somewhere around the fourth or fifth circle. Because my Virgil on this journey is an actual attorney, with a suit and tie and everything, the judge has moved us to the end of the docket on the theory that there might be arguments in our case, that this litigation might turn into something resembling litigation. There are not going to be any arguments, but we get to sit through a few hoursÃ¢ÂÂ worth of very sad stories. I think the lawyer enjoys this even less than I do, even though he gets paid by the hour. 	The teacher in me cannot help but notice that when it comes time to explain the facts of the case, the people in this courtroom rarely appear as the subjects in their own sentences. A Ã¢ÂÂdomestic eventÃ¢ÂÂ just Ã¢ÂÂhappened,Ã¢ÂÂ and now the man in her life cannot reside under the same roof as her daughter  Ã¢ÂÂ   or Child Protective Services will take that daughter away. Which means that after her eviction (which is never seriously in doubt) she cannot rely on the person upon whom most people in her situation instinctively would rely. 	She is not the only person whose check didnÃ¢ÂÂt come. The passivity and subjectlessness of these narratives is striking, and strikingly consistent. Domestic events happen. Checks come or donÃ¢ÂÂt come. (Mostly they donÃ¢ÂÂt.) Husbands are sent to jail, children are taken away by the   minions of Authority, disease descends. The money isnÃ¢ÂÂt there. And, in the end, they are evicted. Bad things just happen, and, today, I am the bad thing that is just happening to one of these luckless and unhappy children of God. I am eviction, I am CPS, I am the check that didnÃ¢ÂÂt come. I am diabetic amputation. I am cancer. 	Ã¢ÂÂWhy are you doing this to us?Ã¢ÂÂ the womanÃ¢ÂÂs daughter demanded. Because I am the bad thing that is just happening to you today, the unforeseeable event that has been hanging over you by a single hair of a horseÃ¢ÂÂs tail for a decade, the inevitable end of a terrible lamentation. 	But people love their sad stories. They feel compelled to tell them. Local law here is pretty straightforward on the matter of evictions: If you donÃ¢ÂÂt pay your rent (mine is the only case today not involving rent) then you have to go. Ã¢ÂÂDid you pay any rent in February?Ã¢ÂÂ the judge asks two dozen times. Ã¢ÂÂDid you pay any rent in March?Ã¢ÂÂ The judgeÃ¢ÂÂs power in these matters extends only to ordering (or not ordering) an eviction and ordering the payment of unpaid back rent. If a tenant wants to sue the landlord for violating the lease, or if the landlord wants to sue the tenant for failing to pay an electricity bill or damaging the property, that is a separate action. But even though the judge repeatedly explains that the sins of the landlords are irrelevant at this moment to the immediate legal question before his court, the tale must be told: He didnÃ¢ÂÂt return phone calls or text messages. There were repairs left unmade. There were bedbugs. Tenants put scarce and desperately needed money into making unlivable rental properties just barely livable. 	Ã¢ÂÂDid you pay any rent in April?Ã¢ÂÂ 	It is different in other places that have laws making it more difficult to evict   tenants. One Californian whose family owns a number of residential rentals reports that he routinely pays people cash to vacate properties rather than endure the trouble, expense, and uncertainty of eviction proceedings. I had had the same thought myself, but it quickly became clear that eviction would be the more economical route. They very much wanted to stay in the house, though not enough to offer to rent it or buy it. But certainly enough to sit tight and hope that the situation would somehow just resolve itself in their favor. 	The woman I am evicting does not show up in court. (About half of those evicted decline to attend the proceedings today.) Her son attends on her behalf. My lawyer asks me five or six    questions. The judge asks the son if he has a response. Ã¢ÂÂNo. Ã¢ÂÂ He asks if he would like to present an argument. Ã¢ÂÂNo. Ã¢ÂÂ 	And that was that. 	Of course, thatÃ¢ÂÂs never really that. Many people who have been evicted simply refuse to leave after being ordered to, which means that they will in the end be visited by constables who remove them and their belongings from the property, often to a chorus of wailing and lamentation. And another bad thing just happens to people who, for whatever reason, have no sense of agency in their own lives. 	Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂll give you a break on my rate,Ã¢ÂÂ says my lawyer, looking at his watch. He is the son of   farm laborers, who learned at least one thing from his hard and poor childhood: DonÃ¢ÂÂt be a farm laborer. Law looked like a pretty good alternative, and it seems to be working out pretty well for him. The idiomatic English would be, Ã¢ÂÂHe became a lawyer. Ã¢ÂÂ The better English would be, Ã¢ÂÂHe made himself a lawyer. Ã¢ÂÂ How did that happen? It must have begun with decisions he made as a child or as a very young man: A leads to B leads to C leads to a good income and a nice house and a bass boat. 	A few months ago, I recounted the story of Preston Smith, a man from a very poor background (think outhouses and bare feet) who walked across a wide stretch of Texas to attend college at the beginning of a career that would see him become (make himself) a successful businessman and, later, governor of Texas. He and a friend made a living in college by opening up what at the time would have been called a Ã¢ÂÂfilling station,Ã¢ÂÂ a gas   store. By the time he was out of school, he had a few of them, and a movie theater, too. The reaction to that column surprised me: Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs great,Ã¢ÂÂ critics wrote, Ã¢ÂÂbut he lived at a time when someone in his circumstances could open a gas station without backing and financing, and without all the taxes and regulation we have now. Ã¢ÂÂ As though the Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi immigrants who operate convenience stores from coast to coast show up in the United States with a $1 million line of business credit from Chase, an MBA, and a gas station waiting for them in Oklahoma. Next time youÃ¢ÂÂre filling up in some country location late at night, take a peek around the back of the place, and see how many of those immigrants are quietly living in the gas stations they operate. It is not uncommon, for a time. But they donÃ¢ÂÂt stay there long. 	And while I am not much of a   on these kinds of questions (we have a positive moral obligation to help the poor, and not just the Ã¢ÂÂdeservingÃ¢ÂÂ poor) I cannot help but think of those hustling immigrants when I encounter the   sons and daughters of this sweet land of liberty who, if it were raining jobs and opportunity, would find a way to walk between the raindrops. 	Ã¢ÂÂMy check didnÃ¢ÂÂt come. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂDid you pay any rent in January?Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThe factory closed down. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThe textile jobs moved to Thailand and Vietnam.

2129,"So, Joe Biden is going to cure cancer. That was among President ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs big ideas in his final State of the Union pageant. LetÃ¢ÂÂs start with the obvious: Joe Biden is not going to cure cancer. Joe Biden couldnÃ¢ÂÂt find chlamydia backstage at a MÃÂ¶tley CrÃÂ¼e concert. (ItÃ¢ÂÂs easy to picture Joe Biden backstage at a MÃÂ¶tley CrÃÂ¼e concert, isnÃ¢ÂÂt it?) He couldnÃ¢ÂÂt find NaCl in an aqueous solution if he fell into the Pacific Ocean. Joe Biden is about as likely to discover a cure for cancer as J. J. Watt is to sing the lead in The Marriage of Figaro and dance in La Sonnambula with the Bolshoi in between    Super Bowl wins. AinÃ¢ÂÂt gonna happen. In fact, it is isnÃ¢ÂÂt very likely that anybody is going to cure cancer  Ã¢ÂÂ   ever. There are some reasons for that, none of which seems to have occurred to Barack Obama. To begin with, thereÃ¢ÂÂs the inconvenient fact that there is no such thing as cancer. Ã¢ÂÂCancerÃ¢ÂÂ refers to a category of diseases, one that contains hundreds of different maladies. Some of those have a great deal in common with one another, many do not.   breast cancer really isnÃ¢ÂÂt very much at all like HodgkinÃ¢ÂÂs lymphoma the former presents a very difficult course of treatment with a poor outlook, while the latter is so effectively treated (90 percent survival rate) that it is sometimes described as Ã¢ÂÂcurable,Ã¢ÂÂ though physicians tend to shy away from the use of that word. Cancer is one of natureÃ¢ÂÂs great survivors, an eternal (so far) reminder that you can give your heart to Jesus but your ass belongs to evolution. As   surgeon David Gorski puts it, Ã¢ÂÂCancer progression can be viewed as being due to a case of evolution in which the tumor cells that survive selection to continue to grow are the ones that become best at doing all the things that tumor cells need to do to evade the bodyÃ¢ÂÂs defenses and overcome its   signals. Ã¢ÂÂ Cancer is unlikely to be Ã¢ÂÂcuredÃ¢ÂÂ for the same reason that crime will never be eradicated: adaptation. At the same time, it would not be at all surprising if, in a generation or two, dying from cancer were as rare and exotic as being crippled by polio is today. There is a great deal of promising research in any number of fields, from genetics to nanobiology, that should instill in us a cautious and sober optimism that we can make more cancers treatable and manageable, that in a few decades having cancer could be more like having diabetes. But that is a very different thing from finding a cure. This is an example of political thinking. The political mind imagines that if political will is bent toward some particular end, and that if the right people with the right philosophy are empowered to command sufficient resources, then all of reality is malleable. That isnÃ¢ÂÂt how the world actually works if it were, there would never be a recession or other economic shocks, intractable   problems related to distant primitive desert savages, or, for that matter, traffic jams. But these things exist, because the world that exists in the political imagination is not the real world. President Obama might have made a different sort of declaration: Ã¢ÂÂWe are going to spend some additional money to fund a number of different   projects, and we hope that at least some of those projects will yield results that enable us to develop, at some point in the future, marginally more effective treatments for some kinds of cancer. Ã¢ÂÂ But that isnÃ¢ÂÂt what President Obama said. It isnÃ¢ÂÂt what President Richard Nixon said, either. In 1971, the federal government  Ã¢ÂÂ   stupid phrase  Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂdeclared war on cancer. Ã¢ÂÂ President Nixon, with some fanfare, signed into law the National Cancer Act, which increased support to the National Cancer Institute. Ã¢ÂÂAs a result of signing this bill,Ã¢ÂÂ President Nixon said, Ã¢ÂÂthe Congress is totally committed to provide the funds that are necessary, whatever is necessary, for the conquest of cancer. The president is totally committed. . . . You will have, of course, the total commitment of government, and that is what the signing of this bill now does. Ã¢ÂÂ Everyone was committed  Ã¢ÂÂ   and cancer didnÃ¢ÂÂt care, because cancer doesnÃ¢ÂÂt follow politics. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre going to cure cancerÃ¢ÂÂ isnÃ¢ÂÂt a   agenda  Ã¢ÂÂ   itÃ¢ÂÂs a political promise. Government funding of basic scientific research at its   stages is one of the most fruitful (or, if you prefer, least destructive) things that government does. Sometimes that research is in the service of an explicit federal priority (usually military) and sometimes it is more general. Ensuring that the money is well spent without putting research decisions in the hands of lawyers is sometimes a tricky business, one that the researchers themselves often enough complicate by following their own political agendas. Our management practices here probably should tend toward the regular and the general, rather than directing resources into moonshot projects that sound more plausible on television than in the laboratory.  Joe Biden isnÃ¢ÂÂt going to cure cancer. LetÃ¢ÂÂs make sure that he and the imperial hubris he brings with him donÃ¢ÂÂt get in the way of our making progress in treating it, and in advancing our understanding of other diseases.,",cancer,"No, Joe Biden IsnÃ¢ÂÂt Going to Cure Cancer",2129.0,2129.0,129.0,
2130,"Last Monday, the White House announced the formation of its Cancer Moonshot Task Force, a   to President ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs State of the Union exhortation to Ã¢ÂÂmake America the country that cures cancer once and for all. Ã¢ÂÂ At the time, the presidentÃ¢ÂÂs announcement elicited snickers from many on the right concerned about expansive government programs that promise more than they can deliver. But conservatives who worry about the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs role in combating cancer are missing a key part of the picture: When it comes to making big gains against cancer, itÃ¢ÂÂs not about central planners generating solutions from whole cloth itÃ¢ÂÂs about making sure nothing gets in the way of the   treatments that are already within our reach. Conservatives can play an important part in the cancer moonshot by helping to keep it focused on its key task. Cancer cells cloak themselves from the bodyÃ¢ÂÂs immune system. We can now strip that cloak away with drugs called Ã¢ÂÂcheckpoint inhibitors. Ã¢ÂÂ We can also genetically modify   T cells and send them, like predator drones, to attack tumors. Based on research showing that genetic screening could detect   cancer in pregnant women, Illumina just launched a company called Grail to develop and commercialize a test to detect circulating tumor DNA, potentially identifying   patients before they show any clinical symptoms. The earlier we can detect cancer, the more easily we can cure it. But enormous challenges still loom. We desperately need a new Ã¢ÂÂgold standardÃ¢ÂÂ for testing promising cancer medicines  Ã¢ÂÂ   a system that uses the latest advances in artificial intelligence, statistics, and powerful diagnostic platforms to rapidly identify and test promising combinations of drugs in the patients who are most likely to respond.  Another key challenge is to get researchers, companies, and academic medical centers to embrace robust data sharing. Universities use prominent journal articles as a yardstick for tenure, salary, and promotion  Ã¢ÂÂ   encouraging researchers to hoard, not distribute, data. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs also a complex web of privacy regulations at the state and federal levels that discourages data sharing, or provides a   excuse for avoiding it. As a result, everyone pays data sharing lip service, but very few institutions have committed to the kind of massive, routine data sharing that we need to make rapid strides against cancer. Vice President Joe Biden  Ã¢ÂÂ   tasked by President Obama to lead the moonshot efforts  Ã¢ÂÂ   is already making a difference through the call to arms he has issued from the bully pulpit. Share article on FacebookshareTweet A large coalition of pharma and biotech companies, along with academic cancer centers and community oncologists, have agreed to test more than 60 medicines in different immunotherapy combinations, attacking up to 20 tumor types in   trials through the National Immunotherapy Coalition. They call the program Cancer Moonshot 2020.  The NIC aims to use the latest diagnostics tests, including   genomic and proteomic sequencing, to match 20, 000 cancer patients with combination immunotherapies that match their particular disease profiles. The goal is to achieve Ã¢ÂÂdurable,   remission for patients with cancer. Ã¢ÂÂ ItÃ¢ÂÂs the largest immunotherapy trial network of its kind. This is the first time that a major private insurer has agreed to cover   sequencing for cancer patients. (The insurer is Independence Blue Cross.) If this effort is successful, the NIC will help rewrite the rules for rapidly developing and testing novel combination treatments for cancer. BidenÃ¢ÂÂs call for routine data sharing is also shaking up the status quo, drawing long overdue attention to a complex system that claims to protect patient privacy but often operates against the wishes of cancer patients, who are overwhelmingly eager to share their data. Government is well positioned to tackle this problem, because it regulates   research and pays for much of the underlying research and patient care (through Medicare). In short, the opportunity is certainly there to make big strides against cancer quickly. Conservatives should take BidenÃ¢ÂÂs promise to Ã¢ÂÂclear the wayÃ¢ÂÂ of regulatory hurdles for scientists and researchers at face value, and help him find the right walls to knock down. Critics have correctly noted that the engineering problem implied by the Ã¢ÂÂMoonshotÃ¢ÂÂ phrase is wrong. Cancer research isnÃ¢ÂÂt rocket science itÃ¢ÂÂs orders of magnitude more complicated. But theyÃ¢ÂÂre nitpicking when they should be engaging. They should join with Biden and call for government to pare back or repeal costly and ineffective regulations that slow research, empower patients to control their own data, and commit federal agencies to moving towards a nimble,   framework for rapid   development.   ItÃ¢ÂÂs easy to become cynical about government when it tries to do too much. But if we fail to engage, we lose the opportunity to articulate a conservative vision for what government can do well: direct public resources more efficiently and effectively, provide the right incentives for unleashing entrepreneurship and innovation, and set a regulatory framework that empowers patients and their physicians to make informed decisions about the risks and benefits of new technologies.  It might take decades, but the battle against cancer is one America can win. Conservatives shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be on the sidelines in that fight.  Ã¢ÂÂ   Paul Howard, Ph. D. is a senior fellow and director of health policy at the Manhattan Institute. ",cancer,Conservatives Can Ã¢ÂÂ and Should Ã¢ÂÂ Play a Role in the Cancer Moonshot,2130.0,2130.0,130.0,
2131,"The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) now faces congressional inquiries, legal challenges, and harsh criticism from the scientific community that are shredding the agencyÃ¢ÂÂs credibility and threatening its future. The Lyon, France Ã¢ÂÂ  based group is an arm of the World Health Organization and has received millions in U. S. tax dollars, funding that is now being questioned by top lawmakers on Capitol Hill including House Oversight Committee chairman Jason Chaffetz. Congress is also investigating whether IARC is colluding with officials at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to advance a political agenda rather than sound science. IARCÃ¢ÂÂs central role is to evaluate certain risk factors and whether they can cause cancer. Each year, an IARC working group produces a report  Ã¢ÂÂ   called a monograph  Ã¢ÂÂ   classifying the level of risk for each agent. Out of the nearly 1, 000 factors IARC has evaluated, only one (caprolactam) was deemed  . That report raised immediate suspicions for being politically motivated glyphosate is a widely used weedkiller now targeted by environmental and   groups around the world because it is used on several genetically engineered crops. The chemical was created by Monsanto, which also sells genetically engineered seeds, and sold under the brand name Roundup. Nearly every other scientific and governmental agency has determined that glyphosate is safe. (After the IARC report in March 2015, a separate WHO agency found that glyphosate is unlikely to cause cancer.) But armed with the imprimatur of a global health agency,   activists brandish the report as proof that glyphosate is unsafe and unhealthy. It wasnÃ¢ÂÂt long before IARCs monograph was widely discredited. Even the head of the European Food Safety Authority denounced the report and the IARC as Ã¢ÂÂthe first sign of the Facebook Age of Science,Ã¢ÂÂ writing, Ã¢ÂÂYou have a scientific assessment, you put it on Facebook, and you count how many people Ã¢ÂÂlikeÃ¢ÂÂ it. Ã¢ÂÂ Questions about a corrupt process also began to emerge the man who pushed for the glyphosate review, Christopher Portier, is an environmental activist and worked part time for the Environmental Defense Fund (he told me he didnÃ¢ÂÂt view this as a conflict and did not see the need to disclose that to the IARC). Another agency seems to be playing political games about glyphosate: the EPA. The agency continues to delay a safety reevaluation on glyphosate despite two recent reports that reaffirm EPAs longstanding position that glyphosate does not cause cancer. Lawmakers suspect that the delay is politically motivated and are demanding answers. In a scathing letter to EPA administrator Gina McCarthy on October 25, House Science, Space, and Technology Committee chairman Lamar Smith accused McCarthy of making Ã¢ÂÂmisleading and untruthful statementsÃ¢ÂÂ to Congress last summer about the glyphosate report as well as about her agencyÃ¢ÂÂs involvement with IARC: Ã¢ÂÂThe increasing amount of evidence depicting the close ties between EPA officials, Christopher Portier, and the IARC study of glyphosate show that there are activists working both inside and outside the agency to derail this process. Ã¢ÂÂ Smith is seeking testimony from three EPA employees tied to the IARC working group. Chaffetz is now asking the National Institutes of Health to explain why U. S. taxpayers continue to fund IARC Ã¢ÂÂdespite this record of controversy, retractions, and inconsistencies. Ã¢ÂÂ Chaffetz accuses IARC of trying to Ã¢ÂÂinfluence American policymaking, even though IARC avoids having to meet the strict scientific standards and government scrutiny afforded to science advisory committees in America. Ã¢ÂÂ But despite the fact that IARC gets U. S. tax money, it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt feel bound by U. S. law. IARC officials counseled its   members to ignore Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests from the Energy and Environment Legal Institute (EE Legal) which is seeking documents related to the glyphosate monograph. IARC   members include scientists from American public universities and EPA employees who are required to comply with FOIA. (A Mississippi State University professor offered his resignation from a subsequent IARC group in response to the groupÃ¢ÂÂs request to avoid FOIA inquiries.) EE Legal blasted the cancer agency: Ã¢ÂÂUnfortunately, by their behavior, every player in this unfolding drama thinks they have a right to hide public records from the public. They do not. Ã¢ÂÂ As if congressional and legal pressures arenÃ¢ÂÂt enough, IARC is on the receiving end of withering criticism from its own ranks. Ten top experts in the fields of toxicology and oncology published a report in a prestigious scientific journal on October 26, writing that IARCÃ¢ÂÂs methods are outdated and cause Ã¢ÂÂunnecessary health scares and unnecessary diversion of public funds. Ã¢ÂÂ The scientists are recommending an international initiative to develop updated methods for carcinogenicity assessments. Ã¢ÂÂIARC has become the byword for activist science, disgracing the reputation of international research agencies and undermining the public trust in   scientific policy advice,Ã¢ÂÂ said David Zaruk, a   professor and blogger who has extensively covered the IARC fiasco. Ã¢ÂÂI strongly urge countries like the U. S to take responsibility for the mess this agency has become, demand a wholesale reorganization, or stop funding it.

The FOX broadcaster, who has become a sideline staple on NFL Sundays,   she was diagnosed in late September following a routine checkup last June. While in a meeting with colleagues ahead of the GiantsÃ¢ÂÂ Week 3 showdown with the Redskins at MetLife, Andrews received a phone call from her doctor confirming it was cancer.

Michael David Barrett went to jail, and Andrews eventually settled with the hotel operator after being awarded $55 million in a civil lawsuit in March. Now this. But Andrews was back in the grind 48 hours after her surgery. Ã¢ÂÂShould I have been standing for a full game five days after surgery?

Speaking at the worldÃ¢ÂÂs largest science conference, Dr. Edze Westra, a senior research fellow at the University of Exeter, says the breakthrough is possible  Known as CRISPR, they let scientists accurately cut out tiny sections of faulty genes and replace them with healthy DNA. Westra said the technology will soon allow medics to screen embryos and replace genes that trigger illness before babies are born. There are more than 4, 000 known   conditions. And they are thought to affect around 1 percent of births worldwide. It means doctors can one day use   to prevent these inherited conditions being passed on to future generations. Westra said it could also be used to prevent cancer by removing rogue genes.  which multiplies a personÃ¢ÂÂs chance of breast cancer. WestraÃ¢ÂÂs comments come just days after two major US scientific institutions backed the technology. The National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine  First introduced in 2012, CRISPR is already rapidly transforming research. Asked where we will be in 20 years, Westra said scientists may have cured all inherited diseases. Speaking at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) annual meeting in Boston, Westra he said   is causing a Ã¢ÂÂtrue revolutionÃ¢ÂÂ in science and medicine. He said: Ã¢ÂÂA mutation in a gene that causes disease can now be repaired using CRISPR. Ã¢ÂÂIn the coming decades, CRISPR will become   and I think we will see it being used to cure genetic diseases and cancers. Ã¢ÂÂ Scientists could also use the technology to fight off epidemics, such as malaria  Ã¢ÂÂ   and even cure cancer. They hope to one day Ã¢ÂÂcut and pasteÃ¢ÂÂ genes into cells that produce antibodies against such diseases. Westra said: Ã¢ÂÂThis is going further than just genetic editing and essentially placing the CRISPR machinery inside of cells so that they will always make, for example, an antibody in a mosquito which would prevent malaria infection. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs like turning cells into a factory. Ã¢ÂÂBut we need to do lots of   work to find out what the implications will be. Ã¢ÂÂ Critics warn the technology could be abused to create Ã¢ÂÂdesignerÃ¢ÂÂ babies.

Ã¢ÂÂ But Westra defended the technology. He said: Ã¢ÂÂThe main thing is that I want to inform the public about we aim to do with CRISPR.

Ã¢ÂÂIt was a silly thing,Ã¢ÂÂ said Watts, now 27, of her final plans for Gizelle, her    mastiff. Ã¢ÂÂBut it helped me create memories as opposed to crying about it. Ã¢ÂÂ She details the experience in her memoir, Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ (Simon & Schuster, out Tuesday). But itÃ¢ÂÂs not just a story of death; itÃ¢ÂÂs also about how Gizelle saved WattÃ¢ÂÂs life. Ã¢ÂÂMy heart hurt miserably. [But] I knew that we had the best adventures we possibly could have had.Ã¢ÂÂ The author was 19 and about to start her sophomore year at the University of Tennessee when she got Gizelle as a puppy in 2008. At the time, her mother was struggling with drug and alcohol addiction. Watt writes of her mom having a   seizure at Christmas and being so out of it that she Ã¢ÂÂansweredÃ¢ÂÂ the familyÃ¢ÂÂs Chihuahua instead of a ringing phone. Watt would temporarily flee the chaos of her home with Gizelle, the two of them driving, walking, even running for hours to escape. Ã¢ÂÂNo matter how bad you feel about yourself, [dogs] are always there providing love unconditionally,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂSo I made up my mind to love my mom no matter what. Ã¢ÂÂ When Watt graduated in 2011, the two set out for New York City. While looking at apartments, the author would tell brokers that Gizelle  Ã¢ÂÂ   who weighed about 160 pounds  Ã¢ÂÂ   was Ã¢ÂÂjust over 100 poundsÃ¢ÂÂ so as not to be turned away. The two moved, along with a friend, into a small   apartment in Times Square. Ã¢ÂÂGizelle was so mellow and   so it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt too bad,Ã¢ÂÂ Watt said of the space. Ã¢ÂÂWe were happy. Ã¢ÂÂ The canine soon became a local celebrity after she took part in the Tompkins Square   competition one Halloween, dressed as the Beast from Ã¢ÂÂSandlot. Ã¢ÂÂ But when Gizelle was about 7 years old, she was diagnosed with Ã¢ÂÂaggressiveÃ¢ÂÂ bone cancer. Doctors could amputate GizelleÃ¢ÂÂs back leg and start chemotherapy; the treatment would be painful and, as the cancer had likely already reached her lungs, she would not survive. Or Watt could make the most of her petÃ¢ÂÂs last days. Ã¢ÂÂI was devastated. I didnÃ¢ÂÂt want to lose my best friend,Ã¢ÂÂ Watt said. Ã¢ÂÂIt was a matter of learning to accept the situation and then figuring out [how] to make it   . Ã¢ÂÂ One of the first things that came to mind was the fact theyÃ¢ÂÂd never been to the beach together. In fact, there were a lot of things they hadnÃ¢ÂÂt done yet: eating ice cream, going pumpkin picking. Those things turned into GizelleÃ¢ÂÂs bucket list. Completing the items on the list was bittersweet. Sometimes the days were full of laughter, like when Watt took Gizelle on a canoe in New Hampshire and nearly fell overboard upon the discovery of a spider. One of their best times was a trip to the beach, where Gizelle got to play in the waves, and dog and owner napped together on the sand. On their last night, Watt made steaks. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs how she knew it was the end, she writes: Gizelle barely lifted her head when the steak was ready. Months before, she would have wolfed it down. Ã¢ÂÂMy heart hurt miserably,Ã¢ÂÂ she writes of the day in 2015 she took her best pal for a final ride to the vet. But Ã¢ÂÂI knew that we had the best adventures we possibly could have had.

Ã¢ÂÂ Instead of using baggy clothes to conceal my figure, I wear plunging necklines to accentuate my lithe, svelte shape. On Jan. 10, 2011, doctors discovered a lump in my right breast during a mammogram. I was shocked. I was only 41, had no family history, I ate healthy and never smoked. It was Stage 3 cancer, but the prognosis was good if I followed all the protocols. I immediately started six rounds of chemo over the next four months and scheduled surgery, followed by 28 days of radiation. My breast surgeon made me see a psychiatrist to make sure I was of sound mind, and ensure that I wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt regret having my healthy breast removed, too. I was uncomfortable with the idea of reconstruction from the start. I didnÃ¢ÂÂt want to insert silicone implants under my skin to create the semblance of a breast. And I didnÃ¢ÂÂt want to wear prostheses to even myself out and conform to the standards set by society. Nonetheless, at my doctorÃ¢ÂÂs urging, I saw a plastic surgeon before proceeding. (Patients typically start reconstruction at the same time as cancer removal.) To my dismay, he simply assumed I would have reconstruction. As he described the options and multiple surgeries, none of it sounded right for me. When I got home, I was numb. I had no clear idea how to proceed. I searched the Internet for images of Ã¢ÂÂbilateral mastectomy without reconstruction. Ã¢ÂÂ To my relief, up popped a photo of a young mother, flat and topless, playing with her children on the beach. She gave me hope and courage. I showed my husband, David Romine, 60, an inventory manager in book publishing. Ã¢ÂÂDo it,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, supporting me completely. I made my decision to go breastless two weeks after my diagnosis. Yet, I faced opposition. My breast surgeon made me see a psychiatrist to make sure I was of sound mind, and ensure that I wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt regret having my healthy breast removed, too. I found a second plastic surgeon who understood my decision. Next, my insurance company refused to pay. This was despite the   which requires insurance plans that cover mastectomies to provide reconstruction, including to the other  Ã¢ÂÂ   often unaffected  Ã¢ÂÂ   breast, to produce a symmetrical appearance. The act, however, does not specify what type of reconstruction, and it isnÃ¢ÂÂt clear that Ã¢ÂÂgoing flatÃ¢ÂÂ is a reconstructive choice. So insurers decide what they want. Thankfully, my plastic surgeon wrote off the $20, 000 cost. IÃ¢ÂÂm not sure why, but three times the insurance company denied my claim, and he always reassured me I would not be saddled with the bill. After surgery in June 2011, I was as flat as a child. At first, it was a challenge to accept  Ã¢ÂÂ   it took time and compassion to change my deeply ingrained ideas of female attractiveness. My husband had to come to grips with the changes in my body in his own way, but he loves me with all his heart. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not about my breasts; itÃ¢ÂÂs about what weÃ¢ÂÂve been through together. And we are stronger for it. Many other things changed. I had to get a new wardrobe, because everything I owned was too blousy. Even then, I still had to remove the darts from every blouse I bought. ItÃ¢ÂÂs freeing to run without boobs or a bra and not have straps dig into my shoulders, although sometimes I wear a lacy bra under a sheer top when I want to look more feminine. And I sleep easier on my stomach. I started lifting weights to bolster my confidence. Now, my pec and ab muscles are more defined  Ã¢ÂÂ   David calls me the Ã¢ÂÂBreastless Wonder,Ã¢ÂÂ like itÃ¢ÂÂs my superpower. I had rebuilt myself, inside and out, yet I still felt alone a year later. Where were the other   or   women? I never saw them on the street; the subject was rarely discussed. Fed up, in June 2012, I ranted on an online cancer discussion board. To my surprise, support poured in. More than 4, 000 women who had made similar choices or were considering them responded. Ã¢ÂÂYou are an inspiration,Ã¢ÂÂ one wrote. Ã¢ÂÂI, too, want to see other women who are flat, and I want to be seen. I want to connect and feel connected. Ã¢ÂÂ That summer, I met a beautiful,    woman who had lost a breast to cancer decades ago. We were in a   water exercise class at the  . She noticed how I was flat under my bathing suit. Ã¢ÂÂYou are so brave,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve been trying not to wear this prosthesis for 30 years. I canÃ¢ÂÂt even go to the corner store without it. Ã¢ÂÂ I was aghast. Social inhibitions were holding her prisoner. It was then that I knew I had to become an advocate for women like her and let others know there are choices out there. In February 2014, I posted my first nude photo and an essay about my decision to go flat on my blog. I worried that my followers might reject me  Ã¢ÂÂ   but once again, people were welcoming. I want newly diagnosed women to understand that reconstruction isnÃ¢ÂÂt for everyone. Be a uniboober. Be a flattie. The important thing is to be you. Emboldened, I walked the runway topless for Play Out Underwear, a genderless lingerie company. In September 2015, I joined 12 other breastless survivors who walked topless through the streets of Berlin for   that was submitted to the Berlin International Film Festival, highlighting our diverse beauty and sexuality  . Through it all, IÃ¢ÂÂve learned to love my scars. In them, I see the strength of my conviction. I made choices against my doctors and society, and IÃ¢ÂÂve never regretted it. Cancer taught me that the only person I need to please is me. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not easy to be flat in a world where breasts are an omnipresent marketing tool, selling everything from shampoo to cars. I get stares of curiosity and confusion. I hear ignorant comments about my vaguely gendered body. But there are uplifting moments. One day, a legless drummer in the subway looked at me. His eyes dipped to my chest, and he smiled so deeply, I felt an intense connection. He understood; I had lost a part of my body, too. Lately, IÃ¢ÂÂve noticed a sea change. Flatties are banding together in support, posing topless and changing perceptions of what female bodies look like. I hope the movement will continue to grow until acceptance becomes the norm. I want newly diagnosed women to understand that reconstruction isnÃ¢ÂÂt for everyone. Be a uniboober. Be a flattie. The important thing is to be you.

2141,"The mom of a   teenage boy has revealed she gave her son cannabis Ã¢ÂÂto ease his painÃ¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ   and has made a miraculous recovery. Callie Blackwell and her husband Simon, of Norfolk, decided to give her teen son Deryn the Class B drug after he became addicted to the   drugs he was being given at hospital. In her new book  Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ   Callie tells the story of her then    son being diagnosed with leukemia in 2010 and Langerhans Cell Sarcoma  Ã¢ÂÂ   a rare and aggressive cancer, two years later. Deryn, now 17, has since defied doctors by surviving two deadly cancers. The youngster is dubbed the Ã¢ÂÂboy in seven billionÃ¢ÂÂ because he is thought to be the only person to have had both conditions at the same time. His mum Callie detailed in her book how they made the decision and the Ã¢ÂÂfrighteningÃ¢ÂÂ experience of finding cannabis and administrating it to their son.  Callie said: Ã¢ÂÂDeryn was nauseous and, worse, had become addicted to his   drugs. Ã¢ÂÂWe couldnÃ¢ÂÂt sit by and watch him spend his last days in a morphine fog. Enough was enough. Ã¢ÂÂ She added: Ã¢ÂÂWe took a decision that will horrify many parents reading this  Ã¢ÂÂ   and horrified me, too. Ã¢ÂÂAfter all, IÃ¢ÂÂd never seen anything positive come of smoking cannabis, and in my days working in nightclubs, illegal drugs had been my enemy. Ã¢ÂÂBut if it could help my darling boy escape his daily torment, I was willing to try it.

Her husband Simon then arranged to meet someone at a nearby petrol station to pick the illegal drug  Ã¢ÂÂ   which carries a sentence of up to five yearsÃ¢ÂÂ imprisonment for possession. Based on her online research, Callie was then able to make the Ã¢ÂÂtinctureÃ¢ÂÂ using a rice cooker and glycerine  Ã¢ÂÂ   suitable for the vaporizer pen. She gave it to her son Deryn, who by then, had moved out of hospital and into a hospice. Callie said: Ã¢ÂÂAfter 10 minutes, Deryn said that the pain had decreased a little and he felt more relaxed  Ã¢ÂÂ   the words we had been longing to hear. Ã¢ÂÂ After the cannabis use continued, Callie claims her sonÃ¢ÂÂs finger  Ã¢ÂÂ   which had been black and dead  Ã¢ÂÂ   was beginning to heal after he had Ã¢ÂÂno immune system and no way of fighting of infection. Ã¢ÂÂ She also claims doctors later told her they were Ã¢ÂÂno longer sure DerynÃ¢ÂÂ was dying. Since then Deryn left the hospice and went back to school to take his GCSEs.

2143,"WASHINGTON  Ã¢ÂÂ   It sounds like science fiction, but a   device that makes electric fields to fight cancer improved survival for the first time in more than a decade for people with deadly brain tumors, final results of a large study suggest. Many doctors are skeptical of the therapy, called tumor treating fields, and itÃ¢ÂÂs not a cure. ItÃ¢ÂÂs also    Ã¢ÂÂ   $21, 000 a month. But in the study, more than twice as many patients were alive five years after getting it, plus the usual chemotherapy, than those given just the chemo  Ã¢ÂÂ   13 percent versus 5 percent. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs out of the boxÃ¢ÂÂ in terms of how cancer is usually treated, and many doctors donÃ¢ÂÂt understand it or think it can help, said Dr. Roger Stupp, a brain tumor expert at Northwestern University in Chicago. He led the   study while previously at University Hospital Zurich in Switzerland, and gave results Sunday at an American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Washington. Ã¢ÂÂYou cannot argue with them  Ã¢ÂÂ   theyÃ¢ÂÂre great results,Ã¢ÂÂ and unlikely to be due to a placebo effect, said one independent expert, Dr. Antonio Chiocca, neurosurgery chief at Brigham and WomenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital in Boston. Dr. George Demetri of the   Cancer Institute in Boston and a board member of the association hosting the conference, agreed but called the benefit modest, because most patients still die within five years. Ã¢ÂÂIt is such a horrible diseaseÃ¢ÂÂ that any progress is important, he added. The device, called Optune, is made by Novocure, based in Jersey, an island near England. ItÃ¢ÂÂs sold in the U. S. Germany, Switzerland and Japan for adults with an aggressive cancer called glioblastoma multiforme, and is used with chemo after surgery and radiation to try to keep these tumors from recurring, as most do. Patients cover their shaved scalp with strips of electrodes connected by wires to a small generator kept in a bag. They can wear a hat, go about their usual lives, and are supposed to use the device at least 18 hours a day. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not an electric current or radiation, and they feel only mild heat. It supposedly works by creating low intensity, alternating electric fields that disrupt cell division  Ã¢ÂÂ   confusing the way chromosomes line up  Ã¢ÂÂ   which makes the cells die. Because cancer cells divide often, and normal cells in the adult brain do not, this in theory mostly harms the disease and not the patient. In a 2011 study, the device didnÃ¢ÂÂt improve survival but caused fewer symptoms than chemo did for people whose tumors had worsened or recurred after standard treatments. The U. S. Food and A second study, in newly diagnosed patients, was stopped in 2014 after about half of the 695 participants had been tracked for at least 18 months, because those using the device were living several months longer on average than the rest. The FDA expanded approval but some doctors were leery because the device wasnÃ¢ÂÂt compared with a sham treatment  Ã¢ÂÂ   everyone knew who was getting what. Study leaders say a sham was impractical, because patients feel heat when they get the real thing, and many would refuse to shave their heads every few days and use an inconvenient device for years if the treatment might be fake. Some doctors said they would withhold judgment until there were   results on the whole group. Now theyÃ¢ÂÂre in: Median survival was 21 months for those given Optune plus chemo versus 16 months for those on chemo alone. Survival rates were 43 percent versus 31 percent at two years; 26 percent versus 16 percent at three years, and 13 percent versus 5 percent at five years. Side effects were minimal but included   problems, weakness, fatigue and skin irritation from the electrodes. Ã¢ÂÂThe device is now impossible to ignore   Ã¢ÂÂ¦     it absolutely is an advance,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Andrew Lassman, brain tumor chief at the Columbia University Medical     Hospital. He consults for Novocure, as do some doctors running the study. The latest National Comprehensive Cancer Center guidelines include Optune as an appropriate treatment for brain tumors. ItÃ¢ÂÂs also is being tested for pancreatic, ovarian and lung cancers; electrodes are worn on the belly or chest for those. A big issue is cost  Ã¢ÂÂ   roughly $700 a day. Most U. S. insurers cover it but Medicare does not and Ã¢ÂÂwe are paying,Ã¢ÂÂ said NovocureÃ¢ÂÂs chief executive, Bill Doyle. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂve never refused a patient regardless of insurance status. Ã¢ÂÂ The price reflects Ã¢ÂÂan extremely sophisticated medical device, made in very low quantities,Ã¢ÂÂ with disposable parts changed several times a week and a support person for each patient, he said. Plus 17 years of lab, animal and human testing. That cost? Ã¢ÂÂThe round number is half a billion dollars,Ã¢ÂÂ Doyle said. Joyce EndresenÃ¢ÂÂs insurance covers all but about $1, 000 a year for her device. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs a great plan, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs why I still work,Ã¢ÂÂ said Endresen, 52, employed by a direct mail company in suburban Chicago. She has scans every two months to check for cancer and Ã¢ÂÂtheyÃ¢ÂÂve all been good,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂWe celebrated two years of no tumor in December and went to South Africa. Ã¢ÂÂ Doctors say many patients wonÃ¢ÂÂt try the device because of the trouble involved or because they donÃ¢ÂÂt want a visible reminder of their cancer. Not Endresen.

2150,"Brad Grey, the former head of Paramount Pictures, died on Sunday evening at age 59. His family said in a statement that the cause was cancer and that they were with him when he passed in his Holmby Hills, Calif. home. Grey ran Paramount for 12 years before being forced out in February  Ã¢ÂÂ   collateral damage caused by a bruising power struggle pitted the head of Paramount parent company Viacom with the Redstone family that controls it. Ã¢ÂÂI look forward to new adventures,Ã¢ÂÂ the   studio head wrote in his farewell memo to colleagues. Grey, who looked in good health, kept his illness a secret from almost all of Hollywood. His achievements at Paramount include overseeing the studioÃ¢ÂÂs   film, Ã¢ÂÂTransformers: Dark of the Moon,Ã¢ÂÂ as well as profitable franchises Ã¢ÂÂStar TrekÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂMission Impossible. Ã¢ÂÂ Paramount also produced such acclaimed properties as Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂThe Big Short,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂNo Country for Old Men,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThere Will Be BloodÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂUp in the AirÃ¢ÂÂ on GreyÃ¢ÂÂs watch. The   studio head entered the entertainment business while still a student at the State University of New York at Buffalo, where he became an intern to another Buffalo alum, Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein, who was more a concert promoter than an independent movie maven back then, gave a    Grey just enough experience to produce his first concert  Ã¢ÂÂ   a Buffalo appearance by Frank Sinatra. In 1986, Grey teamed Bernie Brillstein to form   Entertainment, a talent manager that took to packaging programming. Eventually recognized as one of HollywoodÃ¢ÂÂs most successful firms,   produced numerous television hits, including Ã¢ÂÂThe Sopranos,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThe Larry Sanders ShowÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂReal Time with Bill Maher. Ã¢ÂÂ In 1996, Brillstein sold his shares of the company to Grey, who renamed it Ã¢ÂÂBrad Grey Television. Ã¢ÂÂ Grey ventured into film that same year, producing Ã¢ÂÂHappy Gilmore,Ã¢ÂÂ an Adam Sandler vehicle.  In 2001, he   Plan B with Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston but gave up his ownership stake after leaving to run Paramount in 2005.

Recent flops like Ã¢ÂÂZoolander 2Ã¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,Ã¢ÂÂ racked up losses of nearly $450 million last year, setting the stage for GreyÃ¢ÂÂs exit when new management cleaned house at ViacomÃ¢ÂÂs operating divisions.

2151,"A Texas beauty queen has undergone a radical surgery that allowed her to use her ankle as her knee after having her leg amputated. Jesse Williams, 20, of Odem, was a gifted college volleyball player and Miss Teen USA contestant when she learned that she had been diagnosed with a rare type of bone cancer called EwingÃ¢ÂÂs sarcoma. In September 2016, she had been competing in a volleyball tournament when she began to experience knee pain. Ã¢ÂÂMy trainer said he thought it sounded like a torn meniscus. You can technically still play on that as long as you arenÃ¢ÂÂt in too much pain,Ã¢ÂÂ Williams told Barcroft Media. Ã¢ÂÂSo I played all season on it and the plan was to send me to the doctor and look at surgery options at the end of the season. Ã¢ÂÂ But the Texas Lutheran University student couldnÃ¢ÂÂt shake the feeling that there might be something seriously wrong. Ã¢ÂÂI had that feeling of what if, but I was like it cant be,Ã¢ÂÂ Williams said. Ã¢ÂÂI mean IÃ¢ÂÂm 19 years old. IÃ¢ÂÂm playing college volleyball. How could that have happened?Ã¢ÂÂ She met with an orthopedic surgeon who determined that she had a rapidly growing bone cyst and referred her to an oncologist. Ã¢ÂÂSo they did an open biopsy and thatÃ¢ÂÂs when it came back positive for EwingÃ¢ÂÂs sarcoma,Ã¢ÂÂ Williams said. Ã¢ÂÂWhen they told me that it was cancer, I was so shocked, I didnÃ¢ÂÂt really believe it. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs when Williams was faced with a tough decision: simply remove the tumor and keep her leg or undergo a   surgery that would require amputation, but increase her chances of beating the cancer. Ã¢ÂÂI could have just had the tumor taken out and salvaged the limb, but from research I have done and people I have met, there is a higher relapse rate if you go that route and thatÃ¢ÂÂs not what I wanted,Ã¢ÂÂ Williams said. Ã¢ÂÂInstead I opted just to have the leg removed and rotationplasty offered me the best way of life once that decision had been made. Ã¢ÂÂ Since the tumor was in her femur, doctors removed the middle portion of her leg. The procedure then involved rotating the foot, ankle and shin 180 degrees to reattach them to her upper leg. She was given a prosthetic lower leg to walk. Williams has remained positive through the procedure and treatment, but admits that it has been an adjustment. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs kind of been   because I always had long pretty hair. IÃ¢ÂÂve always been the tall, pretty girl. ItÃ¢ÂÂs difficult being bald and  . I say that all the time. A lot of people tend to shy away because theyÃ¢ÂÂre like, Ã¢ÂÂWhy does she look like that? Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Since the surgery, she has kept busy training to return to volleyball and get back on the pageant circuit. Ã¢ÂÂThe thing is I still want to compete again for Miss Texas, so I need to get my body back in shape for where it needs to be for that,Ã¢ÂÂ Williams said. Williams said wants to show other amputees that they can still pursue dreams  Ã¢ÂÂ   such as becoming the first amputee Mist Texas and representing the national volleyball team in the Paralympic Games. Ã¢ÂÂMy motto of life is Ã¢ÂÂI want to make a difference by being different,Ã¢ÂÂ and I feel like thatÃ¢ÂÂs what IÃ¢ÂÂm doing with rotationplasty, with cancer, with anything I do in life,Ã¢ÂÂ she said.",cancer,Cancer-stricken beauty queen gets knee replaced withÃÂ ankle,2151.0,2151.0,151.0,

The method is still in its early stages, but researchers were able to edit out the protein that causes cell division and proliferation in isolated cervical and kidney cancer cells in the lab. This, in turn, slows down cancer growth.  published in the journal Nature Biotechnology earlier this month, researchers found that CRISPR technology can target and alter   fusion genes, shrinking tumors caused by liver and prostate cancer in lab mice. The technique works by removing mutated DNA in cancer cells and replacing it with a gene that kills the unhealthy cells, while leaving healthy cells alone. Ã¢ÂÂOther types of cancer treatments target the foot soldiers of the army,Ã¢ÂÂ said study author Dr.   Luo, of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

Queens assistant principal Michael Scaduto shacked up with a teacher he was supervising while cozying up to another teacher on his staff and then pressured each to give him $5, 000 for a fictional homeless child suffering from cancer named Ã¢ÂÂTom,Ã¢ÂÂ according to school investigators. The Special Commissioner of Investigation for city schools found the lying Lothario cashed in further when he convinced the father of the teacher Scaduto was living with to fork over $150, 000 for a down payment on a house the couple bought together. Scaduto, 36, carried out his   schemes while serving as assistant principal and athletic director at the HS for Construction Trades, Engineering and Architecture, in Ozone Park. With investigators at his heels, he quickly resigned in August 2015 from the city Department of Education  Ã¢ÂÂ   which has since banned him from future employment  Ã¢ÂÂ   and landed a   gig at MacArthur HS in Levittown, LI. Ã¢ÂÂI wanted that community feel,Ã¢ÂÂ Scaduto told the LI Herald news site when he started. One Queens teacher told investigators she began a relationship with Scaduto in December 2014 and they bought a house together with her dadÃ¢ÂÂs cash. In June 2015, she was upset to learn Scaduto was involved with another teacher, an SCI report said. The first teacher said she gave Scaduto $5, 000 Ã¢ÂÂpurportedly for a sick childÃ¢ÂÂ and $10, 000 for legal expenses because he claimed he was under investigation for his romantic affairs. The second teacher told investigators she and Scaduto had a Ã¢ÂÂclose emotional relationship but maintained it was not sexual,Ã¢ÂÂ SCI says. As the two grew closer, Scaduto told her he was a Ã¢ÂÂBig Brother mentorÃ¢ÂÂ to    Ã¢ÂÂTom,Ã¢ÂÂ who had cancer. He later told her Ã¢ÂÂTomÃ¢ÂÂ had died and he was raising money for his homeless family and mother, who also was battling cancer. Scaduto also told the second teacher he was under an SCI investigation  Ã¢ÂÂ   which was false at the time  Ã¢ÂÂ   working several   jobs to pay for a lawyer and Ã¢ÂÂexhausted. Ã¢ÂÂ She gave him another $10, 000. But the second teacher was suspicious. She Ã¢ÂÂconducted several surveillancesÃ¢ÂÂ of Scaduto when he claimed to have lawyer appointments or to be working other jobs, the report said. She found Scaduto Ã¢ÂÂnever left his residence. Ã¢ÂÂ The first teacher finally told the second Ã¢ÂÂit was all lies; there was no Tom or SCI investigation. Ã¢ÂÂ The second teacher confronted Scaduto, who admitted he lied to her and returned the money, according to the report. Scaduto, who joined the DOE in 2007, made $122, 236 at the Queens vocational high school in  . His base salary at MacArthur HS is $134, 310.

But the latest research shows that damaged cells actually increase the risk of healthy Ã¢ÂÂbystanderÃ¢ÂÂ cells also getting sick. Ã¢ÂÂWe learned the damaged cells send signals to the surrounding, unaffected cells and likely modify the tissuesÃ¢ÂÂ microenvironments,Ã¢ÂÂ Francis Cucinotta, the studyÃ¢ÂÂs lead researcher,   Ã¢ÂÂThose signals seem to inspire the healthy cells to mutate, thereby causing additional tumors or cancers. Ã¢ÂÂ According to 2013 data from the Radiation Assessment Detector on NASAÃ¢ÂÂs Curiosity Rover, a roundtrip mission to Mars would expose an astronaut to 0. 66 sieverts of radiation. That level is 13 times higher than what someone working at a nuclear power plant can be exposed to in a year. In addition to cancer, cosmic ray exposure can also cause cataracts, circulatory diseases and acute radiation syndromes. Researchers say this discovery calls for a lot more thorough research and risk analysis. A Mars astronaut would spend at least 900 days on the red planet and more than a year traveling through deep space. Cucinotta said current radiation shields would only Ã¢ÂÂmodestlyÃ¢ÂÂ decrease the amount of radiation exposure.

The study forecast a mixed message for New York state residents, predicting more cancer cases Ã¢ÂÂ   with roughly the same number of deaths. In 2016, there will be 110, 280 new cases ito go along with 34, 910 deaths by cancer this year, researchers said. A year ago, it was estimated thereÃ¢ÂÂd be 107, 840 new cases of cancer diagnosed in the Empire State and 34, 600 deaths. Dr. Otis Brawley, the groupÃ¢ÂÂs chief medical officer, said the increase of new cancer cases are based on a rise in the increase of New YorkÃ¢ÂÂs overall population and the number of people, more like to to be diagnosed. Those numbers, he said, are still favorable to New York state residents. Ã¢ÂÂOverall itÃ¢ÂÂs not bad at all,Ã¢ÂÂ Brawley said of the New York data. More American men than women died of cancer between 2008 and 2012, with New York State residents suffering slightly less than the national average. There were 193. 8 cancer deaths per 100, 000 men in New York state during that span, compared to the national average of 207. 9.  There were 141. 7  cancer deaths per 100, 000 women here from 2008 through 2012 vs. the national female average of 145. 4. Despite encouraging findings overall, researchers said thereÃ¢ÂÂs still much work to be done. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre gratified to see cancer death rates continuing to drop,Ã¢ÂÂ said Brawley.

Being a founder of the Hot Young Widows Club didnÃ¢ÂÂt bring me the wisdom to know what to say when IÃ¢ÂÂm faced with death and sickness and grief. Most people are illiterate in the language of grief, and I count myself among that number. I am trying to learn and teach at the same time, but I am beginning to think that there is no right thing to say, and that perhaps it is okay for language to fail us at this time. ItÃ¢ÂÂs okay for us to stumble for words when weÃ¢ÂÂre faced with death and sickness and grief; itÃ¢ÂÂs okay for stupid and awkward ones to slip out where weÃ¢ÂÂd hoped sweet and comforting ones would have appeared.

2161,"How cool would it be to stop cancer dead in its tracks using a vaccine that would work regardless of cancer type? It turns out that humanity is already thinking along those lines, and itÃ¢ÂÂs looking to introduce a type of Ã¢ÂÂuniversal cancer vaccineÃ¢ÂÂ that would be able to trigger the humanÃ¢ÂÂs body   defenses to kill cancerous cells. Specifically, researchers at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany, have initiated a limited safety human trial, after experiments on mice showed impressive results.   Unlike other vaccines that are supposed to prevent a certain disease, the cancer vaccine would only be administered to cancer patients. Each vaccine therapy would actually be a customized treatment,   as it would use pieces of RNA extracted from the patientÃ¢ÂÂs cancer cells to trigger a reaction from his or her immune system. Ã¢ÂÂ[Such] vaccines are fast and inexpensive to produce, and virtually any tumor antigen can be encoded by RNA,Ã¢ÂÂ  . Ã¢ÂÂThus, the nanoparticulate RNA immunotherapy approach introduced here may be regarded as a universally applicable novel vaccine class for cancer immunotherapy. Ã¢ÂÂ Because cancer cells can look and behave like normal cells, the immune system does not attack them. However, by using a   antigen, the vaccine would fool the immune system into initiating an   attack against all cells that express it, taking out tumors anywhere in the body. To deliver it, scientists have coated the cancer RNA in a fatty acid membrane that has a slightly negative charge. This allows it to travel anywhere in the body, including spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. Once the vaccine meets dendritic immune cells, the bodyÃ¢ÂÂs T cells get to inspect the RNA information. The next response is the neutralization of all tumorous cells that are similar in design. Tests conducted on mice showed that their immune systems were able to combat cancer aggressively. The team started a limited human trial that includes three patients with melanoma. The point of the test was to see whether the vaccine is safe for humans, and the results are promising. The initial results are promising, with side effects including   symptoms, which are better than what comes with chemotherapy treatments. A larger trial can only start in the following years. The team has to wait 12 months to perform   tests on the three patients before moving to the next step, which involves the actual test of the vaccineÃ¢ÂÂs efficiency at killing cancer.",cancer,The cure for cancer could be as simple as aÃÂ vaccine,2161.0,2161.0,161.0,
2162,"Ã¢ÂÂNonprofitÃ¢ÂÂ hospitals turn out to be some of the nationÃ¢ÂÂs most profitable. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs just part of the lunacy that increasingly dominates the US   system. Researchers at Johns Hopkins and Washington and Lee Universities report that seven of AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs 10 most profitable hospitals are officially not for profit. That status entitles them to huge state and federal tax breaks  Ã¢ÂÂ   whose value has doubled in recent years  Ã¢ÂÂ   for Ã¢ÂÂcharity care and community benefit. Ã¢ÂÂ Topping the list is the Gundersen Lutheran Medical Center in La Crosse, Wis. which netted $302. 5 million profit from patient services alone (not including donations, etc.) in 2013. A   outlet will pay taxes and returns to investors. Nonprofits wind up paying huge sums to executives  Ã¢ÂÂ   and plowing cash into gaining more market share. None of the   hospitals is in New York, by the way. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs because the most profitable facilities generally dominate and even monopolize the market in their area. And that gives them enormous leverage when setting prices and negotiating reimbursement from private insurers  Ã¢ÂÂ   whose hands are tied because they need those hospitals to be part of their network to attract paying customers. As Dr. Marty Makary of Johns Hopkins wrote in The Wall Street Journal back in 2014: Ã¢ÂÂWhen youÃ¢ÂÂre the only game in town, you call the shots. Ã¢ÂÂ And the biggest losers in all this, of course, are John and Jane Q. Public. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a basic economic fact that competition breeds lower prices and greater choices, while monopolies lead to higher prices, less choice and worse service. But ObamaCare pushes hospital mergers and consolidations, which have been rising at record rates. The law directly bribes doctors and hospitals to form Ã¢ÂÂaccountable care organizations,Ã¢ÂÂ and it also encourages   consolidation  Ã¢ÂÂ   which forces hospitals to do the same to preserve negotiating leverage. WeÃ¢ÂÂre certainly not opposed to an honest profit, nor to charities doing good by doing well. But New Yorkers are all too familiar with how nonprofits get abused to serve insiders more than the public. And the government shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be forcing mass consolidation in any industry. These forces are also turning traditional, individual and   doctorsÃ¢ÂÂ offices into an endangered species.

Considering Sunday matinees are the only shows MuÃÂ±oz plays, you may wonder what kept him away. Blame it on cancer. Ã¢ÂÂI was diagnosed in October,Ã¢ÂÂ MuÃÂ±oz tells The Post. Ã¢ÂÂI spent about six weeks not wanting to think about it, face, it, deal with it.

Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂd just call out [sick] or push through,Ã¢ÂÂ says the slender, goateed MuÃÂ±oz, whose job includes observing every Ã¢ÂÂHamiltonÃ¢ÂÂ performance for any new nuances, and to go on for Miranda if needed. (Good luck with that, MuÃÂ±oz says: Ã¢ÂÂLinÃ¢ÂÂs such a workhorse  Ã¢ÂÂ   if both his legs fell off, heÃ¢ÂÂd wheel himself out there! Ã¢ÂÂ) But in November, MuÃÂ±oz did what he had to do: He left the show to undergo surgery, followed by radiation treatments that depleted him, then physical therapy to get him strong enough to take the stage. All told, he missed two months of Sundays, in which cast member Jon Rua often went on in his stead. Another show might have gone on with an alternate understudy. Not Ã¢ÂÂHamilton. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThere was no thought at all about [replacing him],Ã¢ÂÂ says Thomas Kail, the director of both Ã¢ÂÂHamiltonÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂIn the Heights,Ã¢ÂÂ the 2008 Tony winner in which MuÃÂ±oz also alternated with Miranda. Ã¢ÂÂJaviÃ¢ÂÂs someone who has given so much,Ã¢ÂÂ Kail continues. Ã¢ÂÂNow we wanted to make sure he had what he needed to be well, and to know he wasnÃ¢ÂÂt alone.

His eyes fill with tears as he recalls how the man who plays Aaron Burr, HamiltonÃ¢ÂÂs frenemy, organized a food drive: Meals, paid for by members of the cast, arrived at MuÃÂ±ozÃ¢ÂÂs Astoria apartment every day. And, yes, his parents were there for him  Ã¢ÂÂ   and knew just what he was up against: Some 12 years ago, within a period of six months, they were both diagnosed with cancer. MuÃÂ±oz took a year off from acting and auditioning to take a day job, moving back into his boyhood home in Brooklyn to help with meals, laundry and doctor appointments. Happily, his parents recovered, and on Feb. 14 celebrated their 56th anniversary by watching their son star in Ã¢ÂÂHamilton. Ã¢ÂÂ That day, just five weeks after his last radiation treatment, MuÃÂ±oz showed why some fans call him Ã¢ÂÂthe sexy Hamilton. Ã¢ÂÂ Though heÃ¢ÂÂs tailored his Alexander on MirandaÃ¢ÂÂs, MuÃÂ±oz brings an edgy intensity to the role. MirandaÃ¢ÂÂs    Alexander is someone youÃ¢ÂÂd proudly introduce to your parents; MuÃÂ±ozÃ¢ÂÂs is someone youÃ¢ÂÂd sneak up the back stairs. Then again, any comparisons between the two make him uncomfortable. Ã¢ÂÂWe work so hard and so well together that, in my mind, I find it almost impossible to separate our versions,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. (Well, maybe Mel Brooks can  Ã¢ÂÂ   or thinks he can. MuÃÂ±oz says the Ã¢ÂÂ   ManÃ¢ÂÂ came backstage one Sunday and said, Ã¢ÂÂSo youÃ¢ÂÂre better than him, right? Yeah, yeah, so heÃ¢ÂÂs the writer, but youÃ¢ÂÂre better! Ã¢ÂÂ) As far as KailÃ¢ÂÂs concerned, MirandaÃ¢ÂÂs created a role thatÃ¢ÂÂs bigger than he is.

Thompson, 50, who took office in 2014 after defeating longtime incumbent Charles Hynes in a Democratic primary, did not disclose the type of cancer he has or when he was diagnosed. But a source said the cancer is Ã¢ÂÂaggressiveÃ¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ   and added that Thompson has a Ã¢ÂÂtough road ahead of him. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂSince May heÃ¢ÂÂs been out of the office regarding a health issue. HeÃ¢ÂÂs extremely   but heÃ¢ÂÂs been out of the office for long periods of time,Ã¢ÂÂ another source said. Thompson, sources said, has been getting paperwork delivered to his Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, home, and has been working from there while undergoing treatment following the diagnosis. His staff had been only told he was suffering from a bad back, according to the same source, and many only learned the news after reading a statement Thompson issued Tuesday. Ã¢ÂÂWhat really triggered the chatter was the West Indian Day Parade, all the politicians, thatÃ¢ÂÂs their big day well he wasnÃ¢ÂÂt there. That really started the chatter, everyone saying whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on with this guy?Ã¢ÂÂ the source said. In his statement, Thompson sounded optimistic. Ã¢ÂÂRecently, I was diagnosed with cancer. As a man of intense faith, I intend to fight and win the battle against this disease   Ã¢ÂÂ¦     and respectfully ask that you honor my familyÃ¢ÂÂs need and wish for privacy during this time,Ã¢ÂÂ the statement said. But sources said the diagnosis calls into question whether the DA will be up for running for reelection. Ã¢ÂÂThe next election for Brooklyn DA is right around the corner. ItÃ¢ÂÂs all about the primary in September but you need to get your name on the ballet by June. Is he going to run? thatÃ¢ÂÂs the big question,Ã¢ÂÂ the source said. His    Eric Gonzalez, will be taking over the primary duties, he added. Gonzalez is the first Latino to hold the position as Chief Assistant DA, and has served as ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs advisor on legal matters. The former prosecutor has worked at the Brooklyn DA for the past 15 years, spanning multiple administrations. He was appointed to the spot of Chief ADA in October 2014, by Thompson. Speculation is already swirling over who might replace Thompson should he be unable to run. Ã¢ÂÂThe big question is whether heÃ¢ÂÂs going to run and who is going to run against him if he does run?Ã¢ÂÂ in a primary. Sources said possible candidates include Gonzalez and Anne J. Swern of the Brooklyn Defender Services, a former prosecutor for over 33 years in the Brooklyn DAÃ¢ÂÂs office. Thompson was a successful trial lawyer in private practice who made headlines defending Nafissatou Diallo, an African immigrant working as a housekeeper in the Sofitel hotel in Midtown in her   case against Dominique   who led the International Monetary Fund.   was eventually cleared when Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance Jr. said he lacked enough evidence to bring charges. It was a complicated debut year for Mr. Thompson, who after a rancorous campaign against the longtime incumbent, Charles J. Hynes, assumed his post in January 2014 promising not only to revitalize an office that had fallen prey to scandal, but also to recalibrate the way that BrooklynÃ¢ÂÂs   system deals with its minority communities. Rising to power on the same progressive wave that swept Mayor Bill de Blasio into City Hall, he took over the position flush with optimism, vowing to reinvestigate dozens of his predecessorÃ¢ÂÂs dubious convictions and to end  Ã¢ÂÂ   against the wishes of the police  Ã¢ÂÂ   the prosecution of minor marijuana busts. But even as he set about enacting his agenda, events overtook him. Seven months into his tenure, Eric Garner died in Staten Island after being put in a chokehold by Officer Daniel Pantaleo.

2167,"Cancer was an enormous blessing. It saved my life. That may sound crazy, but itÃ¢ÂÂs true. The disease taught me that our greatest trials can be our greatest opportunities for growing and finding purpose. When the doctor diagnosed me with Stage 3 breast cancer in March 2008, I was 46 years old and told that I had a 10 percent or less chance of living if I did not begin treatment immediately. I knew I needed to do it  Ã¢ÂÂ   I wanted to beat cancer. But I had a secret that I could not share with anyone. I had been living a huge lie: While traveling around the United States, lecturing people on nutrition and talking about being a   triathlete, I routinely had bile on my tongue. Literally. I struggled with bulimia, making myself sick eight to 10 times per day  Ã¢ÂÂ   to the point where I was throwing up blood  Ã¢ÂÂ   and I was too ashamed to admit it. My eating disorder began during sophomore year of college when somebody told me the secret of being able to eat whatever I wanted: Just throw it up. I binged on bagels, ice cream, waffles, cake. It all went down my throat and came right back out. Soon there was a voice in my head that I called the TaskMaster, the SlaveMaster, the Liar, the Deceiver. It would tell me, Ã¢ÂÂYouÃ¢ÂÂre worthless, youÃ¢ÂÂre fat, you might as well be dead. Ã¢ÂÂ That voice commanded me to throw up and I rationalized bulimia as the only way to stay thin. But it also became an escape from feeling inadequate. Vomiting gave me an endorphin chemical reaction. I lived on the high for a few seconds and then felt terrible again. I stopped throwing up when I was pregnant  Ã¢ÂÂ   I felt responsible for the life inside me  Ã¢ÂÂ   but after my three sons were born I went back to it. It became like a drug  Ã¢ÂÂ   even while I worked as a dietitian and ran triathlons. At night, while everyone in the house slept, I went in the kitchen and binged. I got so good at vomiting that sometimes I could do it without my fingers. ThereÃ¢ÂÂd be days when my kids banged on the bathroom door as I threw up and heard the demon voice: Ã¢ÂÂYouÃ¢ÂÂre a bad mother. YouÃ¢ÂÂre fat. YouÃ¢ÂÂre worthless. Ã¢ÂÂ When I got diagnosed with cancer, I stood     my weight was 105 pounds, and hereÃ¢ÂÂs how sick I was: I looked forward to the chemotherapy. Ã¢ÂÂYou may be nauseous from the medication,Ã¢ÂÂ my doctor told me. That, I thought to myself, will be great. It will help keep me thin. At the same time, I instinctively knew I would have to stop being bulimic. I knew that if I wanted to see my kids grow up, the bulimia had to stop. Making myself sick while receiving chemotherapy would have killed me. I went cold turkey, and it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt easy. I would have cravings to make myself vomit, and I would hear the demon voice. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs when I told myself, Ã¢ÂÂKaren, you canÃ¢ÂÂt. If you do it, you will die. Ã¢ÂÂ I fought the voices. I wanted nothing more than to live. Cancer was a   call. Through it all, I knew I needed to continue competing in triathlons. It may sound like another compulsion, but it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt. At certain points in my life I had exercised to craziness, but this was different. By the time of my diagnosis, I had earned a slot in the Age Group World Triathlon Championships. I had to show my kids that I was still strong, that I was still somebody who could compete in that kind of a race. Crumbling to a disease does not bear well for your fight. It took three doctors for me to find one whoÃ¢ÂÂd clear me to race. A lot of cancer patients wear masks to keep from contracting other peopleÃ¢ÂÂs germs; racing in a triathlon is the opposite of that. So I can see why the doctors were concerned. But I needed to do it. I finally found a doctor who agreed that if I maintained a certain level of red and white blood cells, then I could race. Luckily, my cells never dropped below the level that heÃ¢ÂÂd set. Over a   period following the diagnosis, I completed seven triathlons while getting chemotherapy. That experience totally changed my perspective on what it means to be a champion. Every Wednesday, I went right from training in the pool to chemotherapy. For 36 hours after chemo, it was nonstop nausea, and there was zero chance of me being able to train then. I was praying to stop throwing up and, in the midst of it, wondered how I ever made myself sick. It was such an awakening. Then IÃ¢ÂÂd start training seriously on Sunday  Ã¢ÂÂ   biking, running, swimming  Ã¢ÂÂ   and by the time I was due for my next chemo, which happened every other week, I would feel fantastic. It took two weeks for me to feel good. But then the chemo treatment would leave me feeling miserable. IÃ¢ÂÂd start the cycle all over again. I knew that if I wanted to see my kids grow up, the bulimia had to stop. Before cancer, I used to think these races were only about winning. But during my first triathlon after beginning chemo, I learned differently. This race, the Championships, took place in Vancouver, BC, and competitors got hypothermia while battling waves in frigid English Bay. I wasnÃ¢ÂÂt sure I would make it  Ã¢ÂÂ   but I couldnÃ¢ÂÂt let down my family members, doctors and other cancer patients. They were all rooting for me. A side effect of chemo is that you lose feeling in your fingers. Upon exiting the water my frozen fingers wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt work. I painstakingly wiggled out of my wet suit and watched all the other racers passing me by. Then I struggled to get my bicycling helmet buckled! I ended up second to last  Ã¢ÂÂ   and I was exhilarated. For the first time in my life, I recognized that winning does not count as the only victory. In 2013,   after a single radical mastectomy and radiation treatment, my weight was around 110 pounds, where it remains to this day. The bulimia is gone. Words still come into my head sometimes, calling me names, but I donÃ¢ÂÂt listen. I know theyÃ¢ÂÂre not true, and IÃ¢ÂÂve stopped keeping the bulimia a secret.

Three years ago, Riley was informed she had cancer, and was required to have various treatments on her left breast, which resulted in a mastectomy. In September 2015, one of her implants ruptured and she subsequently suffered from lymphedema, which created significant swelling to her left side and caused discomfort with pressure and pain. Her seatbelt, in its regular form, created Ã¢ÂÂgreat discomfortÃ¢ÂÂ in her chest when driving  Ã¢ÂÂ   and so to alleviate the pain, she placed the bulldog clip at the retractor above her right shoulder.

Ã¢ÂÂIt just lifts the belt away from my chest just a small amount so it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt go tight across my left side and cause me pain. Ã¢ÂÂ After the officer noted the clip, Riley explained her condition and why she needed relief from the seatbelt. Ã¢ÂÂHe said to me: Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs not my problem,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂI told him and showed him that I still had the belt on, and the officer just said that my issues werenÃ¢ÂÂt his problem. Ã¢ÂÂHe asked me to pull over to the side of the road, and another officer walked over to my car and asked why I was still there. I explained to him about my breast cancer and my seatbelt, and that officer didnÃ¢ÂÂt care either. Ã¢ÂÂ Riley pleaded with the officers that she would take the clip off the seatbelt, but they insisted what she had done was Ã¢ÂÂa breach and they had to fine her for incorrectly wearing a seatbelt. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThe officer walked away with my license, and kept me waiting for 35 minutes,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂThen when he returned with the ticket, he said, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve done you a favor, and the ticket will only be for $360.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂI was so cross and upset by how rude they were to me. I showed it to my son, and I was just in tears. Ã¢ÂÂ Riley, who admitted she didnÃ¢ÂÂt have a doctorÃ¢ÂÂs certificate with her to prove she had breast cancer, said she had no idea she needed permission to make a small alteration to her belt if it meant she was no longer in pain. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs unsafe to be driving in that sort of pain. I was on my own and didnÃ¢ÂÂt have someone in the car to help,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs just really unfortunate because the officers were so rude and not understanding of my situation. When they said my health problems werenÃ¢ÂÂt their problems   Ã¢ÂÂ¦     that really upset me, to be frank. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ After the incident, Riley, who is a learning resource developer, went to her oncologist, who said they had Ã¢ÂÂnever heard of a story like itÃ¢ÂÂ and provided her with a doctorÃ¢ÂÂs certificate to help fight the fine. Ã¢ÂÂBasically, the officer said my only option to dispute the ticket was to get a doctorÃ¢ÂÂs certificate, and take the matter to court,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂIf I was going around without a seatbelt, I would completely understand the fine and pay it. But this was just a minor alteration. Ã¢ÂÂ According to New South Wales Transport, Riley had in fact broken the law because she didnÃ¢ÂÂt have a medical certificate with her at the time of infringement. Ã¢ÂÂDrivers or passengers may be exempt from wearing a seatbelt if they carry a medical certificate saying that a seatbelt cannot be worn due to a medical condition,Ã¢ÂÂ an NSW Transport spokesman said. Ã¢ÂÂAccording to NSW road rules, all drivers and passengers are required to wear an approved seatbelt. Tampering with an approved seatbelt may mean it no longer meets compliance standards. Ã¢ÂÂModification to an approved seatbelt can reduce the performance of the safety features and increase the likelihood of an injury during a crash. Ã¢ÂÂEnforcing road rules is the responsibility of the NSW Police Force. Ã¢ÂÂ After being contacted by news. com. au, a police spokesman said they had been in contact with Riley and Ã¢ÂÂthe issue is being resolved. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThey were very apologetic about what had happened,Ã¢ÂÂ Riley said. The spokesman was unable to advise how they would be assisting Riley with the fine.",cancer,Breast cancer patient fined for wearing an alteredÃÂ seatbelt,2169.0,2169.0,169.0,
2170,"Vice President Joe Biden last year tragically lost his son Beau to brain cancer at the age of 46. No parent should ever have to bury a child. And now Biden, ever the fighter, has responded with a personal commitment to eradicating cancer: Ã¢ÂÂa new moon shot. Ã¢ÂÂ At Tuesday nightÃ¢ÂÂs State of the Union address, President Obama handed him the keys to a new national effort against cancer. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm putting Joe in charge of mission control,Ã¢ÂÂ Obama said. Biden tweeted the focus for this initiative, which is to Ã¢ÂÂincrease resources  Ã¢ÂÂ   both private and public  Ã¢ÂÂ   to fight cancer. Ã¢ÂÂ And also to Ã¢ÂÂbreak down silos and bring all the cancer fighters together  Ã¢ÂÂ   to work together, share information, and end cancer as we know it. Ã¢ÂÂ While we donÃ¢ÂÂt yet know where the moneyÃ¢ÂÂs going to come from, the sentiment is certainly laudable, and top cancer centers around the country  Ã¢ÂÂ   including MD Anderson in Houston, Sloan Kettering Memorial here in New York, Dana Farber in Boston and many others  Ã¢ÂÂ   certainly duplicate efforts that could be streamlined. (Though in my experience, the top researchers each know what the others are up to, and they frequently collaborate.) There is also no doubt that weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing important developments in the war on cancer. Major advances in immunotherapies, including vaccines, have enabled oncologists to directly target the surface of cancerous cells instead of using toxic chemicals that affect the whole body in an effort to stop cancer growth. Cancer is often able to survive and grow by hiding from the immune system, but top researchers are finding ways to counter that for many of our worst cancers including lung, breast, melanoma and bone. The treatments are often more effective and less toxic than traditional chemotherapy. And genetic therapies are being developed to counter the mutations that cause cancer to grow. So whatÃ¢ÂÂs the catch? Well, President Obama is the wrong    for the war on cancer. His signature health care program, ObamaCare, may be responsible for signing up more than 16 million people who were previously uninsured, but the kind of health insurance theyÃ¢ÂÂre getting will hardly pay for the new treatments. ObamaCare is    ; it usually pairs a high deductible (typically more than $5, 000 per year) with   care in a narrow network that excludes most top doctors, hospitals and drugs. Plus, with all its regulations, taxes and penalties ($500 billion in new taxes in the first 10 years) ObamaCare stifles the very innovation necessary for drug companies to develop new cures. Research and development is currently growing much faster in Asia, India and Europe than in the United States. And evolving,   cancer doesnÃ¢ÂÂt suit     treatments. Exciting new cancer drugs will lead to more personalized care, meaning that the vaccine or directed antibody may respond to the proteins of your tumor but not someone elseÃ¢ÂÂs. Expensive drugs that only work well for small numbers of people are difficult to justify to insurance companies that participate in ObamaCare, especially when these treatments are very expensive. And targeted therapies routinely cost over $100, 000 a year per patient. Well worth it if itÃ¢ÂÂs your life on the line, but ObamaCare isnÃ¢ÂÂt designed to respond to your personalized medical needs. ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs cancer pronouncement on Tuesday brings to mind another declared war on cancer  Ã¢ÂÂ   by President Richard Nixon, 45 years ago. But Nixon immediately put his money where his mouth was, asking for $100 million and signing the National Cancer Act into law. This act gave the National Cancer Institute the power and budget to develop many new lifesaving treatments. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no doubt Joe BidenÃ¢ÂÂs heart is in the right place. But this president is unlikely to give him the resources and flexibility he needs to succeed.",cancer,BidenÃ¢ÂÂs cancer Ã¢ÂÂmoon shotÃ¢ÂÂ is a grand idea thatÃ¢ÂÂsÃÂ doomed,2170.0,2170.0,170.0,
2171,"Do most people who get cancer simply have bad luck? Or is cancer something they might be able to prevent? Two new studies suggest the latter. A study   found that between 40  Ã¢ÂÂ   70% of cancer cases could be prevented if we changed our lifestyles by doing things like staying at a healthy weight, quitting smoking, reducing alcohol consumption and getting 2 ÃÂ½ hours of exercise a week. Ã¢ÂÂA large proportion of cancers are due to environmental factors and can be prevented by lifestyle modification,Ã¢ÂÂ the authors concluded.  revealed that it is mostly environmental and external factors like smoking, drinking, diet, getting too much sun and exposure to toxic chemicals that cause cancer, rather than intrinsic factors like random cell mutations. Intrinsic factors accounted for just 10% to 30% of peopleÃ¢ÂÂs lifetime risk of getting cancer, while extrinsic risks accounted for 70% to 90% for most common cancer types, the study showed. Ã¢ÂÂCancer risk is heavily influenced by extrinsic factors,Ã¢ÂÂ the study researchers, who work at Stony Brook University in New York, concluded. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs good news for many, as it means that cancer might be more avoidable  Ã¢ÂÂ   through changes in our lifestyles  Ã¢ÂÂ   than we previously thought. Ã¢ÂÂEnvironmental factors play an important role in cancer incidence and they are modifiable through lifestyle changes   vaccinations,Ã¢ÂÂ the researchers write in Nature. Or as the researchers in JAMA Oncology put it: Ã¢ÂÂA substantial cancer burden may be prevented through lifestyle modification. Ã¢ÂÂ Many experts cheered this finding. Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂs no question whatÃ¢ÂÂs at stake here,Ã¢ÂÂ  . Ã¢ÂÂThis informs whether or not we expend energy on prevention. Ã¢ÂÂ The authors of the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Oncology noted that Ã¢ÂÂprevention should remain a priority for cancer control. Ã¢ÂÂ These conclusions do fly in the face of other cancer research. A report in the journal Science published earlier in 2015 concluded just the opposite: that roughly   of cancers were caused by intrinsic factors. (These findings came to be known as the Ã¢ÂÂbad luckÃ¢ÂÂ hypothesis.) But the Stony Brook researchers concluded that the incidence of cancer is too high for that to be true.

2173,"HOUSTON  Ã¢ÂÂ   The chemotherapy has diminished Craig SagerÃ¢ÂÂs   chestnut hair to a few unruly strands, and on this day of hope, a simple green   and blue shorts adorn the man known by millions for his ostentatious wardrobe and easy rapport with the NBAÃ¢ÂÂs elite. He methodically extended a long, skinny arm to an IV pole holding the stem cells he is counting on to save his life. There was silence as he cradled the tube, watching the crimson liquid drip, drip, drip in a perfect cadence into the cannula feeding it into his   body. TNTÃ¢ÂÂs most beloved basketball broadcaster received a rare third bone marrow transplant on Wednesday as an aggressive form of leukemia continues to take its toll. The    Sager has battled acute myeloid leukemia since 2014, and announced in March that he was no longer in remission. Sager knows the odds are against him. Yet he is unfazed. Ã¢ÂÂI like to gamble,Ã¢ÂÂ he told the Associated Press. Ã¢ÂÂI like to bet on horses, I like to bet on dogs, I like to bet on a lot of things. IÃ¢ÂÂve bet on a lot of things with a lot higher odds than this. Ã¢ÂÂ Two other times Sager has received a bone marrow transplant with stem cells, and in both instances it put him into remission for several months. His son, Craig Sager II, was the donor then. This time, the anonymous    donor was considered a perfect match. Sager has been hospitalized for a month and has another   stay ahead. He hasnÃ¢ÂÂt thought a lot about the random man whose bone marrow could change everything for him. But when he learned of his age, he expressed a possibly only   concern. Ã¢ÂÂMy only thing was I was afraid that when he signed up to be the donor, he may have been in some drunk fraternity house, trying to impress his date,Ã¢ÂÂ Sager said with a smile. Ã¢ÂÂAnd they call him up the next day and say: Ã¢ÂÂWant to come down to the hospital?Ã¢ÂÂ and heÃ¢ÂÂs like: Ã¢ÂÂWhat? Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ His fears turned out to be unfounded. Ã¢ÂÂHe came through,Ã¢ÂÂ Sager said. It is the latest of close to 100 procedures Sager has endured in his   fight and it was performed at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Sager began the transplant at about 11:30 a. m. Central time and it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt complete until more than 10 hours later. Dr. Muzaffar Qazilbash, SagerÃ¢ÂÂs stem cell transplantation physician, researched thousands of such transplants at MD Anderson over the last 15 years to illustrate just how uncommon SagerÃ¢ÂÂs procedure was. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs less than 1 percent of the total number of transplants,Ã¢ÂÂ Qazilbash said. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs very rare to have three transplants. Ã¢ÂÂ Sager, who has worked for TNT for more than three decades, calls himself coachable and said heÃ¢ÂÂs open to trying anything doctors believe might help. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve had every chemo in the alphabet, most of them more than once,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂSome of them that arenÃ¢ÂÂt even in the alphabet, theyÃ¢ÂÂre just numbers  Ã¢ÂÂ   clinical trials. But I bet if you added all those up, it would have to be like   or  . IÃ¢ÂÂve had 23 bone marrow aspirations. Having one isnÃ¢ÂÂt fun and IÃ¢ÂÂve had 23. So thatÃ¢ÂÂs been tough. Ã¢ÂÂ Despite the rigors of treatment and how they can ravage his body, heÃ¢ÂÂs never thought about giving up. In fact, he gets angry when he meets other patients who say theyÃ¢ÂÂve grown weary of fighting. Ã¢ÂÂMan, life is too beautiful, too wonderful, thereÃ¢ÂÂs just too many things,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs not just you. ItÃ¢ÂÂs your family and kids and all. Fight. Fight until the end. Fight as hard as you can. Ã¢ÂÂ With his radiant smile and   persona, it takes time to peel back the layers of positivity and catch a glimpse of how hard that fight can be. Ã¢ÂÂHis attitude is (that) nobody wants to hear it,Ã¢ÂÂ said Stacy Sager, his wife,   caregiver and No. 1 fan. Ã¢ÂÂAnd so it makes you reflect on yourself and the things that you say when youÃ¢ÂÂre complaining about little things in life and trivial things and it just puts things in perspective. Ã¢ÂÂ But there are times, often as night creeps into early morning, when it all becomes too much. No medication can help. Ã¢ÂÂFight. Fight until the end. Fight as hard as you can.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve never had any of those days where IÃ¢ÂÂve actually said Ã¢ÂÂWhy me,Ã¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂI canÃ¢ÂÂt do it,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂBut IÃ¢ÂÂll have some dark nights where IÃ¢ÂÂll be here by myself and maybe getting some medicine thatÃ¢ÂÂs making me jump around like a rabbit. And IÃ¢ÂÂm in pain and IÃ¢ÂÂve got chills and IÃ¢ÂÂve got fever and IÃ¢ÂÂve got everything mixed into one and IÃ¢ÂÂm throwing up and have diarrhea   Ã¢ÂÂ¦     and IÃ¢ÂÂll just say: Ã¢ÂÂStacy, I need you. I need you.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂAnd sheÃ¢ÂÂll come to me and just hold me and it just makes it better,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. A few days before his transplant, Stacy came down with a bad cold and doctors sent her home, fearful sheÃ¢ÂÂd transmit her illness to her husband. Hall of Famer and TNT colleague Charles Barkley heard she couldnÃ¢ÂÂt be there for a couple of days and hopped on a plane from Phoenix. The problem was that Sir Charles had hip replacement surgery less than a month ago and wasnÃ¢ÂÂt cleared to travel. He said his doctor was livid when he learned Barkley had defied orders and flown halfway across the country. Barkley informed the doctor that it was an emergency  Ã¢ÂÂ   though it was hard to know who was there for whom. Ã¢ÂÂCraig Sager is one of the most interesting people IÃ¢ÂÂve ever met,Ã¢ÂÂ Barkley said. Ã¢ÂÂWe go to see Sager to cheer him up and by the time you leave youÃ¢ÂÂre like, Ã¢ÂÂIs anything wrong with him?Ã¢ÂÂ He has the most positive attitude   Ã¢ÂÂ¦     when you go to try and cheer him up, his attitude is so upbeat he cheers you up. Ã¢ÂÂ Sager has found inspiration in a little girl who lost her fight with cancer before her ninth birthday. He befriended Lacey Holsworth and her family while working on a story about her illness and remained friends with her parents after she died in April 2014. Holsworth had cheered on the Michigan State basketball team and  . Last weekend, her parents visited Sager in his Houston hospital room. They left him with a more tangible reminder of her bravery. Ã¢ÂÂThey brought me little LaceyÃ¢ÂÂs boots that she used to always wear to games and a picture of her wearing them,Ã¢ÂÂ Sager said, clutching the   cheetah footwear accessorized with laces made from silk ribbons. Ã¢ÂÂThat little girl was so amazing. Fought for all of those years, was always positive, always cheerful, always brought other peopleÃ¢ÂÂs spirits up. So if IÃ¢ÂÂm laying here feeling bad, I just think about Lacey and it puts everything in perspective. Ã¢ÂÂ Sager is also bolstered by his drive to be back on the sideline for the NBA season. He doesnÃ¢ÂÂt expect to have recovered from WednesdayÃ¢ÂÂs transplant in time for the season opener on Oct. 25, but aims to return by early November for more of the gentle sparring with the likes of Spurs coach Gregg Popovich . It would be a victory not just for him, but for all the people his fight has inspired. Ã¢ÂÂIt means that youÃ¢ÂÂre surviving and youÃ¢ÂÂre winning,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂThat youÃ¢ÂÂre knocking down obstacles and clearing hurdles that are put in front of you and youÃ¢ÂÂre doing them with flying colors. Ã¢ÂÂ On Wednesday, five colorful balloons were tied to one side of his hospital bed. Several had birthday greetings and two said: Ã¢ÂÂHappy birthday, itÃ¢ÂÂs your big day. Ã¢ÂÂ Festive, yes. But Sager was born in June. Ã¢ÂÂWhen you get stem cells, they say itÃ¢ÂÂs your new birthday,Ã¢ÂÂ Stacy explained. Ã¢ÂÂSo this is his fourth birthday. Ã¢ÂÂ Sager tried to downplay the pageantry surrounding the event, saying it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt Ã¢ÂÂa big deal. Ã¢ÂÂ That earned a sweet, yet stern, admonishment from his beloved wife.

Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt think my doctors had encountered someone like me before,Ã¢ÂÂ says the Giorgio Armani Beauty face makeup designer, 49. Ã¢ÂÂI came in and redecorated the whole room  Ã¢ÂÂ   I brought my own sheets, and I brought my own lamps. Ã¢ÂÂ And, yes, he brought his own makeup.

Ã¢ÂÂThe thought of not being tan was terribly tragic, so I learned how to use bronzer and Ã¢ÂÂ he says. He also turned his hospital room into a mini   shop, doling out lipstick and makeup tips to fellow patients. At the Cancer Moonshot Summit on Wednesday, Vice President Joe Biden urged doctors and researchers to work together by sharing data and research to make 10 yearsÃ¢ÂÂ worth of progress against cancer in five. ItÃ¢ÂÂs an approach that Quinn  Ã¢ÂÂ   who attended the summit both as a friend of Jill Biden (he regularly does her makeup) and a cancer survivor  Ã¢ÂÂ   can vouch for.

The DA had been battling a   form of colorectal cancer, another source close to Thompson said. The source did not know when exactly the diagnosis was made  Ã¢ÂÂ   but said Thompson had known for several months. Thompson revealed in a press release Tuesday that he had an Ã¢ÂÂaggressiveÃ¢ÂÂ form of the disease and had stepped down from the    running of his office. He took the job in 2014  Ã¢ÂÂ   becoming the boroughÃ¢ÂÂs first   district attorney  Ã¢ÂÂ   after defeating longtime incumbent Charles Hynes. Ã¢ÂÂWith a heavy heart, the family of Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson announced that the District Attorney passed away today after a hard fought battle with cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ his office said in a statement Sunday night. Ã¢ÂÂThompson is survived by his wife of 17 years,   Thompson, his two children, Kennedy and Kenny, his mother, father, brother and sister. The family were by his side at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital at the time of his passing. Ã¢ÂÂ Sources told The Post last week that Thompson had been out of the office since May, acting Ã¢ÂÂextremely  Ã¢ÂÂ from his Brooklyn home while undergoing treatment at the same time. Ã¢ÂÂAs a man of intense faith, I intend to fight and win the battle against this disease,Ã¢ÂÂ he said in a statement Tuesday. Ã¢ÂÂI humbly seek your sincere prayers as I confront this challenge. Ã¢ÂÂ Thompson had been a federal prosecutor with the US attorney for the Eastern District of New York before he was elected in 2013. A source told The Post that his    Chief ADA Eric Gonzalez, will be taking over until next yearÃ¢ÂÂs election. Ã¢ÂÂThe executive team and I are committed to leading the Office and carrying out DA ThompsonÃ¢ÂÂs vision and initiatives,Ã¢ÂÂ Gonzalez said in a statement Sunday night. Ã¢ÂÂHe was a giant among those seeking to reform the criminal justice system and we are all privileged to have worked under his transformative leadership these past three years.

Some scientists are   that would kill tumor cells in a patient and stop cancer from spreading. Others are looking to edit genes to enhance the immune response of the organism and eliminate cancerous growth. A federal panel approved the latter type of proposed treatment, marking the first use of CRISPR in humans.   If CRISPR sounds familiar, thatÃ¢ÂÂs because we talked about this   technology before. As   it was widely expected that   would occur in 2017, in a clinical trial supposed to treat a rare form of blindness called  . However, a federal biosafety and ethics panel on Tuesday approved a   clinical trial that would see doctors from various centers treat certain types of cancer by editing immune cells. Proposed by physicians from the University of Pennsylvania, the experiment still needs approval from the medical centers where it would be conducted, and from the FDA. The trial would focus on patients with multiple myeloma, melanoma, and sarcoma, and would be funded by the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, which was launched earlier this year by Sean Parker. The scientists plan to remove T cells (immune cells) that are in the first line of defense against foreign cells that make it inside the body, and then edit them so that they can target and kill cancerous cells. The genetic altering process of the T cells would ensure that the cells produce a Ã¢ÂÂchimeric antigen receptor,Ã¢ÂÂ or CAR, which would then bind to   protruding from tumor cells. This way, T cells would go after a specific type of cell, and only take out cancer. But for CAR to work, additional   is needed. CRISPR techniques will be used to slice out two genes in T cells. One gene is for   a molecule found on cancer cells that disable   when meeting them. The other is for endogenous TCR, T cellÃ¢ÂÂs natural receptors, as studies showed that removing the TCR results in better functioning. With   and TCR genes removed, T cells would be more efficient at fighting cancer, and they would have an increased persistence inside the human body. This new type of treatment, as exciting as it may be, also comes with some ethical side effects and conflicts of interest. For starters, we, as a species, are opening doors to something we havenÃ¢ÂÂt done before, playing with human genes. Secondly, the financial interests behind the success of such treatments are enormous, and the committee already spotted a conflict of interest in this matter that it wants to keep in check.",cancer,WeÃ¢ÂÂre trying to cure cancer by editing ourÃÂ genes,2178.0,2178.0,178.0,

Ã¢ÂÂThere is no machine that is as powerful and as specific as what our dogs can do,Ã¢ÂÂ Kuban, 29, tells The Post. Ã¢ÂÂCanines smell up to 1, 000 times more accurately than humans, and they have up to 300 million olfactory receptors as opposed to [our] 6 million.

2185,"Authentic voices and undiluted storiesBy Jonny Geller, The great thing about living through such a turbulent year as 2016 is that all bets are off in terms of what people will want to read in 2017. All we thought we knew about how people think, receive news and trust authority has changed. This must, and will, have a direct impact on what stories we want to read. Will it lead to more escapism? Or, conversely, will we seek complexity and disruption to make sense of the new order? After the first world war, modernism sprang up, and after 11 September there was an explosion of superhero franchise movies. Big moments in history are reflected back on us through our culture. Fear is always a good starting point. On television, Westworld, Humans and Mr Robot all showed up our fears of a world run by artificial intelligence or by computers out of control. Culture reflects our deepest fears, so I imagine publishing will be looking for worlds where our deepest desires, fears and impulses are released where repressed forces come to the fore. Publishing, like Hollywood, is intensely reactive. Something unlikely will become a success and then define the next wave. Dan Brown caught the wave of uncertainty post   with thrillers that linked us back to a mythical past, unlocking secrets to reveal more about who we thought we were. Gillian Flynn, Paula Hawkins and even EL James unlocked our darkest, most intimate feelings about our own domestic arrangements. I think the next big idea will be a move toward authentic voices and experiences. I think people will want undiluted stories that reflect their lives, experiences and emotions, unfiltered. I believe, too, that voices from outside the urban centres will push their way through the white,   wall of London publishing. Alongside this, there is also growing evidence of more hyperrealism, and satires being written of naturalism (similar to the wave in theatre in   century) where big issues will be explored in a recognisable setting. I am very excited by possibilities of 2017 as writers reflect the changes in narrative form. Jonny Geller is a writer, book agent and joint chief executive of Curtis Brown, the literary and talent agency. The rise of a northern Labour partyBy John Harris, A statement of the bleeding obvious, to start with. The Labour party is in a mess: apparently sliding towards the   in the polls, reeling from its poor showing in recent byelections, and riven by a split between supporters of Jeremy Corbyn and many Labour MPs. Most of all, it is spooked by what happened in the EU referendum, when most of its traditional Ã¢ÂÂcoreÃ¢ÂÂ areas voted for Brexit, highlighting both the cultural gap between the partyÃ¢ÂÂs supposed heartlands  Ã¢ÂÂ   south Wales and the north of England  Ã¢ÂÂ   and the potential threat to Labour from Ukip,   the Ã¢ÂÂpeopleÃ¢ÂÂs movementÃ¢ÂÂ that will be launched in the new year by the Brexit   Arron Banks. So far, this tension hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been reflected in any clear factional divides inside the party, but in 2017 that will change. In May, there will be a handful of elections for EnglandÃ¢ÂÂs new metropolitan mayors, including a contest in Greater Manchester. There, LabourÃ¢ÂÂs   candidate is the   leadership candidate Andy Burnham, who has decided to call time on his Westminster career and have a crack at leading a swath of the country with a population of 2. 8 million. And in the buildup to the campaign, with the tacit support of some MPs, he has come up with a new definition of what he wants to represent: Ã¢ÂÂNorthern LabourÃ¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ   which, he says, Ã¢ÂÂneeds to speak very directly to people and represent them properly in terms of the way [they] think and feelÃ¢ÂÂ. This does not take much decoding. While Corbyn and his inner circle have rejected any calls for Labour to sound tougher on immigration, Burnham has been on manoeuvres, controversially claiming that LabourÃ¢ÂÂs stance is undermining Ã¢ÂÂthe safety of our streetsÃ¢ÂÂ and the vote to leave the EU was partly about Ã¢ÂÂmore control in our immigration systemÃ¢ÂÂ. What he and his allies are aiming at is pretty clear: an offshoot of the Labour party that will try to reconnect with its lost territories, will often speak with a     voice and brazenly position itself against London. How this will sit with a cosmopolitan,   city such as Manchester remains unclear. But be in no doubt: in contrast to the Corbyn version, a different vision of LabourÃ¢ÂÂs future is about to take root 200 miles from the capital, with big political consequences.

All hail Statue of Liberty greenBy Jess   We have passed peak avocado, but the colour wheel has not spun far. The shade of 2017 will be Statue of Liberty green. The colour came into focus in September, when the New Yorker ran a lyrical piece in praise of New York CityÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂsecret, sustaining colourÃ¢ÂÂ. Soon, the colour was everywhere: in the     dress that opened the Emilia Wickstead show at London fashion week painted on the walls at the JW Anderson show. In naming the   Ã¢ÂÂgreeneryÃ¢ÂÂ its symbolic colour of 2017, Pantone championed the power of green Ã¢ÂÂto provide us with the reassurance we yearn for amid a tumultuous social and political environmentÃ¢ÂÂ. In nature, green represents hope and renewal. Our green, however, is a touch more complicated. At a time when US politics has become larger than life, breaking out of its Washington bubble to touch every part of popular culture, Statue of Liberty green is a political colour. That the copper statue had turned from brown to green within 20 years of its unveiling in 1886 means that this colour stands for change and the unstoppability of decay. So, while the symbol is everywhere  Ã¢ÂÂ   the Starbucks logo, if you ask me, although they are coy about it  Ã¢ÂÂ   it can stand for despair as well as pride. In the aftermath of NovemberÃ¢ÂÂs election, a crying Statue of Liberty, and riffs on the Planet of the Apes image of the statue   in the sand, became popular   memes on social media. Statue of Liberty green is a colour that no one planned  Ã¢ÂÂ   indeed, when the oxidisation process became evident, politicians argued over whether a paint job was called for  Ã¢ÂÂ   and that changed our landscape. It is the colour of endurance and of change. It stands for Ã¢ÂÂAmerican valuesÃ¢ÂÂ and for liberal ones. (The inscription on the pedestal, after all, includes the lines: Ã¢ÂÂGive me your tired, your poor   Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. Ã¢ÂÂ) It is a colour nobody saw coming, and one that represents conflicting views. What could be more 2017? Jess   is the GuardianÃ¢ÂÂs associate editor, fashion. Immunology brings successes and sobering newsBy Siddhartha Mukherjee, Can the human body be taught to reject cancer cells? The biggest idea in cancer this year  Ã¢ÂÂ   and perhaps the most exhilarating idea in all of medicine  Ã¢ÂÂ   was that a dormant immune system could be roused to attack cancer. It is an idea with a tortured history. In the 1890s, William Coley, a New York scientist and surgeon, had proposed injecting cancer patients with a mixture of bacterial toxins (called ColeyÃ¢ÂÂs toxins) to elicit an immune response that would attack cancer cells. But ColeyÃ¢ÂÂs initial results were hard to interpret and reproduce, and enthusiasm for the toxins waned. When I began to study immunology at Oxford in the 1990s, the field of cancer immunology was, frankly, languishing in neglect. In the late 90s, however, the discipline took a surprising turn: scientists working on the immune system (led, particularly, by the visionary immunologist James Allison) began to discover that some tumour cells expressed specific factors to inactivate the immune system or render themselves invisible to immune cells. These invisibility proteins offered an opportunity for a  : specific factors were created to inactivate these cloaking signals so that tumours would become visible again. The first such drugs were deployed against melanomas, and some patients showed durable responses, albeit with severe  . Since those initial trials, dozens of strategies to activate the immune system have been discovered, and fleets of new immunomodulatory drugs have appeared in the clinic. In another twist on the same theme, a patientÃ¢ÂÂs own immune cells were brought out of the body, manipulated with gene therapy to arm them to attack cancer cells, and reintroduced to the patient. These cells grow in the body once reintroduced, making them exemplars of a new generation of Ã¢ÂÂliving drugsÃ¢ÂÂ as Michel Sadelain, one of the pioneers of this strategy, has described them. Immunotherapy for cancer has had some sentinel successes  Ã¢ÂÂ   notably against melanoma, lung cancer, lymphomas and some leukemias. But this year also brought sobering news about unexpected   of these drugs: patients suffered inexplicable fevers or   colitis. Broader questions about efficacy and cost remain. Are these drugs going to be useful to treat only a small fraction of tumours? How much will they cost  Ã¢ÂÂ   and can that be contained? One strange effect of immunotherapy is that tumours can often swell and become larger during the early course of treatment, as immune cells infiltrate the tumours and create inflammation. For decades, the traditional metric to judge tumour responsiveness was to measure the size of the tumour  Ã¢ÂÂ   yet here the cancers seemed to grow before some of them finally responded to the therapy. Will traditional metrics of tumour responsiveness need to be   with immunotherapy? How will we understand why and when these cancers relapse  Ã¢ÂÂ   and can the immune system be retrained, over and over, to attack such perennially evolving cancers?

The rise of regional bistro cultureBy Angela Hartnett, London is not the centre of the universe any more, and what we are seeing and  Ã¢ÂÂ   I hope  Ã¢ÂÂ   will continue to see is more chefs moving out of the city and encouraging the growth of local restaurants, which can have positive effects on places and communities, and which increase access to good, affordable food. Gary Usher has done this really well with Sticky Walnut in Chester. Then, he crowdfunded the next two  Ã¢ÂÂ   Burnt Truffle on the Wirral and now Hispi in south Manchester. They are affordable little bistros that do really well. Mitch Tonks is doing it brilliantly, too. He started with The Seahorse in Dartmouth and has opened Rockfish restaurants in seaside towns. And if someone starts it off, other things happen  Ã¢ÂÂ   so thereÃ¢ÂÂs now a crab festival and a food festival in Dartmouth. It happened in Abergavenny, too, starting with the Walnut Tree. We should have affordable restaurants throughout the country. But to make a restaurant work as a business, you have to be busy on a wet Tuesday night, not just twice a week. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs hard to do, but with a bit of effort and imagination, it is possible. Angela Hartnett is a chef and   at Murano, her   restaurant in London. A new ideological spectrum By Chris Anderson, We have just ended a year of political shock. Thanks to Brexit and Trump, the comfy consensus around an   global,   world delivering bounty to all has been blown up. And the old political   spectrum has been replaced by a new spectrum. Some would sneeringly call it that of tribal v global, xenophobic v embracing, backward v forward. But there is a more generous, more productive, framing: protect v connect. From that standpoint, the mistake made by the   status quo these past years has been that in rushing towards an   connected world, we failed to protect. We let millions of people come to fear the loss of their jobs, their dreams, and the cultural norms with which they were familiar. And in the process, aided by an    social media landscape, we have become disgusted by each other. We urgently need new ways to find common ground and recreate a vision for the future worth pursuing. The jolt has been dramatic enough that it has sparked numerous ideas to help achieve this. At a minimum, itÃ¢ÂÂs going to take: Ã¢ÂÂ¾ An assault on fake news. The knowledge era needs knowledge, not clickbait. Look for new,   systems that tap into crowd wisdom, not    . Ã¢ÂÂ¾ A vision for the future of meaningful work for humans in a world filled by increasingly intelligent agents. Ã¢ÂÂ¾ Education reforms that prepare our kids to thrive in that future. Ã¢ÂÂ¾ New economic ideas, such as universal basic income. Ã¢ÂÂ¾ A new articulation of globalist thinking. It should not be driven by faceless global elites, but by individuals connecting with each other across the planet and discovering just how much we can learn from each other. Once we can start listening to each other again, there is a real discussion to be had on how we avoid sleepwalking into a future that humanity canÃ¢ÂÂt handle. We want to be amazed and delighted. But not to lose our souls in the process. LetÃ¢ÂÂs get that conversation rebooted!

An app to record abuse anonymouslyBy Helena Kennedy, I   the International Bar AssociationÃ¢ÂÂs Institute of Human Rights, which champions the rule of law and human rights around the world. Next year, we shall launch a fabulous new tool that will help in the pursuit of justice for breaches of human rights. It will make it possible, for those who witness horrifying events, to film and document them and then send them to an archive for use as evidence in trials. The phone app, for which the IBA director, Mark Ellis, found the funding, will allow people to film ghastly stuff and then send the footage directly to a repository. The time and location coordinates of filming will be attached at the time, helping to later validate the film. The immediate depositing of the film means there can be no accusations of tampering or editing. A second tap of the app will remove the film from the phone that was used to make the recording, so that the owner cannot be caught in possession of incriminating material. This development came as a result of people sending anonymous film to news outlets without authentication of place and time and proof of   the IBA has been struggling with the issue of admissibility of such evidence in a court of law. This will be an exciting development that will help prove that abuses happen all too often. Another sign of hope for 2017: people are sensibly talking about the creation of progressive alliances to combat the ghastly politics of this government. We should all see that this is the way to go.

Gene editing brings a world of extraordinary possibilitiesBy Henry Marsh, I wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be so bold as to predict any immediate big breakthroughs in medical neuroscience, but in an increasingly depressing and frightening world, I derive great pleasure, solace and a sense of wonder from the constant advance of science. One of the great things about science is that it turns up ideas and solutions that are novel, and sometimes unexpected  Ã¢ÂÂ   and I find that spiritually uplifting in a very worrying world politically, socially and environmentally. Who would have thought that ParkinsonÃ¢ÂÂs disease is probably caused by gut bacteria, or that a feathered dinosaur tail would be found in a piece of amber, preserved for 99m years? These are both recent discoveries. Then there are the extraordinary opportunities that Crispr   technology has opened and the potential for it to help us defeat a whole range of incurable illnesses. Of course, what is desperately needed is an effective cure or prevention for AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs, and a lot of people are working extremely hard on that. I think a lot of   struggle to understand that there is a deep spiritual and mystical element to science, just as there is in mathematics. A good mathematical proof is elegant, an object of aesthetic beauty that appeals to a deep level of the psyche. The idea of a division between the emotional and the rational is totally false. Doctors think with feelings rather than in terms of pure abstract, dispassionate processes we are not calculating machines. This helps because it helps fuel progress in science, which is unstoppable   and it has to be. I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to be   about it, but I think we have to be positive about the future because if weÃ¢ÂÂre not, bad things will certainly happen. If we think the future is bound to be awful, we wonÃ¢ÂÂt do anything about it. We have to think positively and act positively rather than be carried away with despair.

2186,"Cancer death rates in the United States are continuing to fall and the   survival rates of those diagnosed with the disease have risen, research shows. The Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, published on Friday, also shows a decline in incidence of cancer among men in recent years, although it remained stable among women. Death rates from 2010 to 2014 decreased for 11 of the 16 most common types of cancer in men and for 13 of the 18 most common types of cancer in women, including lung, colorectal, female breast, and prostate cancers. The authors, from the American Cancer Society, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Cancer Institute and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) suggest a decline in smoking  Ã¢ÂÂ   down more than 50% over the last 50 years  Ã¢ÂÂ   as well as improved early detection and more effective treatment helped bring about the fall. But they warn that smoking continues to pose a threat along with obesity, rates of which are at 20% or or more in every state.  NAACCR executive director Betsy Kohler said. Ã¢ÂÂThe continued drops in overall cancer death rates in the United States are welcome news, reflecting improvements in prevention, early detection, and treatment. Ã¢ÂÂBut this report also shows us that progress has been limited for several cancers, which should compel us to renew our commitment to efforts to discover new strategies for prevention, early detection, and treatment, and to apply proven interventions broadly and equitably. Ã¢ÂÂ The report, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, showed that death rates increased for cancers of the liver, pancreas, and brain in men and for liver and uterine cancer in women.  Overall, cancer death rates decreased by 1. 8% per year in men and 1. 4% a year in women.  During the period 1999 to 2013, cancer incidence rates in men fell by 2. 3% according to the study. Compared with cases diagnosed between 1975 and 1977,   survival for cancers diagnosed in 2006 to 2012 increased significantly for all manifestations of the disease bar cervical and uterine cancer.  The greatest absolute increases in survival (25% or greater) were seen in prostate and kidney cancers,   lymphoma, myeloma (bone marrow cancer) and leukaemia.  Further improvements in survival prospects are expected in the wake of recent advances in precision medicine and immunotherapy for late stage cancers. But the authors warn that the high cost of new cancer drugs  Ã¢ÂÂ   up to $10, 000 (ÃÂ£8, 000) per month  Ã¢ÂÂ   may put them out of reach even to   patients, who would still be left with a bill for around 20% of the drugÃ¢ÂÂs cost.",cancer,US cancer death rates continue to fall as 5-year survival rates rise Ã¢ÂÂ study,2186.0,2186.0,186.0,
2187,"Scientists have created the ultimate fake tan: a chemical that triggers the release of dark pigment in the skin without the need for sunbathing or a genetic predisposition for tanning. The substance would induce a tan even in fair individuals with the kind of skin that would naturally turn lobster pink rather than bronze in the sun, the scientists predicted. Ã¢ÂÂIt would not actually be a fake tan, it would be the real thing,Ã¢ÂÂ said Professor David Fisher, who led the work at Massachusetts General Hospital. Ã¢ÂÂIt would just be sunless. Ã¢ÂÂ The product, which has so far only been tested on mice and skin samples in petri dishes, would no doubt be a welcome upgrade from the telltale orange hue of a spray tan. However, the scientistsÃ¢ÂÂ central motivation was coming up with more effective protection against skin cancer. People with dark skin tones, and those who tan easily, have a far lower risk of melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer. The dark pigment, melanin, dissipates more than 99. 9% of absorbed UV rays, limiting radiation damage to cells that can be the first step towards cancer. Whether a person tans or burns in the sun is dictated by which variant they carry of a gene called MC1R. In people who tan, this gene sets off a cascade of reactions during sun exposure that results in skin cells producing melanin. Redheads could, in theory, produce the pigment in their cells  Ã¢ÂÂ   itÃ¢ÂÂs just that the chain reaction is never set in motion. The latest study, published in the journal Cell, found that a small molecule, called an SIK inhibitor, could be used to artificially switch the melanin production process on, at a point further down the chain from where the MC1R gene acts as a blockade. The researchers applied the chemical to a skin sample kept in a petri dish, and found that it darkened, with the tan lasting for days after the initial application. When ginger mice were treated, they turned almost jet black in a day or two with a strong enough dose, and were strongly protected against sunburn and skin cancer. The colour faded away over a week or so as skin cells sloughed off the surface, just as a normal tan would do, and aside from changing colour the mice did not suffer any obvious  . Fisher envisions artificial tanning being used in conjunction with normal sunscreen. Ã¢ÂÂSunscreen is extremely important there definitely is protection, but [its] efficacy in melanoma and basal cell carcinoma is surprisingly and frustratingly incomplete,Ã¢ÂÂ said Fisher. Ã¢ÂÂIf you have someone who can tan very easily, it seems to be protective above and beyond the SPF factor. Ã¢ÂÂ He added that for those who tan easily, it was not always clear whether wearing sunscreen all the time, but remaining as pale as possible, was more protective than allowing your skin to tan and relying on natural protection.  Ã¢ÂÂThe dream strategy would be to combine both,Ã¢ÂÂ Fisher added. Melanoma is the least common but most serious form of skin cancer, and is responsible for about 2, 000 deaths a year in the UK. David Adams, a geneticist at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute who has previously investigated the genetics of skin cancer, described the latest work as a significant advance. Ã¢ÂÂIf administered properly I imagine that the level of protection obtained by redheads would approximate the level of sun protection enjoyed by people with naturally tanned skin,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.  Wenyi Wei, an assistant professor at Harvard University and also a specialist in the genetics of skin cancer, said: Ã¢ÂÂIncreasing skin pigmentation as a natural barrier of UV exposure is a great idea. Ã¢ÂÂ However, he added that a potential downside of the new treatment is that the enzyme that it blocks (SIK) is itself a tumour suppressor, meaning the benefits of tanning would need to be carefully balanced with the risks of depleting this protective substance. Ã¢ÂÂI would suggest to use the SIK inhibitor only during high UV index seasons, not all year round,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. The team are now looking for a commercial partner to carry out further testing in human trials. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs obviously critical that safety and toxicity studies need to be done,Ã¢ÂÂ said Fisher. Ã¢ÂÂThis is not a toy, itÃ¢ÂÂs not a cosmetic. Ã¢ÂÂ ",cancer,Suntans for all: chemical causes any skin to tan Ã¢ÂÂ and protects against cancer,2187.0,2187.0,187.0,
2188,"Who is suggesting that the pill might protect women from cancer as well as from pregnancy? The University of Aberdeen, which has been analysing results from the Oral Contraception Study set up by the UK Royal College of General Practitioners more than 40 years ago. There have always been concerns about the mass medication of healthy women, and it has more often been the risks and harms of the pill, rather than its benefits, that have been trumpeted. So which cancers does the pill protect women from? The pill protects women from endometrial cancer  Ã¢ÂÂ   cancer of the womb  Ã¢ÂÂ   ovarian and bowel cancer. That had been established. But this, the   study, says that protection lasts up to 35 years after women stop taking it, and that there are no other cancers connected to it in the  . But doesnÃ¢ÂÂt the pill increase the risk of breast cancer? Yes, while taking it, but women on the pill are generally young and have a low risk of breast cancer, unless they have a family history. A small increase on a small risk is not much to worry about, and the increased risk disappears within five years of coming off the pill. There is also a small increased risk of cervical cancer, but that also disappears within five years of stopping. Did the study discover anything else? Yes. It found that women who take the pill are no more likely to get other sorts of cancers in later life than women who donÃ¢ÂÂt. So, in relation to cancer, researchers say the pill is very safe in the long term. What have other researchers found? Researchers at Oxford University published a major review in 2008, which showed that the pill reduced the risk of ovarian cancer by 20% for every five years that a woman took it. Those on it for 15 years cut their risk in half. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs an attractive idea, because ovarian cancer is not easily detected at an early stage, and kills   of those who get it. The Oxford scientists published in the Lancet, which ran an editorial calling for the pill to be available over the counter, as opposed to   thereby Ã¢ÂÂremoving a huge and unnecessary barrier to a potentially powerful   agentÃ¢ÂÂ. In 2015, the same team published a further review on the protection the pill provided against endometrial cancer. Protection lasted for at least 30 years, said Prof Valerie Beral. Women in their 70s were still being protected due to taking the pill earlier in life. Ã¢ÂÂIt is time to start saying that not only does it prevent pregnancy, which is why people take it, but you should know you are less likely to get cancer than women who donÃ¢ÂÂt take the pill,Ã¢ÂÂ Beral said. Why would the pill protect from cancer? Female hormones are implicated in a number of cancers. The pill contains a low dose of the hormone oestrogen, which is linked to breast and cervical cancer, so it raises these risks, as does HRT (  therapy) which is given to women dealing with menopausal symptoms. But it also contains progesterone, which is known to be protective against endometrial cancer. ArenÃ¢ÂÂt there other risks involved in taking the pill? Yes, although the NHS says they are small and that Ã¢ÂÂfor most women, the benefits of the pill outweigh the risksÃ¢ÂÂ. There is a slight increased risk of stroke because oestrogen can cause blood to clot more readily. In the leg, that can cause   thrombosis. Clots can also form in the lung or cause a stroke or heart attack. The NHS has a list of conditions that make taking the pill more risky, and says that if women have more than one of them, they should find another form of contraception. They include being over 35, being a smoker, being very overweight and having high blood pressure. So does this mean most women should take the pill for a while in their youth? If women want to use the pill to prevent pregnancy, the   effect is an added bonus, and might make it a more attractive form of contraception. But no medicine is without any side effects at all, and for a small number of people, the pill is a more risky option.",cancer,Can the contraceptive pill protect women from cancer?,2188.0,2188.0,188.0,
2189,"The singer and actor Olivia   has postponed tour dates as she revealed a second diagnosis of breast cancer. The star of Grease was scheduled to perform across the US and Canada next month, after the release of her 2016 collaborative album, Liv On.  She will be moving the dates to make way for a course of treatment, and expects to be back on the stage later in the year.   68, was born in Cambridge in England to a Welsh father and a   Jewish mother, and was raised in Melbourne after the family emigrated to Australia when she was six.  The singer recovered from breast cancer 25 years ago and has devoted herself to helping others with the disease ever since.  Last week, she cancelled planned    events for the upcoming concerts because of Ã¢ÂÂsevere back painÃ¢ÂÂ. A statement posted on Facebook said: Ã¢ÂÂOlivia   is reluctantly postponing her June US and Canadian concert tour dates.  Ã¢ÂÂThe back pain that initially caused her to postpone the first half of her concert tour has turned out to be breast cancer that has metastasised to the sacrum. Ã¢ÂÂIn addition to natural wellness therapies, Olivia will complete a short course of photon radiation therapy and is confident she will be back later in the year, better than ever, to celebrate her shows.

In an interview with the Guardian in 2008, she said: Ã¢ÂÂBeing diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992 changed my perspective for ever.  Ã¢ÂÂI had a radical modified mastectomy, which was a very emotional thing to go through, but physically it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt such a big thing for me.

2190,"Combining two existing prostate cancer therapies could extend the life of men with advanced,   prostate cancer by 37% according to a study presented at the worldÃ¢ÂÂs largest cancer conference. The new findings could change how doctors first approach treatment of prostate cancer. Ã¢ÂÂThese are the most powerful results IÃ¢ÂÂve seen from a prostate cancer trial,Ã¢ÂÂ said Nicholas James, the lead author of the abstract presented as the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs a once in a career feeling. This is one of the biggest reductions in death IÃ¢ÂÂve seen in any clinical trial for adult cancers. Ã¢ÂÂ Researchers combined standard hormone therapy with a drug called abiraterone  which is typically used only for cancer patients whose disease has stopped responding to standard hormone therapy. The research was conducted as part of the Stampede trial, an ongoing randomized trial conducted in the UK and Switzerland.  Ã¢ÂÂAbiraterone not only prolonged life, but also lowered the chance of relapse by 70% and reduced the chance of serious bone complications by 50%,Ã¢ÂÂ James said. Ã¢ÂÂBased on the magnitude of clinical benefit, we believe the upfront care for patients newly diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer should change. Ã¢ÂÂ The study looked at a group of 2, 000 men. Patients who received both abiraterone and normal hormone therapy were significantly less likely to die, compared to patients who received only hormone therapy.  Comparatively, 83% of men assigned abiraterone therapy survived versus 76% of men on standard hormone therapy. Researchers also found that patients who received both medications had slightly stronger side effects, especially cardiovascular and liver problems.  One patient who participated in the trial, Alfred Samuels, 59, was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer in January 2012. Ã¢ÂÂIt felt like my world fell apart overnight,Ã¢ÂÂ Samuels said. Ã¢ÂÂThe doctors explained that surgery wasnÃ¢ÂÂt an option for me because the cancer had spread beyond my prostate. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂAs part of the trial, I started taking abiraterone four times a day and had a hormone injection every eight weeks,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂDuring the first six months, tests showed that the treatment was working. IÃ¢ÂÂm still on the trial, which I find reassuring and, fortunately, my cancer is being managed well.

In the US, aside from skin cancer, it is the most common cancer in men.  Ã¢ÂÂThe potential benefits of giving some men abiraterone alongside hormone therapy are clearly impressive and we will be working with all relevant bodies to make sure this treatment becomes an option available for these men via the NHS,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr Iain Frame, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK.

2191,"Muslim special agents and intelligence analysts at the FBI are reporting a climate of fear inside the agency coinciding with the political ascendance of Donald Trump, the Guardian has learned. FBI officials from   countries, a minority in a predominantly white bureau, say they are subject to an organizational culture of suspicion and hostility that leadership has done little to reform. At least one decorated intelligence analyst has been fired this year after a long ordeal which began with a routine foreign visit to see his family.  His case and others in which Muslim agents have reported a workplace culture that includes   investigations predicated on their backgrounds were brought to the personal attention of the FBIÃ¢ÂÂs director, James Comey, throughout 2016.  Muslim FBI officials are alarmed that their religion and national origin is sufficient for the bureauÃ¢ÂÂs security division to treat them as a counterintelligence risk, a   obstacle that their   white FBI colleagues do not encounter.  They do not dispute a need to vet potential insider threats, but they bristle at what they consider selective enforcement and an inability for those caught in a process based on their heritage to escape suspicion. Comey has publicly described the bureauÃ¢ÂÂs overwhelming whiteness as a problem for the bureau. But in a communication acquired by the Guardian, the director nevertheless signaled that he sees merit in keeping   FBI officials under continuous scrutiny. Comey wrote to a Muslim analyst on 20 October: Ã¢ÂÂWe need folks from your background and many others if we are to be effective. Of course, we must also discharge our duty to apply appropriate scrutiny when folks have significant foreign national contacts or contacts of concern with subject [sic] of criminal,   or   cases, by virtual of [sic] family friends or travel. I see that scrutiny applied in a whole lot of contexts, and none of it is based on religion, and it never should be. Ã¢ÂÂ  He added: Ã¢ÂÂThe challenge is figuring out what scrutiny is appropriate and how to talk to the employee about it. Ã¢ÂÂ  Muslims within the FBI say that their treatment is not only unfair but frays the bureauÃ¢ÂÂs already shaky relationship with the US Muslim community. One recently ousted official believes his firing is a prelude to a wider Ã¢ÂÂpurgeÃ¢ÂÂ of Muslims within the US national security apparatus.  Ã¢ÂÂBefore they can go after Muslims in general, they have to purge the US intelligence community,Ã¢ÂÂ the analyst, Said Ã¢ÂÂSamÃ¢ÂÂ Barodi, told the Guardian. Barodi was fired on 1 February 2017 after a   investigation that stemmed from what he considered to be a strict adherence to the rules. He refused to confirm his status as a government employee after a US customs official who was following him in a foreign airport blurted it out in a public area near his departure gate.  What Barodi called, in an email to Comey, Ã¢ÂÂthe increasing hostility Middle   employees face in the FBIÃ¢ÂÂ had already been on the directorÃ¢ÂÂs radar.  On 18 May 2016, Comey held a meeting with representatives of minority groups at the FBI, including African Americans, Muslims, women, Asian Americans and LGBT employees. He heard what Barodi called the Ã¢ÂÂstruggle storiesÃ¢ÂÂ of nine different Muslim employees who have faced what they consider discrimination.  Among those stories, which included BarodiÃ¢ÂÂs, were accounts of white FBI officials who exhibited blatant Islamophobia, including those who blamed terrorism on Islam and suspected their Muslim colleagues of adherence to sharia law over the US constitution. Comey was urged to set limits on a controversial program that keeps   officials under   investigation by the   security division. FBI employees at the meeting declined cooperation for this story, and the FBI told the Guardian it could not comment on a directorÃ¢ÂÂs internal meeting.  Ã¢ÂÂThe FBI values diversity within our employees and is committed to fostering diversity and inclusion,Ã¢ÂÂ the FBI said in a statement to the Guardian.  Ã¢ÂÂDiversity is an FBI core value and a priority for Director Comey. The FBI has internal processes available for employees to report incidents if they feel discriminated against based upon ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or gender. But FBI veterans said they see few signs that Comey is addressing the issue. A program under discussion at the meeting, known as   risk management, or Parm, has been the subject of public and media scrutiny for years. It resembles what Barodi called a Ã¢ÂÂ  streetÃ¢ÂÂ: a pathway for FBI employees of foreign backgrounds to come under suspicion and never escape it.  An FBI employeeÃ¢ÂÂs foreign background is sufficient to open a Parm investigation, the Guardian has learned, if the employee is from one of 27 countries or territories, 15 of which are in the Middle East or are  . It includes the seven countries initially on TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs travel ban: Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Iran and Yemen.  Visiting family in those countries is considered prima facie suspicious under Parm, even if those relatives are not themselves suspected of posing a danger. The Guardian has learned that nearly 1, 000 FBI officials are involved in various stages of Parm investigations, roughly 1 in 36 of all FBI employees. Comey has publicly espoused diversity and said the FBI faced a Ã¢ÂÂcrisisÃ¢ÂÂ after recent hiring statistics revealed the bureauÃ¢ÂÂs special agents to be 83% white. Several minority agents and analysts point to a compounded distorting effect emerging from such racial uniformity.  While the   at the FBI are objects of suspicion, white staff have historically posed the demonstrated security risks. The biggest counterintelligence failure in FBI history came from Robert Hanssen, a white FBI agent who fed internal secrets to Russia for over 20 years. Ã¢ÂÂRobert Hanssen, no one knew he was spying [inside] the FBI. Yeah, because youÃ¢ÂÂre not looking at your own color, youÃ¢ÂÂre always looking at the wrong color,Ã¢ÂÂ said Gamal   who retired from the FBI in 2015 after 22 years as a special agent. A Muslim, he too was caught in ParmÃ¢ÂÂs dragnets. Ã¢ÂÂRobert Hanssen was a white American who went to the same church as the director of the FBI, so everybody thought that heÃ¢ÂÂs a fantastic guy. Ã¢ÂÂ   said the FBI initially Ã¢ÂÂneededÃ¢ÂÂ Parm in the hectic months after  . Realizing its shortfall in understanding the Middle East and South Asia, the FBI was rapidly hiring linguists and conducting background checks later. But once the urgency subsided, the program ultimately expanded its reach rather than contracting it. Soon, longtime translators were under examination then the intelligence analysts then the new special agents then all agents.  With the expansion in ParmÃ¢ÂÂs reach came an expansion in its goals.  Ã¢ÂÂIn 2012, I was with the bureau for 19 years, and they added me on that list,Ã¢ÂÂ   said. He had intended to give a deposition, and believes the move was intended to scare him off.  An attorney for the FBIÃ¢ÂÂs office of general counsel told   that the bureau would Ã¢ÂÂrather you not testifyÃ¢ÂÂ in a federal case alleging discrimination against the bureau,   said. Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs when they put me on the Parm program, as a punishment for testifying in court for someone who was suing the FBI,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Three days before  Ã¢ÂÂs scheduled deposition, he received a notice informing him of his Parm investigation. Ã¢ÂÂSome people are never told they are included,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.  Ultimately,   testified anyway.  Barodi and others do not see Parm cases emerging at random. Ã¢ÂÂThe only people weÃ¢ÂÂve seen affected by the Parm program are Middle Easterners,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. The FBI, which declined comment on the number of FBI employees under Parm suspicion, said Ã¢ÂÂreligion is not a factorÃ¢ÂÂ in the program. Ã¢ÂÂThe   Risk Management (Parm) Program is a tool used to mitigate security concerns to ensure individuals may gain or maintain required eligibility for access to national security information. There are multiple factors that are reviewed in determining the need, if any, for a Parm. Reasons for a Parm may include concerns that an individual may be vulnerable or susceptible to coercion due to certain foreign contacts or financial situations. Ã¢ÂÂ Over the past 18 months, as Donald Trump went from fringe candidate to GOP presidential nominee to president of the United States, the climate within the FBI became less hospitable to Muslims, according to current and former FBI officials. An FBI agent told the Guardian in 2016 that sympathy for TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs positions had turned the bureau into Ã¢ÂÂTrumplandÃ¢ÂÂ. Barodi will not say what he did for the FBI beyond specifying that he worked on cybersecurity issues. He spent 2016 caught in a web of suspicion after an incident in Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. It ultimately cost him his career. In January 2016, Barodi visited his family in Paris, Brussels and Morocco. The FBI was aware of his travel plans in keeping with internal regulations, Barodi uploaded his itinerary to an electronic tracking system in August 2015. But the FBI was not the only agency to learn of them.  On 30 January 2016, a plainclothes officer with the Department of Homeland Security approached Barodi in the de Gaulle terminal and asked if he was boarding a specific flight. Barodi dodged the stranger, who persisted, to the point of addressing Barodi by his last name and saying, in earshot of any travelers nearby, that he knew Barodi worked for the FBI. Barodi, in keeping with his counterintelligence training, confirmed nothing. He initially thought the officer, who briefly produced a government credential, was a foreign agent attempting to recruit him as a spy. The officer, persisting, said he knew Barodi had come to de Gaulle from Morocco and wanted to ask him a few questions. Barodi refused and said the officer was racially profiling him.  Fatefully, Barodi took three photos on his cellphone of the officer. Barodi asked if the officer thought he lacked constitutional protections while overseas, and received an answer: yes. Before Barodi boarded his flight, the officer put his hand to BarodiÃ¢ÂÂs chest and demanded Ã¢ÂÂprofessional courtesyÃ¢ÂÂ. Barodi demanded the officerÃ¢ÂÂs name and badge number, receiving no more than a   number.  While standing in line to board his flight, Barodi texted his wife, Julia, and informed her that he was likely to be detained. He asked her to alert the FBI. On the plane, Barodi remembers, he was full of questions. How did the DHS officer know his travel schedule? How did he know Barodi worked for the FBI? Why did he publicly identify Barodi as an FBI agent? Barodi was certain only of two things: he was going to be detained when he attempted to clear customs at WashingtonÃ¢ÂÂs Dulles airport and it would mark the end of his FBI career.  By the time he touched down, Barodi also texted his supervisor, George, what was happening: Ã¢ÂÂI was harassed by a HSA [Homeland Security agent] when I tried to board in Paris. He knew who I was and that I worked for the FBI. Do you know anything about this?Ã¢ÂÂ (The FBI has asked the Guardian to withhold the supervisorÃ¢ÂÂs identity.) As he predicted, Barodi spent the next several hours in secondary screening. Customs agents informed him that they were Ã¢ÂÂaware of an incidentÃ¢ÂÂ in Paris and wanted to discuss it. When Barodi asked if the man he encountered in Paris was indeed an employee of DHS, he said he received an evasive answer about the department having a Ã¢ÂÂlimited number of personnel in a limited number of locationsÃ¢ÂÂ. Without acknowledging the agent at de Gaulle, the customs officials knew Barodi had taken photos of his airport interlocutor and wanted to know if he would delete them. Barodi said he took them for his protection and would delete them after a debriefing for his boss. It was a delicate reference: Barodi feared that if he revealed his FBI employment, he might later find himself accused of trying to curry favor with customs. Barodi declined to unlock his phone out of fear that customs would search through it, but gave the agents his locked phone upon request.  As the hours wore on, it became harder for Barodi to know what he was supposed to have done wrong. When he exercised his right not to answer questions, customs informed him that they considered his reluctance to be suspicious. They told him they wanted the pictures on his phone. And they told Barodi that they wanted to ask him about his travel to Morocco. But the more Barodi tried to figure out what the specific issue was, the more confused he became.  Ã¢ÂÂI did not answer probing questions about what I was doing in Morocco as I felt I was being framed as a CT [counterterrorism] subject on my ethnicity, national origin and religious background and my knowledge of CBPA [Customs and Border Patrol agents] harassment of Americans of the Muslim faith or those of Arab descent. I told CBPA I had no ill intention with the photos as those were for my safety and intended for FBI security,Ã¢ÂÂ Barodi later explained in a sworn statement for the FBI.  According to Barodi, after about two and a half hours, customs involved the FBI, sending special agent Mark Hess and a customs official, Gregory Derricote, who was deputized as a member of the   joint terrorism taskforce. All of a sudden, it seemed to Barodi, an FBI intelligence analyst was under suspicion for a   issue. Hess began to reference the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, weeks before Barodi set foot in France, and in San Bernardino, California, where he had not even been.  Ã¢ÂÂThis is bullshit. IÃ¢ÂÂm not a terrorist,Ã¢ÂÂ Barodi said.  Derricote said they had to ask because of Ã¢ÂÂthe environment and the terrorist attacks in Paris and San BernardinoÃ¢ÂÂ. Barodi was incensed, all the while noting those attacks had nothing to do with any concern, cited by customs, about the Morocco leg of his trip. Hess shifted the issue to the pictures Barodi had of the agent. The only way to resolve the issue so that Barodi could leave, Hess told him, was to Ã¢ÂÂdelete the picturesÃ¢ÂÂ. Derricote gave Barodi his phone. Barodi turned it on, unlocked it and deleted the photos while they watched.  Customs went through BarodiÃ¢ÂÂs luggage and handed him back his bags and wallet. He was free to go after four hours. Ã¢ÂÂYou made yourself look suspicious,Ã¢ÂÂ a customs officer responsible for Dulles airport, Lionel Gruillon, told him. Barodi tried to reach George, his FBI supervisor, several times. As he drove home with his wife from Dulles, George texted back: Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂll talk tomorrow. Ã¢ÂÂ When Barodi reached him the next day, Sunday, George told him they would deal with it at the Washington field office on Monday morning.  It turned out that George had already been in contact with customs before BarodiÃ¢ÂÂs plane touched down. According to an email Barodi later obtained, George told a supervisory agent that George had spoken with a customs watch commander at de Gaulle, John Whittaker, who claimed Barodi was Ã¢ÂÂidentified by his travel pattern, which included visits to several countries of counterterrorism interestÃ¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ   all of which George had known for months that Barodi would visit. George wrote: Ã¢ÂÂI apologized to Mr Whittaker on behalf of IA [intelligence analyst] Barodi, myself, and the FBI and that however the CBP officer had approached him, IA Barodi did not display the professional attitude one expects of an FBI employee. Ã¢ÂÂ Now, it seemed, the issue was BarodiÃ¢ÂÂs sense of interagency decorum.  At work on Monday, GeorgeÃ¢ÂÂs supervisor informed Barodi that she was displeased with his behavior at de Gaulle. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ in the field office, the supervisor said, would be looking into the matter, and told Barodi to prepare a statement. She was referring him to the office of professional responsibility for disciplinary action. (The FBI asked the Guardian to withhold the identity of the supervisor.) There was no discussion of BarodiÃ¢ÂÂs decision to protect his FBI affiliation in a foreign airport, let alone his concern that he was profiled. By 23 February, Barodi met with security agents at the field office who also rejected the profiling claim out of hand it might have been Ã¢ÂÂMorocco dayÃ¢ÂÂ one said, implying that Barodi had the misfortune of flying on a day when CBP was checking travelers from Morocco. The agents showed Barodi copies of his Moroccan bank statement  Ã¢ÂÂ   which he kept, with the FBIÃ¢ÂÂs knowledge, to pay his Moroccan parentsÃ¢ÂÂ mortgage  Ã¢ÂÂ   and his old Moroccan ID, asking him why he never renounced his Moroccan citizenship. No one at the FBI had ever instructed him to, he said, but now, alarmed at what seemed to be an escalating situation, he reiterated his willingness to do so. It made little difference. Once their interview was done, the security agents revoked BarodiÃ¢ÂÂs access to secret compartmentalized information  Ã¢ÂÂ   effectively, his security clearance was busted down to a level below what he needed to do his job. Barodi couldnÃ¢ÂÂt reenter his work space. In front of his colleagues, the security agents boxed up his work materials and the next day moved him to a different floor of the building. Barodi, a cybersecurity analyst, was reassigned to a healthcare fraud squad.  Barodi was humiliated. Appraising how he saw his status, he said: Ã¢ÂÂYou look like a terrorist. Your credibility is shot. Ã¢ÂÂ He was left in a holding pattern for months. An attempt to seek redress through the equal opportunity office was rejected. He wrote to his senator, Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine, without result. On 7 September, the office of professional responsibility wrote to Barodi to inform him that it was recommending him for dismissal: he had, in Ã¢ÂÂtwo busy international airports . .. refused to cooperateÃ¢ÂÂ with customs officials, and had displayed a Ã¢ÂÂlack of candorÃ¢ÂÂ by refusing to answer questions. The FBI even referred to BarodiÃ¢ÂÂs letter with Kaine and accused Barodi of overstating his case to the senator: Ã¢ÂÂYour allegations against this [customs] agent in [Paris] became even more amplified, as you asserted that you had been Ã¢ÂÂstalked,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂharassedÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂassaulted. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ  Weeks later, on 30 September, Barodi received what would be his final performance review. Ã¢ÂÂIA Barodi received one Outstanding ratings, four Excellent ratings, and two Successful ratings for an overall rating of Excellent,Ã¢ÂÂ it reads. Both George and GeorgeÃ¢ÂÂs supervisor signed it.  On 13 October, Barodi wrote to Comey about Ã¢ÂÂthe increasing hostility Middle   employees face in the FBI   Ã¢ÂÂ¦     I wish to stress that none of us would have been subject of an   investigation had we not possessed the    origin backgrounds we have. We feel the FBI resents needing us and we are not set up to succeed or even be. Ã¢ÂÂ  Comey responded on 20 October. Ã¢ÂÂLetÃ¢ÂÂs imagine we have an employee whose family lives in Russia and who travels to Russia to visit them every year. Do you agree it makes sense to have some additional layer of scrutiny in that situation? I suspect you do. To me, the issue is how we do it and how respectfully and fully we answer the employeeÃ¢ÂÂs questions about why we are scrutinizing them,Ã¢ÂÂ the director wrote, thanking Barodi Ã¢ÂÂfor your service to the FBI and the nationÃ¢ÂÂ. Whether the director knew it or not, the email exchange was not his first time encountering Barodi. Comey signed an Ã¢ÂÂ   awardÃ¢ÂÂ for Barodi on 1 July 2015 for aiding a counterintelligence investigation. It is one of several commendations Barodi had earned at the FBI another, in 2011, was for helping the bureau understand the Arab spring uprisings.  During the early weeks of the Trump administration, career civil servants have come under fire as disloyal holdovers from Barack ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs administration. A Muslim nonpolitical appointee on the national security council, Rumana Ahmed, quit in protest of TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs Muslim ban. Others have been pushed out. The new administration abruptly fired the senior career leadership at the Department of State in late January. Intelligence officials at the Department of Homeland Security were castigated by DHSÃ¢ÂÂs own press shop over an analysis that contradicted the Muslim ban. Trump himself has pointed a finger, over Twitter, at FBI and NSA officials for leaking material highlighting ties between senior Trump aides and Russia.   does not believe the FBI is purging Muslims as a deliberate strategy. For him, the bureau leadership is blind to the fears of   officials, particularly Muslims, who cannot seem to escape internal suspicion. Ã¢ÂÂComey, in my opinion, heÃ¢ÂÂs a politician. He wants to ride the wave and look good. That was my opinion then, and what he did with Hillary, the Hillary investigation, sealed the deal. He just cares about how he looks,Ã¢ÂÂ said   now a private investigator in Houston. He continued: Ã¢ÂÂThey harass the Muslims within the bureau, and then they beg for help within the Muslim community. How hypocritical is this? At the same time they put me in the Parm program, they were asking me to recruit people for them. Ã¢ÂÂ On 1 February, Barodi showed up to the Manassas, Virginia, satellite location of the FBI Washington field office. It was his last day. His personal effects from work were in a backpack. His work materials had been boxed up. Around 3pm on a crisp sunny day, a security officer badged his car out of the complexÃ¢ÂÂs garage and wished Barodi luck.  Barodi is now pursuing a wrongful termination claim within the FBI bureaucracy, and a potential lawsuit challenging the discrimination he faced. Accordingly, the FBI declined comment on BarodiÃ¢ÂÂs case. Ã¢ÂÂI would not advise anyone to work for the FBI under these circumstances. Fuck, stay away. It is not worth it. It is cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ Barodi said. Ã¢ÂÂMuslim employees in federal law enforcement,Ã¢ÂÂ he continued, Ã¢ÂÂwe are the target.

2193,"Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre sick of being sick, weÃ¢ÂÂre tired of being tired,Ã¢ÂÂ said Pastor Harry Joseph of Mount Triumph Baptist church, which serves this sleepy riverside town of about 1, 000 residents, mostly poor and African American. Once a bucolic village of pasturelands and sugarcane fields on the banks of the Mississippi, St James, Louisiana, is now a densely packed industrial zone in the heart of LouisianaÃ¢ÂÂs petrochemical corridor, commonly referred to as Cancer Alley. ItÃ¢ÂÂs only anecdotal evidence of what life is like here, but Joseph says he has buried five residents in the past six months, all victims of cancer. After a $1. 9bn methanol plant recently broke ground and with another $1. 3bn methanol plant and a controversial new oil pipeline planned for the area, JosephÃ¢ÂÂs   church has become a staging ground for an environmental justice fight  Ã¢ÂÂ   albeit one with tempered hopes under Donald Trump, even before he served notice on the Paris accord on climate change last week, Joseph has emerged as the de facto leader of a group of local residents demanding residential buyouts  Ã¢ÂÂ   for those who say they have had enough and struggle to sell their homes  Ã¢ÂÂ   and pressuring state and federal agencies to halt further development. With regulation that critics say is loose and   even by Louisiana standards, St James offers a glimpse into the type of unchecked development that Trump has hailed as a precondition for American jobs and economic growth.  The townÃ¢ÂÂs location on the Mississippi river and accessibility to cheap oil and gas feedstock make St James what Louisiana Economic Development, a state agency, described to the Guardian as an Ã¢ÂÂidealÃ¢ÂÂ site for large industrial projects. About 10 years ago, the town was rezoned from residential to industrial, paving the way for the highly concentrated development seen today. Fifteen large industrial sites  Ã¢ÂÂ   mainly oil storage facilities, pipelines and petrochemical plants  Ã¢ÂÂ   now fill the   stretch of road that defines the town of St James, also known as the fifth ward of St James parish. Yet residents here say theyÃ¢ÂÂve seen little economic benefit  Ã¢ÂÂ   either in jobs or tax revenues  Ã¢ÂÂ   from the industry that has taken over the town. Instead, they say, theyÃ¢ÂÂve been saddled with a myriad of health issues, medical bills and environmental degradation. Ã¢ÂÂThey put [the plants] here and the other parishes are the ones that get the jobs,Ã¢ÂÂ claimed Joseph. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre like the lamb that was sacrificed. Ã¢ÂÂ The rise of the oil and petrochemical industry at their doorstep has thrust residents into a financial trap. They canÃ¢ÂÂt afford to leave without selling their houses, but the predominance of industrial plants and pipelines has slashed home values and scared off buyers. Many here see only one ticket out: a residential buyout by industrial companies operating here. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre going to make sure they get compensated right and they are able to move on with their life,Ã¢ÂÂ said Joseph of the significant population here that wants to leave, many of them elderly. Ã¢ÂÂThey have dedicated themselves to St James. And right now they are saying, Ã¢ÂÂI can live in St James, but I canÃ¢ÂÂt die in St James. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Geraldine Mayho is one of those residents determined not to die in St James. A large suitcase and stack of boxes fill one corner of her modest home, which is bordered on both sides by the huge cylindrical oil storage tanks that dominate the local landscape. She walks through the house to point out the crooked doorways and window frames and cracked walls  Ã¢ÂÂ   an effect of the near constant industrial activity at nearby loading docks that has shifted the house foundation. She says she canÃ¢ÂÂt afford to rent an apartment on her monthly pension of about $700 from her days as a janitor at the local high school. Her best option is to move in with her grandchildren in Mobile, Alabama, until someone  Ã¢ÂÂ   local industry, she hopes  Ã¢ÂÂ  compensates her for her home. Ã¢ÂÂWhether or not they buy me out, IÃ¢ÂÂve got to get out of here,Ã¢ÂÂ said Mayho. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm so tired of being sick. Ã¢ÂÂ She says that since moving here in 1965, when the area was still mostly agricultural, she has suffered a range of ailments, from headaches to stomachaches and heart problems, that doctors could never fully explain. But several years ago, she says one doctor gave her a letter stating her conditions were the result of exposure to Ã¢ÂÂtoxic substancesÃ¢ÂÂ. Her familyÃ¢ÂÂs health, too, has been shaped by the townÃ¢ÂÂs air pollution. She rattles off a list of six female relatives, all residents, recently diagnosed with or deceased from breast cancer. One son has had a persistent cough another is infertile. Her daughter died in her 30s, but she says doctors couldnÃ¢ÂÂt identify the exact cause. Ã¢ÂÂShe was sick like I was sick,Ã¢ÂÂ Mayho said. Asked if she thought her daughterÃ¢ÂÂs death had been caused by industrial pollution, she fought back tears: Ã¢ÂÂI know it was. Ã¢ÂÂ The Louisiana Tumor Registry, a state cancer tracker, only releases data on a regional level, so localized cancer rates are hard to come by. But many residents who speak to the Guardian seem to have some ailment or an affected family member, from cancer to asthma to multiple sclerosis and skin conditions, and they all trace it back to the air pollution from the chemical plants that surround them. However, according to the Louisiana department of environmental quality (LDEQ) the state regulator, emissions from the collection of plants that surround St James are compliant with state and federal regulations. LDEQ representatives point to improvements in air quality over the years as a sign of regulatory success. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs very clear that air quality has greatly improved over time,Ã¢ÂÂ Bryan Johnston, who works in the air permits division of the LDEQ, said. Ã¢ÂÂOver the last 20 years and even more recently, in just the last several years, there has been dramatic declines in air emissions in St James parish. Ã¢ÂÂ  Johnston said the LDEQ would release its   emissions data for St James with its forthcoming final permitting decision for the YCI plant. Publicly available EPA data is inconclusive and often averaged across the entire county. One data set from the EPAÃ¢ÂÂs Toxic Release Inventory for Ã¢ÂÂcore chemicalsÃ¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ   which does not include chemicals added since 1988  Ã¢ÂÂ   shows wide    fluctuations in total air emissions for St James Parish since the late 1980s. In 2015, total core chemicals emissions were 501, 150lb, scarcely below the 516, 088 reported in 1988.  But few here would agree with JohnstonÃ¢ÂÂs assessment. Some say they simply stopped reporting strong chemical smells that regularly waft across the town because, they say, local authorities donÃ¢ÂÂt do anything.  Ã¢ÂÂBack in the day, you knew when you smelled it,Ã¢ÂÂ said Brettaiene Celestin, 66, describing unusual emissions events. She grew up in the area and lives alone in a small trailer that borders an industrial railroad and oil storage terminals. Ã¢ÂÂBut now, itÃ¢ÂÂs like a part of your life. Ã¢ÂÂ Local people say wild lemon and orange trees have stopped bearing fruit, there are no more butterflies or crickets, and new flooding issues have plagued the town since their industrial neighbors began to use the agricultural ditches that once let rainwater flow through for plant drainage use. Ã¢ÂÂ[We feel] totally unprotected, forgotten about,Ã¢ÂÂ added Eve Butler, 60, a resident and local advocate. Despite the constant refrain from politicians and companies touting job opportunities, few here of working age are employed in the local oil and petrochemical plants. Any boom in construction jobs is brief and the far fewer permanent jobs tend to go to contractors outside the parish or the state. There are some local residents employed by the nearby plants, but, according to residents, many people work outside of the town or parish, mainly in professional services positions or at other industrial plants.  Ã¢ÂÂOur quality of life has deteriorated and nobody takes responsibility for that. Because youÃ¢ÂÂre told: itÃ¢ÂÂs private industry, itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be good for the community. But the community has not benefitted,Ã¢ÂÂ said Butler. Ã¢ÂÂWe are kind of, like, collateral damage. Ã¢ÂÂ With two new methanol plants, plus the terminus of the Bayou Bridge pipeline  Ã¢ÂÂ   which would carry crude oil from the controversial Dakota Access pipeline  Ã¢ÂÂ   planned for the area, local and state activists see an opportunity to fight back. But TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs dual aims of handcuffing the EPA with budget cuts while also accelerating industrial deregulation have tempered hopes for change here. In January, Yuhuang Chemical Inc (YCI) a subsidiary of ChinaÃ¢ÂÂs Shandong Yuhuang Chemical Co, broke ground on the first phase of its $1. 9bn methanol plant. When the project was announced in 2014, it was the largest greenfield investment by a Chinese firm in the US. The plant will eventually produce 3m metric tons of methanol a year,  % of which could be shipped abroad, according to YCIÃ¢ÂÂs general counsel, Jerry Jones. South Louisiana MethanolÃ¢ÂÂs (SLM) $1. 3bn plant, to produce 5, 300 metric tons a day, is planned nearby. The Bayou Bridge pipeline, another project drawing the ire of environmentalists, would, once built, cross 163 miles of delicate Louisiana wetlands, including eight watersheds, and terminate at oil storage terminals in St James. Both projects are expected to receive permits to move forward soon. In this largely African American town that grew out of former slave plantations, people are concerned with a certain kind of environmental injustice. Two environmental groups have pushed the EPA to declare civil rights violations because the cumulative air pollution of existing and new plants disproportionately impacts a community of color. Ã¢ÂÂWe felt it was a perfect example of environmental injustices happening at a community that has already got too much to be there,Ã¢ÂÂ said Darryl   environmental justice organizer at the Sierra Club, which, along with the local    Louisiana Environmental Action Network, filed the EPA petitions against YCI and SLM. The EPA did not respond to the SLM petition, but in August, the agency agreed with some parts of the groupÃ¢ÂÂs petition addressing the YCI plant and kicked the question of the air emissions permit back to LDEQ. The state agency floated a revised permit for public comment late last year the same environmental groups again petitioned in March, saying the new version still failed to comply with Clean Air Act standards. But another EPA ruling in their favor is an unlikely prospect, the advocacy group fears, as the agency prepares for major cuts under Trump, including the elimination of its environmental justice program. The LDEQ says it expects to issue final approval for the new emissions permit this month. For environmentalists in Louisiana, where the LDEQ is widely viewed as an accessory of industrial corporations, TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs attempts to unravel the EPA are especially worrying. Ã¢ÂÂ[LDEQ] feels that itÃ¢ÂÂs their goal to issue permits   Ã¢ÂÂ¦     not to protect citizens of Louisiana, not to protect the environment,Ã¢ÂÂ said  . He says that while the EPAÃ¢ÂÂs Region 6 office, which covers Louisiana, has been among the weakest on enforcement, the agency has still stepped in at times when the state has not. One of the first environmental justice cases tried by the EPA put a stop to a proposed PVC plant in 1998 in Convent, Louisiana, directly across the river from St James. Johnston, of the LDEQ, strongly rejected claims the office served as a rubber stamp for industry, citing what he said were   air quality improvements in the state.  Louisiana has developed an outsized role in the countryÃ¢ÂÂs energy and petrochemical industry, thanks in part to generous tax breaks that are largely borne at the local level. The stateÃ¢ÂÂs Industrial Tax Exemption Program (ITEP) which dates back to the 1930s, offers a   local property tax exemption for industrial developers. Between 2008 and 2015, the state estimates it lost nearly $10bn in revenue under the ITEP. It expects to forego an additional $7bn from 2016 to 2020. St James has been one of the top parishes for the ITEP over the past decade, giving out an average of $36. 5m in tax breaks every year. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs compared to a total of $61. 8m in taxes actually collected in the parish in 2015. As the latest   company to enter the town, in April, YCI hosted a crawfish boil with company representatives on hand to answer questions about the plant. The event turned contentious, as Joseph and a group of upset citizens peppered the company president and CEO, Charlie Yao, with questions, unsatisfied with his assertion that the plant would be built to the highest environmental and safety standards. Ã¢ÂÂNo one can get 100% support of anything you do,Ã¢ÂÂ Yao told the Guardian. Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs my mission, to work with people. Ã¢ÂÂ He said the meeting was the start of a community engagement process that would include job and vendor fairs this summer. The company plans to hire   people on a permanent basis once the first phase of the plant comes online, by October of 2019.  Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre going to try to do the best we can to be a good community neighbor,Ã¢ÂÂ Jones, YCIÃ¢ÂÂs general counsel, told the Guardian. When asked if the company would participate in any residential buyouts, Jones said: Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt feel itÃ¢ÂÂs appropriate [for YCI] to bear the burden of solving that problem for the community. If the industrial complex wants to figure out a way to solve that problem, then we will be a part of that. Ã¢ÂÂ  Still, many here remain skeptical. Ã¢ÂÂWhat you are looking at is a dying community,Ã¢ÂÂ said Butler. Ã¢ÂÂNot because of the residents, but because of the way industry is allowed to come in. And they call it progress. Ã¢ÂÂ Years ago, she encouraged her children, who grew up in St James, to move out of Louisiana because of the health risks. Within the next ten years or so, she expects the entire town will be nothing but plants and pipelines. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂve got a president now that looks at money and not people,Ã¢ÂÂ said Joseph. Ã¢ÂÂOur fight is just beginning, because if itÃ¢ÂÂs not going to be this [plant] itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be another one. Ã¢ÂÂ Nevertheless, he says his hope is that public pressure on YCI will force the company  Ã¢ÂÂ   and others looking at St James  Ã¢ÂÂ   to eventually pull out. Ã¢ÂÂWe might not win all the battles,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂBut I think we are going to win the war.

During a brief hearing at the Brooklyn federal court, GuzmÃÂ¡n pleaded not guilty to charges that he lead a vast and murderous criminal operation that distributed 200 tons of cocaine for sale on American streets. Wearing a dark blue prison smock and trousers, blue tennis shoes and a light brown   GuzmÃÂ¡n shuffled into court with his hands behind his back looking subdued.  Speaking quietly through a translator, he told judge James Orenstein that he understood the charges against him and the rights he had as a defendant.  Ã¢ÂÂSi, seÃÂ±or,Ã¢ÂÂ he repeated, in reply to OrensteinÃ¢ÂÂs questions.  He declined to apply for bail.  Unveiling a   indictment against GuzmÃÂ¡n at a press conference on Friday morning, Robert Capers, the US attorney for the eastern district of New York, said GuzmÃÂ¡n would be forced to answer for a Ã¢ÂÂlife of crime, violence, death and destructionÃ¢ÂÂ as the head of the Sinaloa cartel. Ã¢ÂÂGuzmÃÂ¡nÃ¢ÂÂs story is not one of a   or a Robin Hood, or an escape artist,Ã¢ÂÂ said Capers, referring to GuzmÃÂ¡nÃ¢ÂÂs record of twice fleeing Mexican prisons. Instead, said Capers, Ã¢ÂÂGuzmÃÂ¡nÃ¢ÂÂs rise was akin to that of a small cancerous tumour that metastasized into a   scourgeÃ¢ÂÂ. Capers said that in addition to decades of drug trafficking, GuzmÃÂ¡n had maintained an army of hitmen to commit murders in defence of his network, amassed a   arsenal of weapons, and personally carried a     rifle and   handgun. Standing alongside 20 officials from agencies including the FBI, NYPD, the Department of Homeland Security and the Drug Enforcement Administration, Capers said his announcement was the culmination of more than a decade of investigative work by multiple American authorities. GuzmÃÂ¡n was flown into the US on a Mexican law enforcement plane late on Thursday. Officials said that after landing at MacArthur airport on Long Island, he was driven in a   motorcade to the metropolitan correction center in Manhattan, before being moved to Brooklyn at 7am on Friday. Special agent Angel Melendez, of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said that for GuzmÃÂ¡n Ã¢ÂÂthe realisation began to kick in that he was about to face American justiceÃ¢ÂÂ upon his transfer to the country, which several officials said had taken the US government by surprise on Thursday. Ã¢ÂÂAs he deplaned, the most notorious criminal of modern times, as you looked into his eyes you could see the surprise, you could see the shock, and to a certain extent you could see the fear,Ã¢ÂÂ said Melendez. Amid speculation that GuzmÃÂ¡nÃ¢ÂÂs extradition was a parting gift from Mexico to the Obama administration, or even an early peace offering to incoming US president Donald Trump, Capers declined to comment on whether the timing had political significance. Officials also would not comment on where GuzmÃÂ¡n would be detained and on extra precautions being taken to guard the capo, who twice absconded from   prisons in Mexico  Ã¢ÂÂ   most recently through a sophisticated underground passageway which led from his cell bathroom.  Melendez said to laughter that Ã¢ÂÂno tunnel will be built leading to his bathroomÃ¢ÂÂ. Ã¢ÂÂWhat occurred in other countries will not occur here,Ã¢ÂÂ said Capers. Following his second escape in 2015, GuzmÃÂ¡n was recaptured in a seedy motel in the city of Los Mochis after federal agents trailed the actor Sean Penn to a clandestine meeting with the fugitive kingpin. A   memo filed to court by US authorities on Friday said that prosecutors plan to use at trial Ã¢ÂÂa large coterie of cooperating witnessesÃ¢ÂÂ including dozens of people who claim to have had    dealings with GuzmÃÂ¡n and   drug distributors who were supplied by the Sinaloa cartel. One witness is expected to testify about GuzmÃÂ¡nÃ¢ÂÂs use of assassins against his rivals, Ã¢ÂÂincluding his use of a house specially outfitted for murdering victimsÃ¢ÂÂ the court filing said. Ã¢ÂÂThe house had plastic sheets over the walls to catch spouting blood and a drain in the floor to facilitate the draining of blood. Ã¢ÂÂ Other witnesses are said to be prepared to testify about Ã¢ÂÂspecific murders carried out under GuzmÃÂ¡nÃ¢ÂÂs ordersÃ¢ÂÂ including the killing of the cocaine trafficker Julio BeltrÃÂ¡n, as well as GuzmÃÂ¡nÃ¢ÂÂs payment of bribes to Mexican politicians and law enforcement officials. Physical evidence, such as ledgers from Colombian drug cartel bosses detailing agreements with GuzmÃÂ¡n, would also be used against him, according to the memo, along with intercepted electronic surveillance of GuzmÃÂ¡n and Ã¢ÂÂnumerous physical surveillancesÃ¢ÂÂ in the US and other countries. Authorities requested that GuzmÃÂ¡n be detained pending his trial due to the severity of the allegations against him, the threat he posed to the public, and the risk that he would flee the country. GuzmÃÂ¡n faces a mandatory life sentence if convicted. Prosecutors said in the indictment that the US also intends to seek the forfeiture of at least $14bn in money and property from GuzmÃÂ¡n. Capers confirmed that in order to extradite GuzmÃÂ¡n, Mexico had required that there was no possibility he would face the death penalty. The Guardian disclosed last year that the US had quietly removed specific murder charges against GuzmÃÂ¡n from his charge sheet. A grand jury indictment first filed in Brooklyn in September 2014, when the outgoing US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, was the districtÃ¢ÂÂs top federal prosecutor, had charged GuzmÃÂ¡n and an ally with 12 murders that were carried out in Mexico between 2000 and 2008, along with two attempted murders and multiple murder conspiracies against rival cartels.",cancer,"El Chapo is not a Robin Hood but a Ã¢ÂÂcancerous tumourÃ¢ÂÂ, US prosecutor says",2194.0,2194.0,194.0,
2195,"Yoga may help ease the pain and fatigue of cancer treatment, according to new research. One study conducted at the University of Rochester used two surveys to interrogate why a group of about 300 mostly female cancer patients felt less fatigued following a program of yoga. Researchers found patients who practiced yoga slept less but had less fatigue, in large part because they cut down on daytime napping. The result was a 37% reduction in Ã¢ÂÂdaytime dysfunctionÃ¢ÂÂ the studyÃ¢ÂÂs most dramatic finding.  Ã¢ÂÂWe recommend that doctors prescribe this     treatment to all cancer patients with   fatigue,Ã¢ÂÂ said   Lin, a researcher from the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, who presented one of the studies at the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago. Ã¢ÂÂWe would like them to prescribe gentle hatha yoga but they need to refer to appropriate yoga instructors who have experience of working with cancer patients. Ã¢ÂÂ In another study presented at ASCO, researchers at the Tata Memorial Centre in Mumbai, India, compared programs of yoga and conventional exercise to conventional exercise alone in an effort to find out if yoga improved quality of life for a group of more than 600 women with breast cancer.  After a year and a half of   researchers found patients who practiced both yoga and exercise were nearly twice as likely to report improved mood, 34% versus 66% and had less trouble with general activities, 41% versus 59%.  The principal investigator in the second study said scientists believe that a reduction in cortisol, sometimes called a Ã¢ÂÂstress hormoneÃ¢ÂÂ could account for the improved   among patients.  Ã¢ÂÂYoga works on the principle of mind and body health and it would help women cope with systemic therapy side effects better,Ã¢ÂÂ said Nita Nair, an associate professor of surgical oncology at Tata Memorial Centre and lead investigator. Ã¢ÂÂYoga nidra and pranayama also improve sleep patterns. Thus all this together may reduce fatigue and pain. Ã¢ÂÂ In general, research on ways to ease fatigue falls into three main categories, said William Breitbart, a psychiatrist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York who focuses on pain and cancer patients and was not involved in the study. Those areas of research are: mitigating physiological side effects such as anemia, prescribing drugs such as amphetamines, and recommending exercise programs such as yoga. Ã¢ÂÂIf you actually look at the scientific literature, most of the effective therapies look at the last group of interventions,Ã¢ÂÂ said Breitbart  Ã¢ÂÂ   treatments such as Ã¢ÂÂcognitive behavioral therapy, and more recently interventions like exercise, tai chi and yogaÃ¢ÂÂ.",cancer,How yoga could ease cancer patientsÃ¢ÂÂ pain and fatigue,2195.0,2195.0,195.0,
2196,"Brain cancer is now the deadliest childhood cancer in the US, now ahead of leukemia, a result of improved leukemia treatment and a frustrating lack of progress on brain cancer.   Government statisticians reported the change in rankings on Friday, drawing from a review of 15 years of death certificates.  Ã¢ÂÂI think most people, when they think of childhood cancer, think of leukemia,Ã¢ÂÂ said Sally Curtin of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Ã¢ÂÂThis is kind of a changing of the guard. Ã¢ÂÂ  Cancer is the fourth leading cause of death for children overall, accounting for about 1 in 10 childhood deaths in 2014. About a quarter these cancer deaths, or 534, were due to brain cancer. There were 445 leukemia deaths. Accidental injuries remained the leading cause of death for those under 19, followed by suicide and murder, according to the report.  There are still more new cases of leukemia each year than new cases of brain cancer, but it no longer accounts for the most deaths. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs due to advances in leukemia treatment over the past few decades and because leukemia is easier than brain cancer to treat, experts said.  Ã¢ÂÂSome types of leukemia that a generation ago were almost universally fatal are now almost universally treatable,Ã¢ÂÂ said Curtin, a statistician who worked on the report.  But the rate of death from brain cancer for children has held at about the same level for at least 15 years, according to the CDC report.  The trends are similar for adults too, according to the American Cancer Society.  Leukemia is a type cancer that affects the blood. That makes it easier for doctors to get to it and fight it with treatments like chemotherapy.  The brain is protected by a barrier which helps keeps many dangerous chemicals  Ã¢ÂÂ   including many cancer drugs  Ã¢ÂÂ   from getting to brain tissue or brain tumors. Surgery is difficult and sometimes impossible, depending on where the tumor is located in the brain. Radiation treatment can damage the development of a childÃ¢ÂÂs brain.  Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂs survival, and then thereÃ¢ÂÂs survival at a price,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr Katherine Warren, an expert in pediatric brain tumor research at the National Cancer Institute.  Another factor is that scientists have only recently begun to understand that pediatric brain cancers may be biologically different from adult versions, and could require different approaches to treatment.  In 2014, the brain cancer death rate was about 0. 7 per 100, 000 children ages 1 through 19. The leukemia death rate was about 0. 6. The overall pediatric cancer death rate dropped by about a fifth between 1999 and 2014, the CDC reported, helped by the reduction in leukemia deaths.

2197,"It was late. I was drunk, nearing my 35th birthday this past May, alone in a dank college dorm room, attending my   grad school reunion. The journal entry I wrote that night was just one line: Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm not the man I want to be. Ã¢ÂÂ As reunion charades go, nothing about my life actually suggested I was off track. I had ambitious public service aspirations worked tenaciously loved fiercely wrote confidently about equal opportunity and the American dream bought into and unabashedly endorsed my adopted hometown of Detroit as the best place in the country to work with meaning and purpose. IÃ¢ÂÂd published a book. IÃ¢ÂÂd supported my wife through cancer, relapse, and now four years of remission. I even ran a marathon. But my journal admission reflected two longstanding personal challenges. First, despite all my accomplishments, I carried a deeply held internal anxiety about being Ã¢ÂÂgood enoughÃ¢ÂÂ to meet my ambitions. Second, I believed my alcohol abuse posed a serious threat to it all. Combined, they exposed my biggest fear: was my life of meaning and purpose as I envisioned it slipping through my fingers? I decided to make a change. After nearly 20 years of various cycles of alcohol abuse, moderation and abstinence, I concluded I would take one last shot at forging a balanced approach to drinking before turning to sobriety. IÃ¢ÂÂd read about a drug called naltrexone, which is a pill that helps mitigate and manage alcohol cravings and abuse. After sporadically trying it over the prior year, I decided to use it every day for the next three months. Change came quickly. Two months in, my weekly consumption had cut in half it would cut in half again by early October. I lost 20 pounds and felt great. In tears, I confided to my wife, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve finally broken through. Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm so proud of you,Ã¢ÂÂ my wife replied. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm so grateful you found a path that works. LetÃ¢ÂÂs stick with it. Ã¢ÂÂ That was Monday, 10 October. Two days later, I was diagnosed with stage IV kidney cancer. Less than 15% of people with my diagnosis survive five years. This prompted a swift resolution of my other core challenge: I would no longer allow my anxiety about Ã¢ÂÂliving the right wayÃ¢ÂÂ interfere with being my true self in all dimensions of this life. There would no longer be any distinction between the Ã¢ÂÂrepresentative versionÃ¢ÂÂ of me online versus living every day with full authenticity. Any other way would be a total waste of time.  IÃ¢ÂÂve embraced the news as an invitation to be my most honest, vulnerable and wholehearted self. I live every day as fully integrated and courageously as possible. I donÃ¢ÂÂt waver. One key outlet has been a podcast I started with my wife and best friend called Defending Your Life, where we process in real time the unfiltered experience, fears and reality of dealing with stage IV cancer. I write now more directly, less esoterically, about my experience on my blog. Although my opportunities to achieve my public service or other professional goals down the road may now be limited by time or strength, I now know they wonÃ¢ÂÂt be hobbled by inauthenticity. Most importantly, IÃ¢ÂÂve come to recognize that I have lived a life of meaning and purpose. A life rich with love and connection. Some have even generously shared that IÃ¢ÂÂve lived a life that has inspired others. And, having worked through my demons, IÃ¢ÂÂm able to forgive and be proud of myself too. Of course, whatÃ¢ÂÂs scary now is while there is so much to live for, this disease, despite all the science, love and everything else needed to take it on, could very well ultimately beat me. I had surgery in October and am facing upcoming systemic treatments over the next   months, and it remains to be seen whether that will make me one of the  % who achieve a Ã¢ÂÂcomplete responseÃ¢ÂÂ or the 94% who end up somewhere else along the kidney cancer progression line. The truth is, weÃ¢ÂÂre all terminal. I could also get hit by a bus tomorrow. Or I could beat the odds and live till IÃ¢ÂÂm 90. But whatever my time left on this earth, IÃ¢ÂÂll now endeavor forward with some earned resolve. I am the person I want to be. IÃ¢ÂÂm not afraid.",cancer,I feared my life lacked meaning.

2198,"Imagine a chainsmoker comes in to see you who has lung cancer. You tell him to stop smoking, and he starts bargaining. HeÃ¢ÂÂs willing to give up donuts. You say donuts donÃ¢ÂÂt cause lung cancer, so he offers to stop watching Game of Thrones. WhatÃ¢ÂÂs clear is that he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt intend to stop smoking, and he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt want to hear about any correlation to lung cancer. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs about where this country is on gun violence.  ItÃ¢ÂÂs weird that the   gesture of a   is now being used to support gun action that apparently includes the   list. The list, as a brown friend pointed out to me, is a list of mostly brown people, who got on for various reasons, some of them dubious at best, or wildly unfair and have no path to clearing their name and getting off.  Sloppily enforced, the list apparently also targets people who have the same name as people on the watch list. Senator Ted Kennedy was treated as a   suspect at one point so have small children and lots of peaceable people. But we have mass shootings all the time, and theyÃ¢ÂÂre mostly by citizens whoÃ¢ÂÂll never get anywhere near a list like that. So this    legislation is a bandaid nowhere near the wound that matters. What we see over and over is that this society would like to imagine our epidemic of violence is by Ã¢ÂÂthemÃ¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ   some kind of marginal category: terrorist, mentally ill, nonwhite. But when it comes to mass killings, mostly itÃ¢ÂÂs an epidemic of Ã¢ÂÂusÃ¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ  mainstream men, mostly white, often young, usually miserable.  In the wake of the murder of 49 people in Orlando, people have addressed the strong correlation between domestic violence and mass shootings. According to Everytown for Gun Safety: Ã¢ÂÂMore than half of women murdered with guns in the U. S. in 2011  Ã¢ÂÂ   at least 53%  Ã¢ÂÂ   were killed by intimate partners or family members . .. This is also true for mass shootings: in 57% of the mass shootings between January 2009 and June 2014, the perpetrator killed an intimate partner or family memberÃ¢ÂÂ.  With that in mind, we could just get serious about enforcing the 1996 Lauterberg Law that allows firearms to be taken away from those convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors and prohibits them from purchasing and owning guns. ItÃ¢ÂÂs rarely actually used to require convicted abusers to surrender their guns, but it could be.  Lack of background checks also allows people who should not be allowed to buy guns to buy them. Fully enforcing that law nationwide would take away a whole lot of guns from people who are not good at   and respect and who are, as I said in the Guardian just before the Orlando massacre, the significant terrorists at large in this country. You can tell theyÃ¢ÂÂre terrorists because there are a lot of people, mostly women and children, who live in terror because of them.      legislation would not have prohibited the Orlando shooter from buying guns. He wasnÃ¢ÂÂt on it. But if we had adequate domestic violence services in this country, perhaps his first wife would have contacted the authorities, rather than just being whisked away by her family. And if he had been convicted of domestic violence, as he should have been, and we had enforced the existing federal Lautenberg law in every state, with background checks in place, then he wouldÃ¢ÂÂve been denied guns and employment as an armed guard.  ItÃ¢ÂÂs too late for that now, but not to enforce the law on the books that might prevent a lot more deaths down the road.  Beyond that, we could recognize that we have a unique kind of violence in the United States. The omnipresence of guns has something to do with it, and so does what people are now calling hypermasculinity or toxic masculinity. But thereÃ¢ÂÂs also some warped idea of individualism and   at work in the   shooting sprees.  In most countries around the world, people either kill someone theyÃ¢ÂÂre personally furious at or kill for political and economic reasons. The people they kill are killed for reasons that are coherent even if theyÃ¢ÂÂre reprehensible.  Many of our mass shootings are something else altogether: some miserable guy who finds personal relationships hard and his own psyche a mystery and a torment goes out and kills a bunch of strangers in a movie theater or a school or a workplace as a form of creative   general punishment or a desire to go out in a blaze of glory.  If the casualties are high enough, heÃ¢ÂÂll have his week or two of celebrity, thanks to the eagerness of the media to show and tell us everything about him. These days shootings involving three or four or five victims are hardly news unless the circumstances are spectacular, though. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why there was so little news about the man who allegedly shot his wife and four daughters in New Mexico the day before the Orlando bloodbath allegedly his wife had asked for a divorce. The desire to be free of abuse is often what triggers its fatal escalation. Mental illness is a factor in some  Ã¢ÂÂ   the shooter who killed six people and gravely injured Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in 2011 was said to be a paranoid schizophrenic, though he was also a supporter of   ideologies and also seemed to hate women, especially women in power like Giffords.  In many cases, including his, mental illness seems more a factor in disinhibiting people than in directing them the directions come from the outside culture. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs plenty of mental illness around the world, and it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt lead to mass murders the way it does here. (Mental illness was cited as a factor in the 2014 Isla Vista mass shooting, and it led to a California law that went into effect this year that allows temporary restraining orders preventing mentally ill people from buying and owning guns.) Some cases are apparently fueled by racism, like Dylan RoofÃ¢ÂÂs Charleston church massacre a year ago appeared to be.  In the case in Orlando, homophobia seems like a more compelling motive than Islam, and we might want to remember that the conservative mainstream has been, of late, in a frenzy of demonizing gay and lesbian and trans people, treating them as threats and outsiders and enemies.  The lesson is that a lot of the United StatesÃ¢ÂÂs mass killers are just angry men. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not   ideologues itÃ¢ÂÂs our very own armed and angry men. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not them its us. We know everything we need to about the epidemic of violence in this country, except how to overcome the opposition to diagnosing it accurately and treating it effectively. You donÃ¢ÂÂt pretend itÃ¢ÂÂs not lung cancer, unless you want to have a good excuse to not give up the cigarettes that are killing you. Donuts donÃ¢ÂÂt cause lung cancer. They never have and they never will. We all know that  Ã¢ÂÂ   some of us just donÃ¢ÂÂt want to admit it.",cancer,Our gun debate is topsy-turvy.

A family wails over their recently deceased mother, only to be interrupted by an interminable phone message from a family friend who calls to check in on her health, then gets distracted by a pressing order to a   joint. Chris Kelly, a   Emmy nominee who currently serves as writing supervisor on Saturday Night Live, swings for the fences in his   debut, juggling tragedy with   laughs. Remarkably, he succeeds, and the results recall   another tonal tightrope walk about cancer. Yet, in the end, Other People is the more devastating in its unflinching examination of the fallout of one womanÃ¢ÂÂs death on her   clan. Following that bold, hilarious opening sequence, Kelly backtracks a year to trace the gruelling months that led to such an uncomfortable scenario.  Breaking BadÃ¢ÂÂs Jesse Plemons is cast against type as David, a gay comedy writer who relocates from New York City to Sacramento to help his ailing mother, Joanne (Molly Shannon) and lend emotional support to his conservative father (Bradley Whitford) and two sisters (Maude Apatow and Madisen Beaty). David arrives in Sacramento defeated: on top of the news of his motherÃ¢ÂÂs diagnosis, the TV pilot he had high hopes for didnÃ¢ÂÂt get picked up, and he recently split from his boyfriend of five years (Zach Woods). In an effort to keep his motherÃ¢ÂÂs spirits afloat, he pretends to still be in a relationship.  JoanneÃ¢ÂÂs sunny demeanour begins to dissipate as her cancer spreads. To make the most of her last months with her family, she quits chemotherapy  Ã¢ÂÂ   a difficult decision we see in a powerhouse sequence which has Joanne grappling with her mortality alongside her husband in a hospital room. In the corridor outside, her children tearfully listen.  The laughs in Other People come in spurts, often cued by the jarring rhythms of Patrick ColmanÃ¢ÂÂs editing, as well as JoanneÃ¢ÂÂs mordant resignation. When asked by her husband over milkshakes if sheÃ¢ÂÂd like to be cremated, Joanne drolly says sheÃ¢ÂÂd like to be frozen instead: Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt like camping   Ã¢ÂÂ¦     and I donÃ¢ÂÂt like fire. Ã¢ÂÂ Also contributing chuckles are DavidÃ¢ÂÂs grandfather (Paul Dooley) prone to oversharing no matter how uncomfortable the memory, and Justin (JJ Totah) the adopted little brother of DavidÃ¢ÂÂs close friend. The child actor, best known for a short run on Glee, comes close to stealing the movie as a fiercely effeminate,   kid, whose sass lifts DavidÃ¢ÂÂs spirits.  Yet itÃ¢ÂÂs Shannon who leaves the most lasting impression. Another Saturday Night Live veteran, she effortlessly mines the material for all its uncomfortable laughs (Plemons on the other hand plays David a bit too introverted to be fully persuasive as a joke factory).

2200,"IÃ¢ÂÂve known for years that my paternal grandmother died of colon cancer in her early 40s. But I didnÃ¢ÂÂt think it had too much to do with me, beyond being a very sad fact in our family history and inspiring a lot of intense  Ã¢ÂÂ   and embarrassing  Ã¢ÂÂ   conversations about how much fiber we were eating. It wasnÃ¢ÂÂt until nearly 50 years after her death that my family learned that the cause of my grandmotherÃ¢ÂÂs cancer was Lynch syndrome, a genetic condition that carries not just a high risk of colon cancer, but endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer and skin cancer. Others, as well. We learned about my grandmotherÃ¢ÂÂs Lynch syndrome when my father was diagnosed with it six years ago: he had a skin cancer that was typical of Lynch. He had other risk factors, too: he fit the Amsterdam Criteria, which were developed by doctors in 1990 to help to identify families with Lynch. My grandmother died four years before the syndrome was identified at all.  When my dad called me on Skype to tell me the news, he was in Baltimore, and I was living in London. Ã¢ÂÂYou should get tested for this,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. I said OK, but I didnÃ¢ÂÂt do it. I was afraid. My two siblings, an older brother and a younger sister, quickly took the test. With Lynch syndrome you have a 50% chance of carrying the gene if one of your parents does. Neither of my siblings had it. When I think about the many reasons that I didnÃ¢ÂÂt get tested, I have to admit that among them was the fact that I didnÃ¢ÂÂt believe that our family could be so lucky that all three of us had escaped, even though I believe in science over luck.  I blamed administrative issues when my family asked me why I hadnÃ¢ÂÂt had the test. Lynch is rare enough that I assumed it wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be straightforward to arrange for the testing on BritainÃ¢ÂÂs National Health Service (that said, I never tried).   there was a possibility that testing positive would affect my ability to get health insurance when I moved back to the US.   I moved to Berlin, where I had one unsuccessful phone call with a genetics institute  Ã¢ÂÂ   I didnÃ¢ÂÂt know how to say Ã¢ÂÂcolon cancerÃ¢ÂÂ auf Deutsch. Too difficult, I concluded. Another reason that I didnÃ¢ÂÂt get the test  Ã¢ÂÂ   a simple blood draw  Ã¢ÂÂ   is that I was single. Prophylactic hysterectomy is the recommended treatment for women with Lynch syndrome because of the high risk of gynecological cancers. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre hard to catch early and difficult to treat. Being unpartnered in my early thirties hadnÃ¢ÂÂt troubled me too much: I was happy to wait for the right person. But now on first dates IÃ¢ÂÂd look across the rim of my pinot grigio at some man who was mostly a stranger and wonder, Ã¢ÂÂAm I going to have to tell you about the likelihood of my early surgical menopause?Ã¢ÂÂ In the spring of 2012, my father, who never smoked a thing, was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer. The tumor carried the markers of Lynch syndrome  Ã¢ÂÂ   unusual, but not unheard of. On one of my last visits home, we went to Staples together. By then it was painful for him to walk, and he looked lost in the folds of a coat heÃ¢ÂÂd worn every winter for a decade.  Before getting out of the car we sat for a moment. Ã¢ÂÂYou should get tested,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, and I stared hard through the windscreen at the big grey parking lot and said: Ã¢ÂÂYes, Dad, I know. Ã¢ÂÂ But I didnÃ¢ÂÂt intend to do it as long as he was alive. I was scared IÃ¢ÂÂd have to tell my father that I carried the same gene that had caused the cancer that was killing him. After he died at the beginning of 2014, six weeks after I moved back to the US to be near him and my mother, it felt like the biggest reason I had been avoiding the test was gone. Losing my dad was the worst thing that had ever happened to me, and IÃ¢ÂÂd survived. Getting tested, I decided, could not be worse. Lynch syndrome is bad, but it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have to be fatal: my mother pointed out that my   had it and died in her   from something else altogether. And getting tested was what my dad wanted me to do. I gave up a vial of blood and went on vacation while I waited to hear I felt a kind of relief that IÃ¢ÂÂd finally taken responsibility for my health. This was followed by a feeling of crippling regret. After I got the news, I felt for a time an intense and bleak terror about my future that was far worse than the fear IÃ¢ÂÂd had of taking the test. But in time, I started to feel better. IÃ¢ÂÂd lived with the gene since the day I was born. Now I knew that if I took precautions, my life expectancy would be normal. IÃ¢ÂÂm fortunate to have access to doctors who are enthusiastic about the project of monitoring my health: nothing is perfect, but there are many tests I can take to help identify cancer in its earliest stages.  Surgery is in my future, but several years away. I canÃ¢ÂÂt tell anyone else who is facing the decision to be tested for susceptibility to a disease what the right choice is for them.

Coffee was classified as a possible cause of cancer in 1991, but the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) which is part of WHO, has now reconsidered the evidence. It carried out a detailed review of the many studies published on the subject and found that coffee drinkers have no reason to worry. IARC also investigated the herbal drink mate, also known as chimarrÃÂ£o or cimarrÃÂ³n, which is widely consumed in South America, where oesophageal cancer is more common than in other parts of the world.  The experts found that mate was not a cause of cancer, but they believe the temperature at which it is drunk probably is  Ã¢ÂÂ   and that other very hot drinks could also be linked to oesophageal cancer. Mate is drunk at temperatures of more than 65C (149F) often through a metal straw. The scientists also looked at drinks including tea consumed at high temperatures in central Asia, China and Japan. Ã¢ÂÂIt is consumed very hot,Ã¢ÂÂ said IARCÃ¢ÂÂs Dr Dana Loomis. Ã¢ÂÂThis led to interest in other hot drinks around the world. There seems to be an effect of temperature. Ã¢ÂÂThere is limited evidence in human studies, and limited evidence in animal studies, for the carcinogenicity of very hot drinks,Ã¢ÂÂ said Loomis. IARC produces what it calls monographs on the causes of cancer, which use classifications from group one, where the link is definite, as with smoking to group four, where there is probably no link.  The new monograph classifies hot drinks as group 2A, meaning they are Ã¢ÂÂprobably carcinogenic to humansÃ¢ÂÂ. Coffee and mate served cold are in group three, which means there is insufficient evidence to believe they cause cancer. IARCÃ¢ÂÂs conclusions are published in the Lancet Oncology journal. Those who enjoy hot tea in Europe and the US probably do not need to worry, Loomis said. Ã¢ÂÂIt is important to recognise that hot drinks that were studied for the basis of this classification are perhaps a bit different from tea or coffee as consumed [in other parts of the world]  Ã¢ÂÂ   65C is quite hot. Ã¢ÂÂ In European countries, coffee and tea are usually drunk at below 60C, he said, and milk is often added, which cools it. Tea in Iran and mate in South America are often drunk at 70C. Ã¢ÂÂMate is not only prepared very hot, but drunk through a metal straw that delivers it directly into the throat,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Studies in animals have shown that very hot water can promote the growth of tumours. Ã¢ÂÂIt appears that there is thermal injury from exposure to hot liquids that is capable of leading to cancer of the oesophagus,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. IARCÃ¢ÂÂs classifications relate to the strength of the evidence for a causal association, rather than the frequency with which something causes cancer. This is why tobacco, which increases the risk of cancer   is in the same group as UV rays from sunbeds, which increase the risk of skin cancer  . The scientists found an inverse relationship between drinking coffee and certain types of cancer. The risk of developing liver cancer dropped by 15% for each cup of coffee drunk, while in breast cancer and endometrial   womb   cancer studies suggest there were fewer incidences among people who drank coffee than those who did not. Other factors could be responsible, however, and IARC does not consider that drinking coffee protects people from cancer.",cancer,"Very hot drinks may cause cancer, but coffee does not, says WHO",2201.0,2201.0,201.0,

2203,"A    girl who said before dying of cancer that she wanted a chance to live longer has been allowed by the high court to have her body cryogenically frozen in the hope that she can be brought back to life at a later time. The court ruled that the teenagerÃ¢ÂÂs mother, who supported the girlÃ¢ÂÂs wish to be cryogenically preserved, should be the only person allowed to make decisions about the disposal of her body. Her estranged father had initially opposed her wishes. During the last months of her life, the teenager, who had a rare form of cancer, used the internet to investigate cryonics. Known only as JS, she sent a letter to the court: Ã¢ÂÂI have been asked to explain why I want this unusual thing done. IÃ¢ÂÂm only 14 years old and I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to die, but I know I am going to. I think being cryoÃ¢ÂÂpreserved gives me a chance to be cured and woken up, even in hundreds of yearsÃ¢ÂÂ time.  Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt want to be buried underground. I want to live and live longer and I think that in the future they might find a cure for my cancer and wake me up. I want to have this chance. This is my wish. Ã¢ÂÂ Following the ruling, in a case described by the judge as exceptional, the body of JS has now been preserved and transported from where she lived in London to the US, where it has been frozen Ã¢ÂÂin perpetuityÃ¢ÂÂ by a commercial company at a cost of ÃÂ£37, 000. The girlÃ¢ÂÂs parents are divorced. She had lived with her mother for most of her life and had had no    contact with her father since 2008. She resisted his attempts to get back in touch when he learnt of her illness in 2015.  The judge, Mr Justice Peter Jackson, ruled that nothing about the case should be reported while she was alive because media coverage would distress her. She was too ill to attend the court hearing but the judge visited her in hospital.  Jackson wrote: Ã¢ÂÂI was moved by the valiant way in which she was facing her predicament. It is no surprise that this application is the only one of its kind to have come before the courts in this country, and probably anywhere else. It is an example of the new questions that science poses to the law, perhaps most of all to family law   Ã¢ÂÂ¦     No other parent has ever been put in [the] position [of JSÃ¢ÂÂs father]. Ã¢ÂÂ He added: Ã¢ÂÂA dispute about a parent being able to see his child after death would be momentous enough on its own if the case did not also raise the issue of cryonic preservation. Ã¢ÂÂ Since the first preservation by freezing in the 1960s the process has been performed only a few hundred times. The body has to be prepared shortly after death, ideally within minutes. Arrangements then have to be made for the body to be transported by a registered funeral director. Ã¢ÂÂThe scientific theory underlying cryonics is speculative and controversial, and there is considerable debate about its ethical implications,Ã¢ÂÂ Jackson said. Ã¢ÂÂOn the other hand, cryopreservation, the preservation of cells and tissues by freezing, is now a   process in certain branches of medicine, for example the preservation of sperm and embryos as part of fertility treatment. Cryonics is cryopreservation taken to its extreme. Ã¢ÂÂ  The judge said the girlÃ¢ÂÂs family was not well off but that her motherÃ¢ÂÂs parents had raised the money. A voluntary UK group of cryonics enthusiasts, who were not medically trained, had offered to help make arrangements.    of a hospital was required. Ã¢ÂÂThis situation gives rise to serious legal and ethical issues for the hospital trust,Ã¢ÂÂ the judge observed, Ã¢ÂÂwhich has to act within the law and has duties to its other patients and to its staff. Ã¢ÂÂ  The hospital trust in the case was willing to help although it stressed it was not endorsing cryonics. Ã¢ÂÂOn the contrary, all the professionals feel deep unease about it,Ã¢ÂÂ the judge said. The Human Tissue Authority (HTA) which regulates organisations which remove, store and use human tissue, had been consulted but said it had no remit to intervene in such a case. Ã¢ÂÂThe HTA would be likely to make representations that activities of the present kind should be brought within the regulatory framework if they showed signs of increasing,Ã¢ÂÂ Jackson said.  The HTA said: Ã¢ÂÂWe are gathering information about cryopreservation to determine how widespread it is currently, or could become in the future, and any risks it may pose to the individual, or public confidence more broadly. We are in discussion with key stakeholders   Ã¢ÂÂ¦     and the possible need for regulatory oversight. Ã¢ÂÂ The government may need to intervene in future, Jackson said: Ã¢ÂÂIt may be   Ã¢ÂÂ¦     events in this case suggest the need for proper regulation of cryonic preservation in this country if it is to happen in future. Ã¢ÂÂ Inquiries made of American authorities revealed that there was no prohibition on human remains being shipped to the US for cryonic preservation, providing certain provisions were made. During the course of the   Ã¢ÂÂs case, the father changed his mind and told the court: Ã¢ÂÂI respect the decisions [my daughter] is making. This is the last and only thing she has asked from me. Ã¢ÂÂ  A child cannot make a will and the court had to decide where the girlÃ¢ÂÂs best interests lay. The judge concluded that allowing the mother to make a decision about her daughter would be in her best interests. The girl died peacefully knowing that her body would be frozen, the judge recorded. The Department of Health said: Ã¢ÂÂCases such as this are rare. Although there are no current plans for legislative change in this area, this is an area we will continue to keep under review with the Human Tissue Authority.

2204,"A new drug that Ã¢ÂÂwakes upÃ¢ÂÂ the immune system to attack cancer has extended the lives of people with metastatic pancreatic cancer and has no   raising hopes for a new and powerful tool against the most intractable form of the disease. The drug,   is considered groundbreaking because pancreatic cancer that has spread to other parts of the body usually kills within a few months. Unlike other immunotherapy treatments,   is not thought to have any   which have been hugely debilitating for many patients and even led to   disability in some cases.  The patients who were given the new immunotherapy drug actually felt better than those who were on standard chemotherapy, said Angus Dalgleish, professor of oncology at St GeorgeÃ¢ÂÂs, University of London, who led the research. Dalgleish is excited by the potential of the immunotherapy drug, although the trial is relatively small, involving 110 people. Only 18% of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer are alive after one year and 4% after five years, so new treatments for the disease are badly needed. Ã¢ÂÂTo me itÃ¢ÂÂs really exciting,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dalgleish. Ã¢ÂÂThis is the first time we have got an immunotherapy that is a really good candidate to help control pancreatic cancer, which is one of the biggest killing diseases. Its incidence nearly matches its mortality. It is absolutely staggering. Ã¢ÂÂ Most importantly, the drug worked on the immune system without any toxic effects. Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs never been seen before,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂYou always add toxicity and misery in my experience with each additional thing you put in. Ã¢ÂÂ Adding   to the standard chemotherapy drug patients receive, gemcitabine, did not benefit those patients whose pancreatic cancer had spread locally, but it improved the lifespan of those whose cancer was metastatic  Ã¢ÂÂ   it had progressed into other parts of the body  Ã¢ÂÂ   and would be expected to die quickly.  The results are published in the British Journal of Cancer. Most of the patients  Ã¢ÂÂ   85%  Ã¢ÂÂ   had metastatic disease. Those who were just given the standard chemotherapy drug survived for a median of 4. 4 months, but those who had the   immunotherapy drug as well survived for seven months. But some lived for more than a year and one died after nearly three years. Immunotherapy drugs have produced exciting results in skin and lung cancer, but not in pancreatic tumours, which are Ã¢ÂÂvery deep and very shieldedÃ¢ÂÂ from their effects, said Dalgleish.      the immune system that the cancer has effectively switched off. Pancreatic tumours have an outer shell of cells which act like a shield.   activates the immune system, enabling it to recognise and target the tumour so that the chemotherapy drug can work. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs rather like   the immune system which has been sent to sleep,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dalgleish. It is very different in its mode of operation from the checkpoint inhibitors, which turn on the immune system in a way that causes it to kill cancer cells but often attack healthy tissue too. It is also given by a simple injection and is far cheaper than the checkpoint inhibitors.  Dalgleish says the immunotherapy drug could have uses in a wide variety of cancers. He carried out an earlier study using   which contains a killed bacterium, on skin cancer patients. Ã¢ÂÂIn my melanoma patients in particular, patients have shown greatly increased survival rates and enjoy a much better quality of life. In some patients IÃ¢ÂÂve actually seen the cancer disappearing altogether,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. The overall survival benefit, however  Ã¢ÂÂ   adding in all of the 110 patients  Ã¢ÂÂ   was not significant. Those who had   survived a median of 6. 7 months compared with 5. 6 months for those just on chemotherapy. That was because those patients in the pancreatic cancer trial who had locally advanced disease  Ã¢ÂÂ   18 out of the total of 110  Ã¢ÂÂ   appeared to do better without the immunotherapy drug. Survival was a median of 6. 7 months with   and 9. 2 months without it. Those numbers are small, which makes it hard to conclude anything from them, but Dalgleish says metastatic cancer is in effect a different disease. A new and bigger trial is being planned which will include only patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The study was supported by the Institute for Cancer Vaccines and Immunotherapy from the earliest stages. Harry Cotterell, chair of trustees, said: Ã¢ÂÂThese are exciting results and support our hope that immunotherapy will in future become a generally accepted treatment for a wide range of cancers, improving both survival rates and quality of life. Ã¢ÂÂ Other cancer experts welcomed the development of an immunotherapy drug without   but pointed to the absence of a definitive overall survival benefit for all patients. Dr Justine Alford, Cancer Research UKÃ¢ÂÂs senior science information officer, said: Ã¢ÂÂWhile the results of this early trial didnÃ¢ÂÂt show whether combining the immunotherapy drug with standard chemotherapy actually improved survival, they showed the combination treatment was safe and might help some patients. Further research with more patients is needed to develop therapies that can improve survival. Pancreatic cancer is difficult to treat and survival still remains low, which is why new treatments are urgently needed. Ã¢ÂÂ Kevin Harrington, professor of biological cancer therapies at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, and a consultant at the Royal Marsden, said: Ã¢ÂÂThis looks like a very interesting approach. It is different. It appears to be extremely   and it has led to something that looks interesting in terms of survival but it hasnÃ¢ÂÂt quite got there.

2205,"Scientists believe they may have found a way to treat a rare but devastating cancer that kills young children often within months of their diagnosis. There is currently no treatment for malignant rhabdoid tumours, which usually develop in the kidneys and have no symptoms in the early stages. By the time they are diagnosed, the cancer has often spread to other organs and is fatal. Most of those affected are infants and toddlers. The mutated gene that causes the cancer is well known, but scientists have not been able to find a way to target it. However, scientists working for the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) believe they have a made a breakthrough. They have now identified two other genes that appear to be implicated in driving the growth of the tumour, which produce proteins that can be inhibited by drugs that are already in use in other cancers or are in the development pipeline. Prof Paul Huang, team leader of the protein networks laboratory at the ICR, says they have found Ã¢ÂÂa chink in the armourÃ¢ÂÂ of these very aggressive tumours, using drugs that attack proteins known as kinase inhibitors.   Ã¢ÂÂThere are a lot of kinase drugs out there, so we donÃ¢ÂÂt have to   the wheel,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂIn many cases in drug discovery you find a new target and spend 10 to 20 years developing drugs against it. Ã¢ÂÂ  In this case, they hope that will not be necessary . Ã¢ÂÂWe have been able to   existing drugs, some of which are already approved. Ã¢ÂÂ So far, the drugs have been tested against cancer cells in the laboratory. The scientists, who have published their results in the journal Cell Reports, found that inhibiting proteins produced by one of the genes had little effect, but attacking both of them killed the cancer cells. The drugs pazopanib, dasatinib and sunitinib were all successful at inhibiting the protein from the PDGFRA gene  Ã¢ÂÂ   but if high levels of protein from the other gene, called FGFR1, remained, the cancer returned and would not respond to treatment even at higher doses. This may explain why, when doctors have tried chemotherapy with their young patients, even where it has worked at first, resistance has quickly set in. An existing drug called ponatinib, currently in use as treatment for leukaemia, can target both proteins at once. But there are questions over the safety of the drug in children, so there will be a need to screen other drugs to find one with fewer side effects that works. The cancer is very rare  Ã¢ÂÂ   there is one case in 2 million children  Ã¢ÂÂ   but the work the ICR is doing will pay dividends in other cancers too. About 20% of all cancers have genes from this class.  Studies in mice will now be necessary before the drugs can be tried in children. The ICR is leading the world in the hunt for treatments for very rare childrenÃ¢ÂÂs cancers, which are very unlikely to make a profit and are not a field that private drug companies are keen to enter. Prof Paul Workman, chief executive of the ICR in London, said: Ã¢ÂÂWe need to see much better, more targeted treatments for children with cancer, that further drive up survival rates and spare children the serious     that conventional chemotherapy can cause. Ã¢ÂÂThis study provides an exciting pointer for how we might treat more effectively an aggressive childhood cancer for which there is currently no cure. ItÃ¢ÂÂs crucial, when as here there is a strong scientific rationale for a new treatment approach in children, that we can assess them as rapidly as possible in clinical trials. At the moment, itÃ¢ÂÂs much too easy for pharmaceutical companies to avoid evaluating their drugs in children, even when there is good evidence that they could benefit. Ã¢ÂÂ Jennifer KellyÃ¢ÂÂs four   daughter Grace was diagnosed with malignant rhabdoid tumours two years ago and died soon afterwards. Her mother set up the Grace Kelly Ladybird Trust to fundraise research into childhood cancers. Ã¢ÂÂGrace went from being a happy, healthy schoolgirl to passing away within three weeks,Ã¢ÂÂ said her mother. Ã¢ÂÂShe started school in September and didnÃ¢ÂÂt make it to  . She was an athlete  Ã¢ÂÂ   she was the monkey hanging upside down from the monkey bars. Even when she was admitted to hospital initially she seemed quite well. It progressed very rapidly.  Ã¢ÂÂIt is basically a diagnosis of death, whether they try to hold it at bay with chemotherapy for a while or not. They simply canÃ¢ÂÂt treat them. There is a lack of funding for childhood cancers as a whole. People donÃ¢ÂÂt realise childhood cancer is the biggest medical cause of death in children in the UK. People think it is rare and it actually isnÃ¢ÂÂt. It is that that shocked us more than anything else.

2206,"A disabled teenage cancer patient was injured during a violent arrest by security agents at Memphis international airport, her family has alleged in a lawsuit filed against the Transport Security Administration. Hannah Cohen, 18, at the time of her arrest on 30 June 2015, and her mother had been on their way home to Chattanooga from St JudeÃ¢ÂÂs hospital in Memphis, where Hannah underwent her final treatment for a brain tumor. Hannah and her mother, Shirley, told the Guardian that the pair had made the trip hundreds of times, and knew the airport security routine well. Shirley would usually go through the scanner first and wait for Hannah on the other side, since HannahÃ¢ÂÂs tumor, and numerous surgeries and treatments since she was two years old, had left her easily confused and frightened in unfamiliar situations.  According to the complaint, the warning alarm was triggered when Hannah passed through the body scanners. Hannah attributed the alarm to her shirtÃ¢ÂÂs design. Ã¢ÂÂMy shirt  Ã¢ÂÂ   it had sequins,Ã¢ÂÂ Hannah told the Guardian, laboring to speak. According to the complaint: Ã¢ÂÂYou could see on the screen what it was pointing out,Ã¢ÂÂ Shirley said. She stood to the side, watching, wearing an immobilization boot on a broken foot. Agents told Hannah they needed to take her to a Ã¢ÂÂsterile areaÃ¢ÂÂ where they could search her further. She was afraid, Shirley said, and offered to take off the sequined shirt as she was wearing another underneath, but a female agent laughed at her. Seeing the scene begin to unfold, Shirley hobbled to a supervisor standing nearby. Ã¢ÂÂShe is a St JudeÃ¢ÂÂs patient, and she can get confused,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂPlease be gentle. If I could just help her, it will make things easier. Ã¢ÂÂ But soon, a voice on the public address system requested more agents to report to the checkpoint, Shirley said. Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs when the armed guards came. Ã¢ÂÂ  The brain tumor had left Hannah blind in one eye, deaf in one ear and partially paralyzed, so when the guards grabbed each of her arms, it startled her, she said. Ã¢ÂÂI tried to push away,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂI tried to get away. Ã¢ÂÂ The guards slammed Hannah to the ground, her mother said, smashing her face into the floor, which the complaint alleges left her Ã¢ÂÂphysically and emotionallyÃ¢ÂÂ injured. Shirley had just picked up her phone from the conveyor belt, and she snapped a photo of Hannah on the floor: handcuffed, weeping and bleeding.  Ã¢ÂÂAnother guard pushed me back 20ft, in my boot, and told me I couldnÃ¢ÂÂt be nearby,Ã¢ÂÂ said Shirley, a professor of nursing at a university in Chattanooga.  Ã¢ÂÂI felt so helpless. I sat down on a bench facing away so I couldnÃ¢ÂÂt see what they were doing to my daughter. Ã¢ÂÂ The lawsuit alleges that the TSA did not give Hannah adequate accommodation to screen her, and discriminated against her because of her disability. It names the TSA and the   County airport authority and seeks damages that include medical expenses and for personal injury, both physical and emotional. It calls for a Ã¢ÂÂreasonable sum not exceeding $100, 000 and costsÃ¢ÂÂ and an undisclosed punitive amount.  The TSA has not yet responded to the complaint. Hannah disappeared behind a door, then went to a hospital, and finally to the Shelby County jail. After 24 hours apart, the mother and daughter were reunited in the parking lot of the jail. Shirley said she held her daughter, who sobbed, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm sorry, Mama. Ã¢ÂÂ The next morning  Ã¢ÂÂ   now two days without their belongings, which had made the flight home  Ã¢ÂÂ   the pair appeared before a local judge, who asked the accused to explain herself.  When Hannah responded, the judge said: Ã¢ÂÂYouÃ¢ÂÂre going to have to speak up. Ã¢ÂÂ ThatÃ¢ÂÂs when Hannah looked up and her hair fell back from her face, revealing her unseeing eye, surrounded by cuts and contusions.  Ã¢ÂÂThe judgeÃ¢ÂÂs eyes got big and round,Ã¢ÂÂ Shirley said.  After inquiring if the pair were from Memphis, the judge recommended they get legal representation. The charges were all dropped two days later, and the court refunded the $250 in costs the family had paid. The TSA did not immediately return a request for comment. But a TSA spokeswoman, Sari Koshetz, said in a statement that Ã¢ÂÂpassengers can call ahead of time to learn more about the screening process for their particular needs or medical situationÃ¢ÂÂ. Ã¢ÂÂWhy should I do that when weÃ¢ÂÂve been going through that airport for 17 years?Ã¢ÂÂ Shirley said.  Ã¢ÂÂThese people think they are God. They think they can do anything they want,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂWell, in this country we have the Americans with Disabilities Act. And if they will do this to a disabled girl, does that mean theyÃ¢ÂÂll do it to an    grandmother? ItÃ¢ÂÂs time for justice.

2207,"Americans love tattoos. Nearly a quarter of them have gotten inked, compared with 12% in Europe. The personal expression that is skin deep is particularly popular with young people: 40% of American teenagers sport tattoos. Women are also more likely than men to get one. Yet very little is known about the effects of modern day tattoo ink on the human body. The lack of research and data is worrisome because some of the key ingredients are known to make people sick or die. It also makes it difficult to regulate them. A recent report from the European Commission warns that tattoo ink often contains Ã¢ÂÂhazardous chemicalsÃ¢ÂÂ such as heavy metals and preservatives that could have serious health consequences, including bacterial infections. A separate study issued earlier this month by the Australian government reveals that 22% of the inks tested contained chemical compounds known to cause cancer. The European report notes that regulators are especially wary of imports from the US, which supplies the majority of tattoo inks to the world. The report highlights the health risks and provides European countries with scientific evidence so they can decide if better oversight of tattoo inks is necessary. Ã¢ÂÂThe question is, whatÃ¢ÂÂs in the tattoo and what can it do to the body?Ã¢ÂÂ said Tyler Hollmig, director of Laser and Aesthetic Dermatology at Stanford University Health Care. Ã¢ÂÂThe answer is, we just donÃ¢ÂÂt know. Ã¢ÂÂ Tattoos work by injecting the ink into the second layer of skin known as the dermis, where the ink remains permanently unless it is removed using laser technology. Ã¢ÂÂThe skin is very active in protecting the body from infection, and white blood cells try to eat up tattoo ink,Ã¢ÂÂ said Hollmig. Ã¢ÂÂThe body treats the ink as a foreign substance. Ã¢ÂÂ The Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesnÃ¢ÂÂt need to approve tattoo inks before they go on the market. The agency can regulate the pigments used by screening them beforehand, but it seldom does so Ã¢ÂÂbecause of other competing public health priorities and a pervasive lack of evidence of safety problems specifically associated with these pigments,Ã¢ÂÂ said Lauren Sucher, an FDA spokesperson. The agency will investigate an ink only when a safety issue is reported. This happened last year, when   company, A Thousand Inks voluntarily recalled some of its products after the FDA found bacterial contamination in unopened bottles of the firmÃ¢ÂÂs grey wash shades. The FDA tested the ink following an outbreak of skin infections in people who had recently got tattoos in Florida. The FDA warned tattoo artists that using the contaminated inks could lead to skin irritation such as redness and swelling, and could spread throughout the body, resulting in swollen lymph nodes and even sepsis, a life threatening blood infection. Ã¢ÂÂThese infections may be severe and may require extensive treatment with antibiotics, hospitalization or surgery,Ã¢ÂÂ warned the FDA. This kind of public health scare and the popularity of tattoos and emergence of health problems are forcing the FDA to consider more oversight over this $2. 3bn industry. ItÃ¢ÂÂs currently investigating how tattoo ink is broken down in the body and its long term safety at the National Center for Toxicological Research in Arkansas. Researchers are examining some pigments, like Yellow 74, which fade in the sunlight. Ã¢ÂÂWe want to know what happens to the ink,Ã¢ÂÂ said Paul Howard, the lead research chemist. Ã¢ÂÂWhere does the pigment go?Ã¢ÂÂ Howard said the pigment may still be there, and that it could be toxic. His team is also looking at the possibility that the body digests and secretes ink in the same way that it destroys bacteria when fighting infection. Meanwhile, ink manufacturers already have to contend with rules from some state or local governments. In 2005, a California judge ruled that two major tattoo ink makers  Ã¢ÂÂ   Huck Spaulding Enterprises and Superior Tattoo Equipment  Ã¢ÂÂ   must include a label on their products warning California customers the ink contains heavy metals that could cause Ã¢ÂÂcancer, birth defects and reproductive harmÃ¢ÂÂ. Some companies claim to use safer ingredients in their ink. Kuro Sumi, a Japanese manufacturer, and   Eternal Ink say they use organic pigments that are  . But since there are no industry regulations for terms like Ã¢ÂÂorganicÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂnaturalÃ¢ÂÂ itÃ¢ÂÂs hard to know whether products containing these ingredients are indeed safer. Tattoo ink is generally sold    and typically contains a number of ingredients, including colorants, preservatives, binding agents and fillers. Colorants, more commonly called pigments, can constitute up to 60% of an ink by weight, according to the EU study. The pigments used by manufacturers arenÃ¢ÂÂt specifically made for use in tattoos, and many are Ã¢ÂÂ  colors suitable for printersÃ¢ÂÂ ink or automobile paintÃ¢ÂÂ according to the FDA. The overall longevity and potential toxicity may differ depending on the color. To make black ink, for instance, manufacturers might use soot or powdered jet, or cinnabar and common rust to make red. Some of the ink ingredients, like the metal cadmium, are known carcinogens, while others, like carbon black, are Ã¢ÂÂpossibly carcinogenicÃ¢ÂÂ according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, an arm of the World Health Organization (Who). Yet this doesnÃ¢ÂÂt necessarily mean those ingredients are dangerous to human health, said Hayley Goldbach, a resident physician in dermatology at UCLA Health, a healthcare system affiliated with the University of California at Los Angeles. Ã¢ÂÂJust because something can cause cancer doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean that it does,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂAs far as I know there have not been any studies convincingly or conclusively linking tattoo pigment to an increased risk for cancer. Ã¢ÂÂ A 2012 paper by Finnish researchers, who analyzed previous studies, found the number of skin cancers inside tattoos was Ã¢ÂÂseemingly lowÃ¢ÂÂ and that any link had to be considered Ã¢ÂÂthus far as coincidentalÃ¢ÂÂ. Tattoos can camouflage moles, however, making it difficult to monitor tattooed patients for skin cancer. And tattoo ink ingredients like cadmium have been found in lymph nodes, which help filter waste from the body. According to the EU study, these substances could spread from the lymph nodes to the rest of the body, although more research is needed to support this theory, wrote the authors. Hollmig said he sees skin cancer in and around tattoos, but itÃ¢ÂÂs hard to say whether itÃ¢ÂÂs the ink causing the illness. Ã¢ÂÂYou figure that you inject the carcinogen and skin cancer grows there, but we donÃ¢ÂÂt have data on that,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. The most common   complaints he sees in his practice are skin irritations, usually caused by red ink, which typically contains mercury, a known allergen. Ã¢ÂÂJust the red area of the tattoo would have swollen, tender and really itchy reactions,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, adding that these adverse health effects can occur months and even years after a person gets the tattoo. A 2015 study from New York UniversityÃ¢ÂÂs Langone Medical Center found that at least 6% of tattooed New Yorkers suffered a serious reaction like swelling and severe itching that lasted for more than four months. Almost half of these reactions were to red ink, while   of the cases were linked to black ink. As for tattoo artists, most do care about the safety of the pigments that they use on their clients, said Mike Martin, a veteran tattoo artist and president of the Alliance of Professional Tattooists, a nonprofit that promotes safe tattooing. Ã¢ÂÂPigments are super important to the finished product and our products are what people judge us on,Ã¢ÂÂ said Martin. Ã¢ÂÂGreat color, great line work, quick healing,   no weird skin reactions  Ã¢ÂÂ   these are all hallmarks of good professional tattooing. Ã¢ÂÂ Without strong regulations, however, problematic inks will continue to show up at tattoo parlors. For example, tattoo manufacturers can use different recipes and make their own blends, which could contain different levels of carcinogens and allergens. This makes it Ã¢ÂÂvery hard to study them for safetyÃ¢ÂÂ said Goldbach. Ã¢ÂÂThe composition of tattoo ink has changed over time so it also means that new and potentially dangerous agents could be introduced into tattoo ink at any time,Ã¢ÂÂ she said.",cancer,Tattoo ink contains cancer-causing chemicals Ã¢ÂÂ so why isnÃ¢ÂÂt it regulated?,2207.0,2207.0,207.0,
2208,"Millions of young British men are being denied a vaccine that could protect them from throat cancers in later life. Scientists say the problem is becoming increasingly worrying as rates of human papilloma virus (HPV)  Ã¢ÂÂ   a common sexually transmitted infection and the prime cause of these cancers  Ã¢ÂÂ   are now rising exponentially. Researchers want the government to include adolescent boys in the current vaccine programme that immunises girls aged 12 and 13 against HPV before they become sexually active. HPV in women is known to lead to cervical cancers. The vaccine, if extended to boys, would protect them in later life against   head and neck cancers. Ã¢ÂÂIf we want to eradicate male throat cancers  Ã¢ÂÂ   which are soaring in numbers  Ã¢ÂÂ   we need to act speedily and that means giving them the HPV vaccine we now give to girls,Ã¢ÂÂ said Professor Mark Lawler of QueenÃ¢ÂÂs University Belfast. Health experts say increased levels of oral sex are in part responsible for the spread of HPV. Ã¢ÂÂSmoking and alcohol add to risks, but the fact that couples are having more and more oral sex is the main factor,Ã¢ÂÂ said Peter Baker, campaign director of HPV Action. A vaccine to block HPV infections was developed a decade ago and from 2008 formed the basis of a programme to inoculate UK schoolgirls to protect them from cervical cancer later in life.  At present more than 3, 000 women develop cervical cancer a year in the UK. Most other western nations have since introduced similar programmes. Ã¢ÂÂHPV is spread sexually. However, this vaccine will not work effectively if a person has already been infected by HPV,Ã¢ÂÂ said Baker. Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs why it is given to girls when they are 12 or 13  Ã¢ÂÂ   before they are sexually active. Ã¢ÂÂ Tens of thousands of young women are now given the vaccine, although it is too early to say how cervical cancer rates are going to be affected, said virologist Professor Sheila Graham, of Glasgow University.  Ã¢ÂÂHowever, rates of genital warts in women  Ã¢ÂÂ   which are also caused by HPV  Ã¢ÂÂ   are going down, so there is confidence the vaccine will work. Ã¢ÂÂ However, the introduction of the HPV vaccine for women has come just as infection rates in men have started to soar, with cases of tonsil cancers and cancers of the base of the tongue  Ã¢ÂÂ   both caused by the virus  Ã¢ÂÂ   rising dramatically. Tonsil cancer cases have tripled in numbers since the 1990s, for example.  Ã¢ÂÂUnfortunately, these cancers have very serious outcomes with dreadful morbidity,Ã¢ÂÂ added Graham. Scientists say it would cost about ÃÂ£20m a year to extend the current HPV vaccine programme to boys.  Ã¢ÂÂBy contrast, it costs about ÃÂ£30m a year to treat males for genital warts while the costs of treating the rising numbers of throat cancers are even greater,Ã¢ÂÂ Lawler said. Ã¢ÂÂSo, in purely monetary terms, it makes sense to give boys the vaccine. Ã¢ÂÂ This point is disputed by some health economists. They say the human papilloma virus will have virtually disappeared from sexually active UK women in a few decades, thanks to the vaccine now given to girls at school. As a result men will no longer pick up the virus when having oral sex with women. This effect is known as herd immunity. But Professor Margaret Stanley, of Cambridge University, said the argument was flawed. Ã¢ÂÂRelying on   vaccine programmes to remove HPV from the population is risky. Ã¢ÂÂIn Denmark the   rate of the vaccine recently dropped from around 80% to 20% because of a scare story  Ã¢ÂÂ   which was quite untrue  Ã¢ÂÂ   suggesting the vaccine was spreading disease. We need protection for both sexes to be sure we eradicate HPV. Ã¢ÂÂ In addition, reliance on a   vaccine programme would mean that gay men would never be provided with protection against HPV, she added.  This last point was crucial is persuading health officials in Australia to extend its school HPV vaccine programme to men in 2013. It is the only country to run a free HPV vaccine programme for both sexes. The governmentÃ¢ÂÂs joint committee on vaccination has been considering extending the HPV programme to boys for several years but is not due to give a ruling until 2017. Ã¢ÂÂEven if it gives approval then, we are unlikely to get the programme extended to boys until around 2020,Ã¢ÂÂ said Baker. Ã¢ÂÂBy then millions who could have been protected against throat cancers will have lost the chance to get the vaccine. Ã¢ÂÂ Stanley was also emphatic the vaccine programme should be extended. Ã¢ÂÂA great many health experts in this field are paying privately to have their sons vaccinated.  Ã¢ÂÂIt costs ÃÂ£160 for a double shot. I have had my grandson vaccinated. The nature of the problem is obvious. Ã¢ÂÂIn any case, it is simply discriminatory not to give a vaccine to men when it could save their lives.

2209,"The first results from a major project to measure the reliability of cancer research have highlighted a big problem: Labs trying to repeat published experiments often canÃ¢ÂÂt. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not to say that the original studies are wrong. But the results of a review published Thursday, in the   journal eLife, are a sobering reminder that science often fails at one of its most basic requirements  Ã¢ÂÂ   an experiment in one lab ought to be reproducible in another one. And the fact that they often arenÃ¢ÂÂt could have big health implications. Many exciting ideas in cancer research never pan out. One reason is that findings from the initial studies donÃ¢ÂÂt stand the test of time. Ã¢ÂÂReproducibility is a central feature of how science is supposed to be,Ã¢ÂÂ says Brian Nosek, who spearheaded this research at the Center for Open Science. Nosek is also a psychology professor at the University of Virginia. A few years ago, he organized a similar effort to examine research in his field. And his results garnered worldwide attention when   of the original findings in psychology couldnÃ¢ÂÂt be reproduced. Nosek decided to explore the work from cancer biology labs after two   studies, from drugmakers Bayer and Amgen, reported dismal results when they tried to reproduce some cancer papers. Only 25 percent of the papers Bayer examined were reproduced. Amgen was able to replicate only six out of the 53 studies it examined. Ã¢ÂÂThose were earthshaking reports, in the sense that the community responded very strongly to these reports of challenges to reproduce some of these core findings,Ã¢ÂÂ Nosek says. But scientists at Bayer and Amgen wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt say which experiments they examined, so their work raised many questions but left no way for scientists to answer them. Ã¢ÂÂThe cancer reproducibility project in cancer biology was an attempt to advance that discussion with an open project,Ã¢ÂÂ Nosek says. This project is transparent about how it picked the studies to reproduce. It also published methods and study plans in advance. In collaboration with a California company called Science Exchange, the reviewers got grants to replicate key experiments from as many as 50   studies. (They will very likely run out of money before theyÃ¢ÂÂre able to complete that work, however.) TheyÃ¢ÂÂve now published the results of their first five attempts, in eLife. Ã¢ÂÂThree of the five show very, very striking differences from the original,Ã¢ÂÂ says Timothy Errington, a biologist at the Center for Open Science and collaborator in the project. As for findings from the other two studies, he says, Ã¢ÂÂI think youÃ¢ÂÂll get a lot of opinions about whether they replicate or not.Ã¢ÂÂ Errington says he was quite surprised by the results. In one case, the original scientists went the extra mile to help the labs doing the   studies reduce potential sources of error. Ã¢ÂÂThe lab gave us the same drug. This is wonderful. Because that could have been a sticking point,Ã¢ÂÂ Errington says. Ã¢ÂÂThey gave us the same tumor cells that they used.Ã¢ÂÂ Yet the replicating lab didnÃ¢ÂÂt end up with the same results. Scientists have had so much confidence in two of the original studies that drug companies already have sunk millions of dollars into efforts to try the concepts out in people. But the   experiments for one of those didnÃ¢ÂÂt validate the original results. The inevitable question is whether the original science was wrong, or whether the scientists who tried to repeat that work somehow got tripped up. The review project farmed out its actual laboratory work to commercial labs that perform experiments for the pharmaceutical industry, or to university Ã¢ÂÂcore facilities,Ã¢ÂÂ such as centralized labs that do a lot of research on mice. Those labs generally work to standards required by the Food and Drug Administration. But research with living systems is never simple, so there are many possible sources of variation in any experiment, ranging from the animals and cells to the details of lab technique. And there isnÃ¢ÂÂt even clear agreement about when a studyÃ¢ÂÂs findings can be considered to have been reproduced. Sean Morrison, an editor at eLife and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, says that by his count, two studiesÃ¢ÂÂ findings were substantially reproduced. The findings of one other were not, he says, and two others have results that simply canÃ¢ÂÂt be interpreted. Ã¢ÂÂOne of the difficulties of the reproducibility project is they have limited time and resources to spend on any one study,Ã¢ÂÂ Morrison says. Ã¢ÂÂAs a result, they canÃ¢ÂÂt go back and do these things over and over again when the first results turn out to be uninterpretable.Ã¢ÂÂ Errington agrees that the reproducibility project leaves that big question hanging  Ã¢ÂÂ   but the scientists donÃ¢ÂÂt plan to answer it. Ã¢ÂÂAs exciting as that is, and as important as that is  Ã¢ÂÂ   and we hope someone else will follow up on it  Ã¢ÂÂ   weÃ¢ÂÂre more curious about, Ã¢ÂÂWhat does that look like when we do this across many, many, many studies.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ But Dr. Erkki Ruoslahti, at the nonprofit Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute in La Jolla, Calif. is worried that the reproducibility project could do real damage. The reviewers couldnÃ¢ÂÂt reproduce his original study but didnÃ¢ÂÂt follow up to understand why. Ã¢ÂÂI am really worried about what this will do to our ability to raise funding for our clinical development,Ã¢ÂÂ he writes in an email to Shots. Ã¢ÂÂIf we, and the many laboratories who have reproduced our results, are right and the reproducibility study is wrong  Ã¢ÂÂ   which I think is the case  Ã¢ÂÂ   they will not be doing a favor to cancer patients.Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Irving Weissman, a professor of pathology and developmental biology at Stanford University, is also disappointed in how the reproducibility project handled his experiment. His paper reported finding a protein thatÃ¢ÂÂs present on all human cancer cells  Ã¢ÂÂ   a finding that Weissman says has been replicated many times in other labs. The reproducibility project chose to repeat a peripheral part of WeissmanÃ¢ÂÂs paper  Ã¢ÂÂ   an experiment involving mice, not human tissues. And, Weissman says, the replicating lab stumbled over an early step in the experiment, but plowed ahead anyway. Weissman says he offered to bring scientists into his lab to train them in the technique, but the Reproducibility Project didnÃ¢ÂÂt do that. (That would undercut one of its goals, which is to see whether scientists working independently can verify published results.) ItÃ¢ÂÂs important to replicate important studies, Weissman tells Shots, Ã¢ÂÂbut you canÃ¢ÂÂt do it halfheartedly. You have to be serious about it.Ã¢ÂÂ Errington and Nosek hope people who hear about the projectÃ¢ÂÂs findings donÃ¢ÂÂt jump to any conclusions about why individual studies came to different conclusions. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre trying to look at the big picture across dozens of studies, the two scientists say, and they donÃ¢ÂÂt place too much confidence in any single result. The reproducibility project is looking for patterns across cancer research and also trying to identify common reasons that labs might have trouble reproducing one anotherÃ¢ÂÂs work. Are the directions offered in the methods section of a paper too sketchy? Or maybe experiments frequently work only under unusual conditions. Morrison, who is involved as a journal editor rather than a participant, says the entire reproducibility project is itself one big experiment. Ã¢ÂÂI think itÃ¢ÂÂs too early for us to know whether this approach is the right approach or the best approach for testing the reproducibility of cancer biology,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Ã¢ÂÂBut it will be a data point, and it will start the conversation.Ã¢ÂÂ The conversation is important because the vast majority of treatment ideas that come from the lab fail when theyÃ¢ÂÂre tried in people. Cathy   a pharmacologist at the University of California, San Francisco, says scientists often donÃ¢ÂÂt know why those clinical failures occur, Ã¢ÂÂand so thatÃ¢ÂÂs why I think studies like this are really, really important.Ã¢ÂÂ Unfortunately, Nosek says, there are few incentives today for scientists to repeat experiments from other labs. The rewards are for publishing new ideas, not the less glamorous, but still critical, work of verifying somebody elseÃ¢ÂÂs findings. Ã¢ÂÂIf weÃ¢ÂÂre going to take reproducibility seriously,Ã¢ÂÂ Nosek says, experiments that attempt to reproduce the findings of others Ã¢ÂÂneed to be a valued part of scientific contribution.Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,What Does It Mean When Cancer Findings CanÃ¢ÂÂt Be Reproduced?,2209.0,2209.0,209.0,
2210,"Screening for lung cancer using   CT scans can save lives, but at a cost: Tests frequently produce   false alarms and prompt unnecessary procedures. A study from the Veterans Health Administration lays out the considerable effort required by both patients and doctors to undertake screening. Ã¢ÂÂI have heard people say Ã¢ÂÂwhatÃ¢ÂÂs the big deal, itÃ¢ÂÂs just a CT,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ says Dr. Linda Kinsinger, who ran the study at the VA. Ã¢ÂÂBut I think what we tried to show is itÃ¢ÂÂs a lot more than just a CT.Ã¢ÂÂ Federal officials and other medical groups recommend   CT scans to look for lung cancer among people at risk, generally those over the age of 55 who have smoked at least the equivalent of two packs a day for 15 years. The tests typically cost $300, and they arenÃ¢ÂÂt always covered by insurance. Screening does identify cancers, but in the vast majority of cases the test produces false alarms. In the VA study, which was published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, 4, 246 patients were eligible for screening. About half of them declined to take the test, even though it was offered at no cost. Of those who took the test, about 55 percent of them were told that they had lung nodules, which often involved   appointments and further scans. But very few of those nodules were actually real problems. In the end, the screeners identified 31 cases of lung cancer, about 20 of which were in the early, most treatable stage. The study involved eight of the 150 or so VA hospitals, and was designed to assess the overall benefits and potential harms of setting up a screening program in a large medical institution. So is it a good idea? Ã¢ÂÂI think itÃ¢ÂÂs a close call,Ã¢ÂÂ Kinsinger says. There was a benefit to the 20 or so patients out of this large initial population who had their cancer detected while it was likely to be treatable. Ã¢ÂÂBut that has to be weighed against the amount of effort on the part of both patients and staff, and the anxiety, the worry, that a false alarm will cause among patients,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. Ã¢ÂÂI think a lot of people have a much rosier view of screening in general than the facts bear out,Ã¢ÂÂ says Dr. Rita Redberg, editor of JAMA Internal Medicine and a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. Ã¢ÂÂVery few people are actually helped by screening, and a lot of time there are a number of harms.Ã¢ÂÂ Another study published in the same issue found that many people getting CT screens are actually at low risk for lung cancer. Dr. Jinhai Huo and colleagues at the MD Anderson Cancer Center compared screening rates before and after 2011, the year of a key study that supported the idea of   CT screening for lung cancer. Ã¢ÂÂOnce a [radiology] center has the ability to do this screening, they like to use their technology to do as many people as possible,Ã¢ÂÂ Redberg says, Ã¢ÂÂand it seems that   people who are really unlikely to get any benefit and are much more likely to get harmed are getting screened in higher numbers than in the   people who are supposed to be screened.Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Jorge Gomez, a spokesman for the American Lung Association and an oncologist at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York, says that while screening   people doesnÃ¢ÂÂt make sense on a population basis, it sometimes makes sense for individual patients. And as for the experience at the VA, Gomez says medical teams that have learned to interpret the results of scans can generally weed out   results without resorting to biopsies or other invasive   tests. Ã¢ÂÂThere is a concern for unnecessary procedures at institutions where they donÃ¢ÂÂt have the expertise in reading these scans,Ã¢ÂÂ he says.

2211,"Cancer researchers are testing whether a generic drug that has been used for more than 40 years to treat parasitic infections may also help fight cancer. The tests of mebendazole are part of a growing effort to take a fresh look at old medicines to see if they can be repurposed for new uses. I first learned about mebendazole several years back when my son came home from camp with a gross but common infection: pinworms. My pediatrician prescribed two doses of mebendazole, and two weeks later the infection was gone.   a couple of years, and I was surprised to find on clinicaltrials. gov, the federal database of medical trials, that mebendazole was being investigated as a potential cancer drug. Curious, I contacted Gregory Riggins, a cancer researcher at Johns Hopkins University who is testing the safety of mebendazole as a potential cancer treatment. He invited me to his lab in Baltimore. Riggins took me inside and showed me cages of cancer research mice. A few years back, he said, his idea to test mebendazole started here. Some of the lab animals got infected with pinworms, the same parasite my son had. The veterinarian at Johns Hopkins treated the whole colony of mice with an animal version of mebendazole. The drug staved off the parasite, but it also did something surprising. Before the mice were treated for pinworms, Riggins and his team had implanted cancer cells into the animalsÃ¢ÂÂ brains. But after the mice got the pinworm drug, the cancers never developed. Ã¢ÂÂOur medulloblastoma stopped growing,Ã¢ÂÂ Riggins says. He found out that other researchers were conducting animal studies to see if the drug had effects on lung cancer and melanoma. So he got funding to do two Phase 1 studies to test whether mebendazole is safe to use in brain cancer patients, one in children and another in adults. So far the drug appears to be safe and well tolerated by patients, Riggins says. That would be expected, given that it has been used for decades around the world to treat pinworms. Ã¢ÂÂBased on the preclinical studies it looks like it has promise,Ã¢ÂÂ says Tracy Batchelor, director of the division of   at Massachusetts General Hospital, who is not involved in the research. Ã¢ÂÂThe next step is to look for a benefit in a Phase 2 trial.Ã¢ÂÂ That would test whether mebendazole has any effect on cancer in people. Riggins hopes to conduct that sort of trial in adult brain cancer patients. At a time when it can cost a billion dollars to develop a new drug, the idea of repurposing existing drugs is appealing, according to Bruce Bloom. HeÃ¢ÂÂs the president and chief science officer of Cures Within Reach, which has helped to fund RigginsÃ¢ÂÂ research. Bloom points to research on metformin, a diabetes drug thatÃ¢ÂÂs being looked at as a potential treatment for a dozen different kinds of cancer and also tuberculosis. A common blood pressure drug, propranolol, is also being studied. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs not likely that mebendazole or any other single repurposed drug is ever going to cure cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ Bloom says. But he envisions the possibility that combinations of repurposed drugs might help the body to manage cancer. Any use of mebendazole as a cancer drug would be years away, if it proves to work at all. Most drugs that emerge from Phase 1 trials never deliver the   benefits. And in an odd twist to a complicated story, the cost of mebendazole in the U. S. has skyrocketed in recent years. Though it remains very affordable in most countries, the wholesale cost of a 100 mg tablet in the U. S. has risen from $4. 50 in 2011 to $369 in 2016, according to Truven Health Analytics. The dynamics that led to the price hike were in play before interest rose in the drug as a potential cancer treatment, analysts say. In 2013, Amedra Pharmaceuticals bought marketing rights to mebendazole from Teva Pharmaceuticals. It already owned rights to another key generic antiparasitic drug, albendazole. Ã¢ÂÂAt that point, anyone who has had a high school or undergraduate economics course would be able to explain the price hike,Ã¢ÂÂ says Joey Mattingly, an assistant professor in the department of pharmacy practice and science at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy who studies generic drug pricing. That leaves people with pinworm infections with the choice of two expensive prescription medications or cheaper    options. Ã¢ÂÂPinworms are exceedingly common,Ã¢ÂÂ says Rachel Orscheln, an assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Washington University and St. Louis ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital. The CDC estimates 40 million people are infected in the U. S. annually. Orscheln says the people most likely to be infected are children and people who are living in group settings such as nursing homes. Ã¢ÂÂThere are certain cases where we do need to prescribe this medication,Ã¢ÂÂ says Orscheln. But at the higher price, she says, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm very disinclined to prescribe [it].Ã¢ÂÂ She says    drugs such as   or pyrantel, can work just as well in children, so Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm very likely to steer people in that direction.Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,A Pinworm Medication Is Being Tested As A Potential Anti-Cancer Drug,2211.0,2211.0,211.0,
2212,"If the last few years are any guide, one group that may find itself in the crosshairs of Rep. Tom Price, President TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, is an influential panel of medical experts. The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force, a group of mostly physician and academics from top universities, reviews medical practices to see whether they are supported by research and evidence. Under the Affordable Care Act, the USPSTFÃ¢ÂÂs recommendations have been used to guide private insurers. If the group gives a test high marks, insurers are required to cover it. If it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt, they are free not to. But letters reviewed by ProPublica show that Price twice pushed HHS to quash the task forceÃ¢ÂÂs recommendations to limit widely used cancer screenings. The panel said that the screenings too often led to unnecessary biopsies and other harmful treatment. Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee boycotted a Tuesday vote on PriceÃ¢ÂÂs nomination, citing unanswered ethics questions. In 2011, Price and other lawmakers signed a letter asking the head of HHS to Ã¢ÂÂpush for the withdrawalÃ¢ÂÂ of the panelÃ¢ÂÂs draft prostate screening recommendations. The panel was made up of Ã¢ÂÂbureaucrats,Ã¢ÂÂ the letter said, and decisions about prostate testing were best left to doctors and their patients. Ã¢ÂÂThis recommendation jeopardizes the health of countless American men,Ã¢ÂÂ the letter said. The task force went ahead and in 2012 recommended that men of all ages forgo using blood tests to search for prostate cancer. The recommendation didnÃ¢ÂÂt apply to men with a history of prostate cancer. Three years later, Price signed two letters protesting the task forceÃ¢ÂÂs proposed recommendations that mammograms be given every two years for healthy and   women between the ages of 50 and 74, and by individual choice for women between 40 and 49. Other groups, including the American College of Radiology, recommend starting mammograms at 40 and having them every year or two. In May 2015, Price and other lawmakers wrote that the USPSTF recommendations Ã¢ÂÂwould jeopardize access to screenings.Ã¢ÂÂ In June, a second letter signed by Price and others with the GOP Doctors Caucus, went further, urging the head of HHS to ensure the recommendations werenÃ¢ÂÂt finalized. The recommendations, the letter said, could Ã¢ÂÂresult in thousands of additional breast cancer deaths.Ã¢ÂÂ Despite the complaints, the mammogram recommendations were issued in 2016. Proponents praised them as the fruit of the task forceÃ¢ÂÂs independent and   approach. But the guidelines raised the ire of a much more powerful constituency: the urologists and radiologists who made billions of dollars off the testing and related procedures. Ã¢ÂÂThe dirty underbelly of screening is that itÃ¢ÂÂs a great way to get more patients,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Gilbert Welch, professor of medicine at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy  Clinical Practice and a close observer of the task forceÃ¢ÂÂs work. Ã¢ÂÂThe financial underpinnings are huge.Ã¢ÂÂ The health care industry spends more money lobbying Congress than almost any other sector, according to the tracking site OpenSecrets. org. Price, an orthopedic surgeon, took in $479, 000 in health professional donations in the 2016 campaign cycle, one of the largest sums to any member of Congress. To be sure, the industry has a host of more pressing concerns, from the ACA and Medicare and Medicaid to the cost of drugs. But the task forceÃ¢ÂÂs recommendations have continued to draw complaints by lawmakers who received financial support from the industry. In November, lawmakers bashed its screening recommendations during a hearing of the health subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The task force Ã¢ÂÂcan deprive patients of lifesaving services,Ã¢ÂÂ said Rep. Michael Burgess, a Republican from Texas who received nearly $611, 000 from health professionals in the 2016 campaign cycle. His colleague, Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican who received $259, 000 in donations from health professionals in the 2016 campaign cycle, predicted equally dire outcomes. The task force, she said, Ã¢ÂÂturned its back on over 20 million women by finalizing erroneous guidelines that would limit access to mammograms.Ã¢ÂÂ Earlier this month, Blackburn   legislation that would, among other things, add specialists to the panel. The group currently consults with specialists in the areas they are reviewing. Critics of the proposed bill say specialists are not ideal to perform the task forceÃ¢ÂÂs broad array of evidence reviews, and adding them could create conflicts of interest. Ã¢ÂÂThere is considerable support for Ã¢ÂÂdraining the swampÃ¢ÂÂ in Washington,Ã¢ÂÂ Welch wrote in testimony he submitted for the hearing. Ã¢ÂÂBut there is no swamp currently in the task force. Please donÃ¢ÂÂt create one.Ã¢ÂÂ Questions sent to PriceÃ¢ÂÂs office were answered by Ryan Murphy, who is currently an HHS adviser. Murphy was most recently communications director for the House Budget Committee, of which Price is chairman. Ã¢ÂÂDr. PriceÃ¢ÂÂs concerns  Ã¢ÂÂ   shared by others as you noted  Ã¢ÂÂ   were with specific recommendations made by the task force,Ã¢ÂÂ Murphy said. Ã¢ÂÂAs a physician, Dr. Price knows firsthand the value of scientific research as well as how important it is to ensure patients and their doctors are able to make choices regarding treatments that they agree are in the best interest of the individual patient.Ã¢ÂÂ Price has embraced task force findings that recommend more treatment. In 2014, for example, he   a letter to the HHS secretary and the Medicare administrator asking that Medicare expand its coverage for lung cancer screenings for smokers based on task force recommendations. With the shifts in power both in Congress and under the Trump administration, proponents of the task force fear setbacks in the   push for   medicine. The task force has 96 current recommendations, which it routinely updates. Its $11. 6 million budget is funded through HHSÃ¢ÂÂs Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which has been on the lawmakersÃ¢ÂÂ chopping block in the past. If confirmed, Price or congressional Republicans could reduce the task forceÃ¢ÂÂs influence or independence, or cut its funding. Ã¢ÂÂScience is really under attack,Ã¢ÂÂ said Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂve spent decades building a scientific and research infrastructure and community all in order to produce the evidence that will save lives. Sometimes the science doesnÃ¢ÂÂt give us the answer we would like, but it actually gives us the facts and the evidence.Ã¢ÂÂ While some disagree with the task forceÃ¢ÂÂs recommendations, its work is in line with a global push toward   medicine and with the guidelines of some other groups. The International Agency for Research on Cancer says there isnÃ¢ÂÂt enough evidence to recommend for or against mammograms for women between 40 and 49. Like the task force, the American College of Physicians says mammograms should be an individual decision for women between the ages of 40 and 49 and be provided every other year at the patientÃ¢ÂÂs request. The task force and others found widespread screening often led to false positives, painful biopsies and   operations for patients who were not actually at risk of cancer. Unnecessary screening also contributes to an overtreatment epidemic that the Institute of Medicine has estimated costs $210 billion a year. Dr. Kirsten   chairwoman of the task force, is a internist and epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco. She said the attacks by Blackburn and others risk misleading patients about the effectiveness of screening for patients who are not at risk and are free of symptoms. Ã¢ÂÂPatients and clinicians need to understand the benefits and the harms so they are empowered to make the best decisions for themselves,Ã¢ÂÂ   said. Regardless of what happens politically, she said, patients and doctors will still need   recommendations to make informed decisions. The   work of the task force could be Ã¢ÂÂendangeredÃ¢ÂÂ because the panel is caught up in the political fight around the ACA, said Dr. Sheldon Greenfield executive   of the Health Policy Research Institute at the University of California, Irvine. Ã¢ÂÂIt wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt surprise me if it does become a casualty.Ã¢ÂÂ The worst outcome, he said, would be for health care in the United States to revert to the way it used to be. The old joke is that doctors ignore science and say, Ã¢ÂÂI know best,Ã¢ÂÂ Greenfield said, trumping   medicine with Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ medicine.

2213,"Women with breast cancer who are at high risk for having a BRCA mutation that raises cancer risk often donÃ¢ÂÂt get genetic testing, or even a chance to speak with a genetic counselor whoÃ¢ÂÂd help them weigh the necessity of such a test, a study finds. Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers, and women with close relatives who have had those cancers are considered at higher risk of having BRCA mutations themselves. Both the National Cancer Institute and the United States Preventative Task Force recommend that those patients talk to a genetic counselor about whether or not to get the BRCA test. But the study that surveyed newly diagnosed breast cancer patients found that while 80. 9 percent of   patients wanted testing, only 39. 6 percent had had a counseling session, and 50. 9 percent had a genetic test. The test results could help guide treatment, as well as future efforts to prevent more cancer. When asked why they didnÃ¢ÂÂt get tested, the majority of the 773   patients said it was because their doctor didnÃ¢ÂÂt recommend it to them. Just 13. 7 percent of them said the test was too expensive, and 10. 7 percent said they didnÃ¢ÂÂt want it. The researchers say this suggests a disconnect between oncologist and patient, whether it be assessing BRCA risk isnÃ¢ÂÂt on the physicianÃ¢ÂÂs radar, or that they just donÃ¢ÂÂt find it important. The study surveyed 2, 529 women overall. Ã¢ÂÂThose numbers were really striking to us,Ã¢ÂÂ says Allison Kurian, an associate professor of medicine and health   at Stanford University, breast cancer doctor, and lead author on the study, which was published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association. Ã¢ÂÂThis really emphasizes the importance of cancer doctors in this process, and that patients get evaluated and tested the way they should be.Ã¢ÂÂ Kurian notes that the study only got the patient side of the story, not the physician side, so itÃ¢ÂÂs unfair to assume the doctors are the sole cause of this disconnect. But by making genetic tests and counselors more available to patients at risk for BRCA, and making physicians more aware of the mutationsÃ¢ÂÂ implications, the gap between the need for and accessibility of genetic testing in these   patients will shrink, she says. Hospitals need to make sure breast cancer patients are screened for BRCA if they need it, says C. Anthony Ã¢ÂÂTonyÃ¢ÂÂ Blau, a professor of hematology at the University of Washington who specializes in breast cancer and was not involved with the study. The screening shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be on the patient or the oncologist, he says, but rather Ã¢ÂÂit should be part of the system. Hospital administrators donÃ¢ÂÂt typically do things that save patientsÃ¢ÂÂ lives, but this could be one of those things.Ã¢ÂÂ Testing for the genes even when patients are already diagnosed with breast cancer and are at high risk for BRCA can be helpful, says Kurian. Ã¢ÂÂKnowing a patient has BRCA1 or 2 affects how we treat the cancer she has,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. Ã¢ÂÂWe might give her different medications or different surgery options.Ã¢ÂÂ That knowledge can also help physicians keep an eye out for ovarian cancer, which occurs 11 to 17 percent more often in women with BRCA mutations and is difficult to diagnose early. It also lets oncologists keep an eye out for new cancers and treat them more effectively. Ã¢ÂÂCancers sneak up on you,Ã¢ÂÂ Kurian says. If a woman is flagged during BRCA screening due to her family history, Ã¢ÂÂfinding out she has a BRCA gene would let us start screening her as early as 25 years old. If we do find a really tiny cancer, sheÃ¢ÂÂll probably do a lot better and need less therapy in the long run.Ã¢ÂÂ And because the BRCA mutations have a    chance of being passed down from parent to child, a patient carrying BRCA1 or BRCA2 is likely to pass it down to further generations as well. In screening breast cancer patients for BRCA risk, Ã¢ÂÂthe implications arenÃ¢ÂÂt only for the patient presently affected by breast cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ Blau says, Ã¢ÂÂbut for their families and generations of descendants. The potential impact is enormous, and missing the opportunity to test for it is a big deal.Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,Women With Breast Cancer Miss Out On Recommended Genetic Testing ,2213.0,2213.0,213.0,
2214,"ItÃ¢ÂÂs no surprise that most women with breast cancer consider hair loss one of the most traumatic aspects of chemotherapy. That has led to a big market for cooling caps, which are purported to limit hair loss. But cooling caps havenÃ¢ÂÂt been extensively studied in the U. S. and womensÃ¢ÂÂ experiences with the caps have been hit or miss. And just one cooling cap, the DigniCap, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Two studies released Tuesday show that at least half the women who used either the DigniCap or another scalp cooling system, the Paxman, lost less than 50 percent of their hair. Ã¢ÂÂThese findings appear to represent a major step forward in improving the quality of life of individuals with cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ says Dr. Dawn Hershman, who studies the effects of cancer treatments at the Columbia University School of Medicine in New York. She wrote an editorial accompanying the studies in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association. But Hershman cautions that more study is needed to determine whether there is psychological benefit in using the caps to prevent hair loss. And the cost and who will pay for the treatment are also issues, she says. The average cost is $1, 500 to $3, 000, depending on the number of chemotherapy cycles. In the DigniCap study, 67 of 106 women (66. 3 percent) lost less than half their hair after four rounds of taxane chemotherapy. The women had either stage I or II breast cancer. In contrast, all of the 16 women who did not use the cap lost all of their hair during chemotherapy. The DigniCap system uses a double cap fitted to the scalp 30 minutes before an infusion, which keeps the scalp at 37 degrees Fahrenheit, plus or minus 2 degrees, during the session. The system was approved by the FDA in 2015 and is available at infusion centers in 17 states. The other study found similar results using the Paxman system. It was led by oncologist Julie Nangia of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. Half of the 95 women (50. 5 percent) using the Paxman system lost less than half their hair after four rounds of anthracycline and taxane chemotherapy, including five women who had no significant hair loss, as judged by independent observers from photographs. Among the 47 who did not use the cooling system, all lost all of their hair. The Paxman study was stopped earlier than planned, after four cycles of chemotherapy, because findings showed the cooling cap was highly effective at preventing hair loss. That cooling system is not yet available commercially in the U. S. and is under review at the FDA. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs nice now to have two good studies focusing on the quality of life to make the cancer journey easier for women,Ã¢ÂÂ Nangia tells NPR. There were no serious side effects related to either cooler. A few people reported headaches, and some stopped using the device because they got too cold. Nangia says most patients described the device as Ã¢ÂÂreasonably comfortable.Ã¢ÂÂ The studies were funded and designed, in part, by their respective manufacturers, with varying levels of company input to the university investigators. In both cases, the researchers were free to publish results they deemed appropriate. Researchers donÃ¢ÂÂt know exactly how the cooling caps work. One theory is that cooling constricts the blood vessels in the scalp, slowing the circulation and thereby reducing the amount of toxins to which hair follicles are exposed. Or it may be that cold slows the growth of hair follicles, making them less susceptible to damage from chemotherapy, which targets rapidly dividing cells. Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, says it could be that Ã¢ÂÂby slowing down those cells whatever mechanism it may be  Ã¢ÂÂ   either starving their blood flow or slowing them down straightforwardly  Ã¢ÂÂ   the net effect is beneficial, causing hair not to fall out.Ã¢ÂÂ While chilling the scalp may seem to carry few risks, Lichtenfeld says there is a theoretical risk that inhibiting the effect of chemotherapy in the scalp could allow metastases to take hold there. Ã¢ÂÂThese techniques are relatively new,Ã¢ÂÂ he says, and Ã¢ÂÂbreast cancer is a disease that can take a long time before it comes back and if one is to be 100 percent certain then you need a long period of time to answer the question.Ã¢ÂÂ So far, cancer recurrence on the scalp has not been seen in the U. S. studies, but authors of both JAMA papers say longer   is needed to be sure that this is not a risk.",cancer,Cooling Cap May Limit Chemo Hair Loss In Women With Breast Cancer,2214.0,2214.0,214.0,
2215,"The best way to diagnose a strange skin bump is often to decide what itÃ¢ÂÂs not. So say the researchers who have devised a mnemonic device useful for determining that the lesion or lump isnÃ¢ÂÂt a bite from a brown recluse spider  Ã¢ÂÂ   a diagnosis that can be very common and very false, they say. Around 40 conditions have been or could be misdiagnosed as a nibble from the brown recluse, including Lyme disease, herpes,   staph infection, diabetic ulcers and skin cancer. You wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt want to miss out on treatment for any of those things because the doctor said you had a spider bite. And the brown recluseÃ¢ÂÂs venom can cause serious wounds or kidney failure, so isnÃ¢ÂÂt to be trifled with, either. The aptly named mnemonic NOT RECLUSE could help limit misdiagnoses and make sure people get the right treatment. It stands for things that would not be a factor if a patient was bitten by a brown recluse, like numerous bites (N) the circumstances where the wound occurred (O) or the time of year it came about (T). Tally two or more NOT RECLUSE symptoms, and the brown recluse explanation should be thrown out, the researchers suggest in their JAMA Dermatology paper. Brown recluse bites have a reputation for causing pus and rotting flesh, so many people assume theyÃ¢ÂÂve been bitten if they have a nasty wound. But only 10 percent of the bites ever need medical attention. In the most serious cases, skin turns black and starts to die in whatÃ¢ÂÂs called skin necrosis. If you know youÃ¢ÂÂve been bitten for sure, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends seeking immediate medical attention and to bring the spider with you for identification. Most typically, though, a bite from the spider looks like a pimple or a small white blister and heals on its own over a month or two. And the spiders, just larger than a penny, wonÃ¢ÂÂt bite unless threatened. One woman even trapped over 2, 000 of the arachnids in her own house over a   span, and no one in her family was ever known to have been bitten. Many people   another skin condition as a brown recluse bite because Ã¢ÂÂitÃ¢ÂÂs a sexy diagnosis,Ã¢ÂÂ says Rick Vetter, a retired entomologist of the University of California, Riverside, a brown recluse expert and   on the study. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs like saying you were bitten by a rattlesnake. ItÃ¢ÂÂs dramatic. Bacterial infections? Not so much.Ã¢ÂÂ These   even happen outside the brown recluseÃ¢ÂÂs range of Southern and central Midwestern states in the U. S. Physicians tend to falsely diagnose brown recluse bites, Vetter says, because Ã¢ÂÂitÃ¢ÂÂs a really comfortable scapegoat. People want a diagnosis. Doctors want to give them a diagnosis.Ã¢ÂÂ So if physicians canÃ¢ÂÂt figure out the identity of an ambiguous bump, they jump to spider bite. Vetter worked with two dermatologists on the paper they hope that physicians will make use of NOT RECLUSE to ensure that patients get the right treatments. Ã¢ÂÂWhen we see people with cancer or MRSA who get this false diagnosis,Ã¢ÂÂ Vetter says, Ã¢ÂÂit really drives home that you canÃ¢ÂÂt just call everything a recluse bite.Ã¢ÂÂ Eager for the whole mnemonic? Here you go. More than two of these would typically exclude a brown recluse spider bite: Numerous: More than one injury, Occurrence: Not in a secluded area like a box, closet or attic, Timing: The wound arose sometime between November and March, Red Center: The center of the wound is red, Elevated: The middle of the wound is elevated, not sunken, Chronic: The wound has persisted for more than three months, Large: The injury is more than 10 centimeters wide, Ulcerates Too Early: The injury gets crusty within the first week, Swollen: The wound swells up if itÃ¢ÂÂs below the neck, Exudative: The wound is Ã¢ÂÂwet,Ã¢ÂÂ oozing pus or clear fluid",cancer,Is That A Brown Recluse Spider Bite Or Skin Cancer? ,2215.0,2215.0,215.0,
2216,"One of the great treats of following an Agatha Christie mystery (my favorite being Hercule Poirot) is that you know there will be an Ã¢ÂÂAha!Ã¢ÂÂ moment at the end. The fastidious, mustachioed detective will pull together all the disparate facts and present a compelling answer. IÃ¢ÂÂm frequently reminded that science doesnÃ¢ÂÂt work that way. The latest case in point is an article published Tuesday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute that sets out to explore a trend in colorectal cancer among younger Americans. More than a decade ago, scientists noticed an odd quirk in the data: While overall rates of colorectal cancer have been falling dramatically since the   thereÃ¢ÂÂs been a steady uptick of this disease among people younger than 50. The numbers are small. Cancer incidence is creeping up by 1 or 2 cases per 100, 000 people under 50. By way of comparison, the disease rate among older Americans has plummeted by more than 100 cases per 100, 000 people. And the vast majority of colorectal cancer cases are among people over 50: These older Americans are 16 times more likely to get colon cancer, compared with adults who are younger. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why a small trend in younger adults is far outweighed by the dramatic decrease of disease among people over 50. Still, the   will eventually grow older. What will happen to their risk then? Will the trends that started in their 20s and 30s continue? If thatÃ¢ÂÂs the case, overall colorectal cancer rates might ultimately end their steady decline, and could start to rise. Another possibility is that, once people turn 50, they will follow the current medical guidance and get colonoscopies or other recommended screening tests, which can actually prevent colorectal cancer by finding and removing precancerous polyps. And their risk profile could end up looking much like it does today. HereÃ¢ÂÂs where even Poirot would be stumped. There simply isnÃ¢ÂÂt enough information to know what will happen. Epidemiologist Rebecca Siegel and her colleagues at the American Cancer Society have published their take in the JNCI. In their study, they break down the population into generational cohorts, focusing on millennials and members of Generation X. By breaking down the cases by age group, Siegel says, itÃ¢ÂÂs easier to disentangle generational changes such as differences in diet from trends in medical diagnosis and treatment, which vary less by age. Still, she and her colleagues can only say so much. Ã¢ÂÂ[T]he results do not provide any direct evidence about the role of specific exposures or interventions,Ã¢ÂÂ they note in the study. Even so, the researchers say, because trends in the young Ã¢ÂÂcould be a bellwether of the future disease burden, our results are sobering.Ã¢ÂÂ Siegel tells Shots, Ã¢ÂÂIt appears that under the surface, the underlying risk for this disease is actually increasing in the population.Ã¢ÂÂ WhatÃ¢ÂÂs driving that is hard to say. Obesity is more common among younger than it used to be, so perhaps itÃ¢ÂÂs partly to blame. Or it may not be obesity itself it could be that poor diet and lack of exercise, which contribute to obesity, are also influencing colon cancer rates. One study found that people from Africa who were suddenly switched to an American diet had signs of inflammation in their colons within just two weeks, Siegel notes, Ã¢ÂÂso this change can happen fairly rapidly.Ã¢ÂÂ But thatÃ¢ÂÂs far from a complete explanation. A large British study published a few years ago suggested that only 11 percent of colon cancer cases could be tied to trends in obesity. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs also a scenario in which this seemingly glum cancer trend is in fact good news. Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, a professor of medicine at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy  Clinical Practice, says what look like additional cancers in people under 50 may simply be cases that are being diagnosed earlier than they would have been. Some people are getting colonoscopies for reasons other than cancer screening these days, and doctors are surely coming upon early cases of colon cancer they might not have turned up so soon. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs some evidence to back that claim: While the rate of new cases of colorectal cancer has been climbing in   Americans since the   the death rate among that group has remained remarkably flat. And death rates may be the more telling statistic. Something similar happened with breast cancer in the 1980s  Ã¢ÂÂ   there was a temporary spike in the number of breast cancers diagnosed, as large numbers of women went in for mammography screening for the first time. But death rates didnÃ¢ÂÂt rise, and incidence rates of breast cancers fell again after that uptick. Welch notes that weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing that again with the rates of thyroid cancer, which are skyrocketing due to intensive screening and diagnosis but, again, thereÃ¢ÂÂs been no increase in mortality from thyroid tumors. Welch offers yet another possibility: Maybe the apparent rise in colon cancer among young people is real, but it wonÃ¢ÂÂt affect them as they age. Ã¢ÂÂThe biology of the disease may be different between the young and the old,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Welch himself has explored the much larger trend of declining colorectal cancer rates. Some of it is no doubt caused by vastly increased screening for colorectal cancer, though he notes that the decline was well under way before colonoscopies became routine. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no question that diet and other factors can also have a profound effect on cancer rates. Ã¢ÂÂOne of the most dramatic cases of that is stomach cancer, which used to be a very common cause of cancer and has now virtually disappeared, at least in the United States,Ã¢ÂÂ Welch tells Shots. On one point there is broad agreement among doctors and researchers treating and studying this disease: The increased screening for colorectal cancer, which can involve removing polyps before they become cancer, has been a significant factor in reducing the burden of this illness. Another point of agreement: If the Trump administration eliminates the current insurance benefit for colon cancer screening as it does away with the Affordable Care Act, fewer people are likely to get screened for this deadly malignancy. And the likely impact of that is not a mystery. You can contact Richard Harris at rharris@npr. org.",cancer,Why Are More Young Americans Getting Colon Cancer? ,2216.0,2216.0,216.0,
2217,"Women with breast cancer sometimes get confusing messages about   foods, including soy milk, edamame and tofu. On one hand, studies have suggested that the   compounds in soy  Ã¢ÂÂ   called isoflavones  Ã¢ÂÂ   may inhibit the development or recurrence of breast cancer. On the other hand, thereÃ¢ÂÂs been concern that consuming   foods can interfere with the effectiveness of breast cancer drugs such as tamoxifen. A new study helps to resolve this question. Ã¢ÂÂOur finding would suggest that soy food consumption does not have a harmful effect,Ã¢ÂÂ says Fang Fang Zhang, a cancer epidemiologist at Tufts University. And for some breast cancer survivors, soy seems beneficial. The study tied higher soy consumption to a longer life after breast cancer, especially for women with hormone receptor negative breast cancers  Ã¢ÂÂ   which tend to be aggressive, and donÃ¢ÂÂt respond to hormone therapy. Ã¢ÂÂWe found a 21 percent reduction in   mortality among women with the highest dietary intake [of soy] compared to those with the lowest intake,Ã¢ÂÂ Zhang told us. The findings are based on a study of 6, 235 women with breast cancer in the United States and Canada, all of whom were enrolled in the Breast Cancer Family Registry. The women completed   questionnaires, so researchers could estimate how much soy they consumed. This benefit of better survival odds was limited to women in the study with hormone   cancers. The researchers found no associations for   women who had hormone   tumors or those who received hormone therapy. Research in Asian women has shown that soy can protect against breast cancer. And a 2009 study that included 5, 000 Chinese breast cancer survivors concluded that those who consumed the most soy did better in the four years following diagnosis and treatment. Zhang says that given the evidence from Asia, she wasnÃ¢ÂÂt surprised to see a benefit for women in North America, too. Her findings are published in the journal Cancer. In an accompanying editorial, Omer Kucuk,  an oncologist who has studied nutrition and cancer prevention at the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, argues that the new data helps answer the question of whether soy is safe for women. Ã¢ÂÂWe now have evidence that soy foods not only prevent breast cancer but also benefit women who have breast cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ Kucuk concludes. But there are some limitations to the study. For instance, researchers point out that the women who consumed more soy in their study also tended to have higher incomes and healthier lifestyles, factors that can also influence longevity. And there are other unanswered questions, according to Marian Neuhouser, a registered dietician and nutritional epidemiologist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. She says the data from the new study is Ã¢ÂÂa piece of the puzzle.Ã¢ÂÂ She points out that the amount of soy isoflavones that the North American women in the study consumed was quite small  Ã¢ÂÂ   less than 2 milligrams a day. Ã¢ÂÂIf you compare that to Asian populations that on average consume 40 to 50 milligrams, itÃ¢ÂÂs pretty low,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. She says itÃ¢ÂÂs not clear what the results  Ã¢ÂÂ   in terms of   survival  Ã¢ÂÂ   would be if women in the U. S. consumed a lot more. For now, she says Ã¢ÂÂsoy seems to be safeÃ¢ÂÂ at the levels women in the U. S. typically consume it, Ã¢ÂÂand it could be beneficial for some women who have had a diagnosis of breast cancer.Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,"For Breast Cancer Survivors, Eating Soy Tied To A Longevity Boost",2217.0,2217.0,217.0,
2218,"Two years ago, a U. N.  scientific agency declared that the popular weedkiller glyphosate probably causes cancer. That finding from the International Agency for Research on Cancer caused an international uproar. Monsanto, the company that invented glyphosate and still sells most of it, unleashed a fierce campaign to discredit the IARCÃ¢ÂÂs conclusions. New details of the companyÃ¢ÂÂs counterattack came to light this week. Internal company emails, released as part of a lawsuit against the company, show how Monsanto recruited outside scientists to   reports defending the safety of glyphosate, sold under the brand name Roundup. Monsanto executive William Heydens proposed that the company Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ one paper. In an email, Heydens wrote that Ã¢ÂÂwe would be keeping the cost down by us doing the writing and they would just edit  sign their names so to speak.Ã¢ÂÂ Heydens wrote that this is how Monsanto had Ã¢ÂÂhandledÃ¢ÂÂ an earlier paper on glyphosateÃ¢ÂÂs safety. That earlier paper, published in 2000, acknowledges MonsantoÃ¢ÂÂs help in assembling the data, but does not list any Monsanto employees as  . The emails also offer hints of a friendly relationship between Monsanto and a senior regulator at the Environmental Protection Agency, Jess Rowland. The EPA was already doing its own assessment of glyphosateÃ¢ÂÂs health risks, but after the U. N. report appeared, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention apparently was considering launching its own study. In late April, 2015, Rowland called a regulatory expert at Monsanto, Daniel Jenkins, to ask who at the CDC was working on the glyphosate study. Jenkins reported on the conversation in an email to his colleagues. He wrote that Rowland Ã¢ÂÂtold me no coordination is going on and he wanted to establish some saying Ã¢ÂÂIf I can kill this I should get a medal.Ã¢ÂÂ In a separate email in September, 2015, Jenkins wrote that Ã¢ÂÂJess will be retiring from EPA in ~5 Ã¢ÂÂ  6 months and could be useful as we move forward with ongoing glyphosate defense.Ã¢ÂÂ Rowland has since retired from the EPA. The documents were collected as evidence in a lawsuit that a group of cancer victims have brought against Monsanto in California. Lawyers for the plaintiffs are arguing that Monsanto executives colluded with officials at the EPA to downplay glyphosateÃ¢ÂÂs health risks. The EPA concluded last fall that glyphosate is unlikely to cause cancer. Other scientific groups have come to similar conclusions, including a committee from the European Food Safety Agency, another U. N. agency, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and just today, the European Chemical Agency, ECHA.",cancer,Emails Reveal MonsantoÃ¢ÂÂs Tactics To Defend Glyphosate Against Cancer Fears,2218.0,2218.0,218.0,
2219,"The Food and Drug Administration says at least nine women have died of a rare blood cancer after receiving breast implants, and that the agency is officially acknowledging an association between the implants and the disease. On Tuesday, the agency announced that as of Feb. 1, it had received 359 breast   reports of a rare type of  Ã¢ÂÂs lymphoma called anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or ALCL. The cancers were more common in women who had implants with textured, rather than smooth, surfaces. About 290, 000 people received breast implants in the U. S. last year, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, which does not track the surface textures of implants in its yearly reports. Of the 359 cases reported to the FDA, 231 had information on the types of implants. Of those, 28 of the cancers were in women who received breast implants with smooth surfaces and 203 were in women who had a version with a textured surface. It is still unclear whether the texturing is actually responsible for the cancer, or is just associated with a higher incidence of the disease. The surfaces of the textured implants are designed to allow tissue to grow around the interstices of the implant surface, explains Dhivya Srinivasa, a plastic surgery resident at the University of Michigan and the lead author on a recent review of data on breast   ALCL worldwide. The texturing can help prevent a surgical complication called capsular contracture, where the scar tissue around the implant becomes hard and painful. Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂs many kinds of texturing, and different companies do it differently,Ã¢ÂÂ Srinivasa says, so itÃ¢ÂÂs difficult to know what specific quality of textured implants could be associated with the cancer. Doctors and researchers have been investigating a connection between breast implants and ALCL for years. The FDA first reported on it back in 2011, but did not cite any reports of deaths from the disease and said there were too few cases to conclude anything beyond a Ã¢ÂÂpossible association between breast implants and ALCL.Ã¢ÂÂ Since then, the Plastic Surgery Foundation has launched a reporting system specifically for doctors to report cases of the disease in implant patients. Last year, the World Health Organization classified breast   ALCL as a separate diagnosis, and authorities in Australia and France took steps to track and assess the connection. A study published earlier this year estimated the lifetime prevalence of ALCL in people with textured implants is 33 per 1 million persons. That rate is about 65 times higher than the overall risk of developing ALCL if you do not have breast implants. Women choose to get receive breast implants for multiple reasons, including to replace tissue removed as a result of breast cancer or during cosmetic surgery to make breasts larger or change their shape. More women with breast cancer are choosing to have mastectomies rather than   procedures that leave part of the breast intact. But as NPRÃ¢ÂÂs Patty Neighmond has reported, there is evidence that a full mastectomy with reconstruction Ã¢ÂÂis more costly and has more complications after surgery than lumpectomy with   irradiation, while the rate of cancer recurrence and survival is essentially the same under both regimens.Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,Breast Implants Linked To Rare Blood Cancer In Small Proportion Of Women,2219.0,2219.0,219.0,
2220,"Cancer can be caused by tobacco smoke or by an inherited trait, but new research finds that most of the mutations that lead to cancer crop up naturally. The authors of the study published Thursday poked a hornetÃ¢ÂÂs nest by suggesting that many cancers are unavoidable. The provocative findings by Bert Vogelstein and Cristian Tomasetti at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, have stirred up a heated scientific debate that started two years ago, when they published a report along similar lines. Back then, critics said they were undercutting important messages about cancer prevention. So when these scientists had new results to report, Vogelstein addressed that concern  . Ã¢ÂÂWe all agree that 40 percent of cancers are preventable,Ã¢ÂÂ he said at a news conference. Ã¢ÂÂThe question is, what about the other cancers that arenÃ¢ÂÂt known to be preventable?Ã¢ÂÂ Vogelstein, who is also an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, explained how he and Tomasetti have refined that question. He notes that every time a perfectly normal cell divides, it makes several mistakes when it copies its DNA. These are naturally occurring mutations. Most of the time, those mutations are in unimportant bits of DNA. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs good luck. Ã¢ÂÂBut occasionally they occur in a cancer driver gene. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs bad luck,Ã¢ÂÂ Vogelstein says. After two or three of these driver genes get mutated in the same cell, they can transform that healthy cell into a cancer cell. In their new paper in Science, the researchers set out to quantify how often those random errors are an inevitable part of cell division, how often theyÃ¢ÂÂre caused by nasty chemicals like tobacco smoke and how often theyÃ¢ÂÂre inherited. The answer: 66 percent of the total mutations are random, about 29 percent are due to the environment and the remaining five percent are due to heredity. These numbers vary depending on the type of cancer, they found. Lung cancer is largely the result of environmental causes, while the vast majority of childhood cancer is a result of these   mutations, they found. Vogelstein says parents often think they, somehow, are responsible for their childÃ¢ÂÂs cancer, but that is not the case. Ã¢ÂÂThey need to understand that these cancers would have happened no matter what they did,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Ã¢ÂÂWe donÃ¢ÂÂt need to add guilt to an already tragic situation.Ã¢ÂÂ Of course, people can reduce their risk of preventable cancer by avoiding tobacco, eating well and maintaining a healthy body weight. But the bad news is that most mutations arise naturally. So, what can people do? Ã¢ÂÂNothing. Right now, nothing,Ã¢ÂÂ Vogelstein says. But, heÃ¢ÂÂs hopeful that if scientists focus on that question, they will have a more encouraging answer someday. Even without an action plan, the question of how much human cancer is caused by bad luck and how much is caused by bad things we do Ã¢ÂÂis super fascinating,Ã¢ÂÂ says Martin Nowak, a biologist and mathematician at Harvard who wrote a commentary about the study for Science. He says the findings are stirring up the field, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs a good thing. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs very unclear to me about whether we have the tools to answer these questions,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. And, rather than settling the controversy raised by the scientistsÃ¢ÂÂ previous paper, Ã¢ÂÂI think it will raise an even bigger controversy,Ã¢ÂÂ Nowak says. One of the new sticking points is that mutations, while necessary for cancer to develop, arenÃ¢ÂÂt the whole story. For example, some scientists say the study doesnÃ¢ÂÂt fully account for how hormones can influence cancer. Dr. Graham Colditz, an epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis isnÃ¢ÂÂt convinced that hazards can been neatly sorted into the categories of hereditary, environmental and unavoidable mutations. Ã¢ÂÂHow these interplay with each other, I think is potentially more complex,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Vogelstein and Tomasetti agree on that point. The causes of cancer are complex. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre not saying the only thing that determines the seriousness of the cancer, or its aggressiveness, or its likelihood to cause the patientÃ¢ÂÂs death, are these mutations,Ã¢ÂÂ Vogelstein tells Shots. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre simply saying that they are necessary to get the cancer.Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,"Cancer Is Partly Caused By Bad Luck, Study Finds",2220.0,2220.0,220.0,
2221,"Undergoing treatment for cancer is hard enough by itself. And for many cancer patients who spend most of their time in a hospital, it gets even harder with the loss of basic comforts. The hospitalÃ¢ÂÂs sterile environment, the fluorescent lights and the disposable gowns do little to make medical treatment more bearable. Nikla Lancksweert, wanted to do a little something to help with that dehumanizing experience, focusing on an alternative for those uncomfortable hospital gowns. Lancksweert is   of INGA Wellbeing, which creates   clothing for patients. The    entrepreneur whoÃ¢ÂÂs originally from the U. K, lived in Philadelphia for several years before moving to Brussels, Belgium, where sheÃ¢ÂÂs now based. She named the clothing line, INGA, in honor of her mom, who was diagnosed of ovarian cancer at the age of 52 and then underwent three years of intense medical treatment. Ã¢ÂÂDuring this time she often had to put on a hospital gown or sit in her underwear to be examined or treated by strangers,Ã¢ÂÂ Lancksweert says on her Website. Ã¢ÂÂIt was sad and worrying to see how my elegant, capable mother would, almost visibly, shrink. Be diminished. . .. Getting her out of the hospital gown and into clothes that looked Ã¢ÂÂnormalÃ¢ÂÂ but that really worked became my obsession!Ã¢ÂÂ LancksweertÃ¢ÂÂs mom died on Boxing Day, 2006. And a few years later, Lancksweert got the idea to create the clothing line. She teamed up with former public relations executive, Claire Robinson  Ã¢ÂÂ   whose mom was also a cancer patient  Ã¢ÂÂ   and fashion designer Fiona McGreal and in January this year, they officially launched the full collection of INGA Wellbeing. INGA Wellbeing offers worldwide shipping and in Belgium and the U. K. the collection is also available via a few specialist online and bricks and mortar retailers. In its short existence, INGA has won awards for health innovation and   among them Henry van de Velde, Janey Loves Platinum and Healthcare Think Tank. NPRÃ¢ÂÂs Lulu   spoke with Lancksweert, who endorses the sentiment, Ã¢ÂÂINGA Wellbeing makes it possible to dress Ã¢ÂÂwellÃ¢ÂÂ even when unwell,Ã¢ÂÂ about the motivation behind her brand and how sheÃ¢ÂÂs helping patients feel more comfortable and dignified   as they battle cancer. On how her road to create fashionable hospital clothing began with her mother  My mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer when she was just 52 years old and suddenly plunged into the world of hospitals and medical treatment. And it was really notable to see how very quickly she lost her dignity. And itÃ¢ÂÂs not intentionally so. Doctors and nurses certainly have every intention of being as respectful as they can of patients. ItÃ¢ÂÂs just if youÃ¢ÂÂre wearing the wrong clothes then you have to be helped to dress and undress. Then you might not want to go for a walk, which means you end up sort of staying in your room and you become sort of institutionalized incredibly quickly.  On how she actually happened to start the clothing line, I was lucky enough to meet Claire Robinson whose own mother had breast cancer and who was experiencing much of the same issues that my mother had gone through. And then we realized that we needed to have somebody with real fashion design skills and not just determination. And so, we were lucky enough to meet Fiona McGreal who wanted to help us come up with a set of designs that really work in hospital but that look completely normal. And that for us was the key thing. . .. we wanted to   health. On what has to be taken into consideration when designing clothing for patients, We worked with nurses to say, Ã¢ÂÂOK, which parts of the body do you need to be able to get to most frequently?Ã¢ÂÂ And so we came up with the women, we have a back opening dress, which is actually the closest thing to a hospital gown. But you would never guess it. IÃ¢ÂÂve worn it in the playground. IÃ¢ÂÂve worn it to the supermarket, often meetings  Ã¢ÂÂ   not having had a chance to change  Ã¢ÂÂ   but it has all that sort of ease of opening in that it opens at the back and it also has openings down the arms and an a very discreet opening to the stomach. On why itÃ¢ÂÂs important to have patients feeling better about the way that they look  If you feel   and therefore in charge of your medical treatment, then you are much more likely to want to get up and move around and ultimately recover faster and get home faster. This is the psychological element but thereÃ¢ÂÂs also a very physical aspect of it, which is if you donÃ¢ÂÂt do those things if you just stay in bed, thereÃ¢ÂÂs actually a higher risk of infection and you lose your muscle tone much more quickly, which makes walking ultimately harder. So your hospital stay becomes longer. On naming the fashion company after her mom and what she thinks her mom would think  I think she would be amazed. IÃ¢ÂÂve got nothing to do with the fashion world and I donÃ¢ÂÂt think IÃ¢ÂÂm known particularly for being fashionable. But I think she would be amazed. And in fact, Inga was my motherÃ¢ÂÂs name but itÃ¢ÂÂs only afterwards that I realized  Ã¢ÂÂ   looking it up  Ã¢ÂÂ   that actually means Ã¢ÂÂa heroÃ¢ÂÂs daughter.Ã¢ÂÂ And thatÃ¢ÂÂs very much how we feel, that this concept is in honor of the heroes in our life. And I hope brings a great deal of comfort and dignity to others and just break this vicious cycle that patients often find themselves in.

2222,"There is a whole range of feelings that happen with the delivery of bad news. In my case, like many others, knees lock, the heart speeds up and the hairs on my arms get a funny little tingle. My circumstances, however, were a little less expected. When my dad told my husband and me that he and my mom wanted to come into Manhattan for dinner, I was excited to see them and quickly made a plan for an 8 p. m. dinner at CafÃÂ© Orlin  Ã¢ÂÂ   my favorite for Middle Eastern food. As soon as we sat down, I knew something was very wrong. My mom had been in and out of breast cancer treatment for 15 years and had been managing and treating the disease like it was no big deal, even though she was just in her 50s. Were they about to tell us that the other shoe had dropped and she was dying? No, this time it was about my dad. He had stage 4 pancreatic cancer. My    world shook. We all knew what this meant. As a photojournalist, I did the only thing I knew: I picked up my camera and documented my parentsÃ¢ÂÂ dual cancer treatments for the next 24 months and our lives as they unfolded. From the   chemotherapy infusions to running errands with Mom according to her   lists, I was there with my camera slung across my shoulder. When I look back on the time I spent documenting these complicated months, I donÃ¢ÂÂt immediately remember feeling scared. I remember the    laughter,   dinners (as per the doctorÃ¢ÂÂs request, of course) the   dance parties in my parentsÃ¢ÂÂ kitchen and the   conversations over a cup of Chappaqua roast from Susan Lawrence Gourmet Foods and BeaÃ¢ÂÂs Bakery blueberry pie. Everyone deals with their fears, especially death, in their own way. My family leaned on humor to carry us through this difficult time. I remember one night sitting on my parentsÃ¢ÂÂ bathroom floor as my father began to cut off my motherÃ¢ÂÂs hair, which had become flat dreadlocks tightly knotted against her scalp. The chemo had stopped its growth, but she hadnÃ¢ÂÂt been ready to part with her hair for the third time  Ã¢ÂÂ   once with each cancer diagnosis. I remember cursing the universe, asking it to give my mom a break just this once. The next thing I knew, my mother jumped in front of me and my lens, discarded hair held to her face like eyebrows. A fashion show followed suit, as we all wore her hair as costume, including the dog! That she found the lightness and ability to find joy in this moment speaks to the tremendous woman she was. By confronting what I feared most, using my camera as my shield, I was able to move past the trauma that I anticipated and truly enjoy the time we had left together. Had I hidden away from the reality, I wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt have the beautiful photo of my parents holding hands across the chemo chairs as they received their respective treatments. They were the definition of strength and courage, and seeing these images reinforces to me the importance of not letting fear hold me back. It also reminds me to appreciate each day and not lose perspective. As Mom once told me, Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂs also life going on here. I am having marshmallows, you know!Ã¢ÂÂ Was it scary? Of course. When he died in 2013, my dad, Howie, was 58. My mom, Laurel, was 59 when she died one day shy of the anniversary of my dadÃ¢ÂÂs death. But what was most notable was how those final months were filled with love and life. Although my parents are gone, my siblings and I continue to feel their love and guidance, as we sift through decades of found letters and notes, including one small stack of   notes from our mother, exemplifying the importance of leaning into fear and taking chances: Courage isnÃ¢ÂÂt the absence of fear  Ã¢ÂÂ   itÃ¢ÂÂs knowing that you are afraid and doing it anyway. DonÃ¢ÂÂt spend your days avoiding risk, being fearful. Act. Live your life on your own terms. Life is precious spend it without regrets in your own precious voice. For my three angels: If you want to talk or feel my love, look up at the night sky  Ã¢ÂÂ   I am always watching over you. Nancy Borowick is a photojournalist based on the island of Guam. She has covered humanitarian stories for many organizations including The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN.

2223,"If you were worried you had cancer, who would you call for information? Chances are a   cancer helpline isnÃ¢ÂÂt the first place that pops into your mind. But for 40 years, a helpline funded primarily by the National Cancer Institute has been answering peopleÃ¢ÂÂs questions about cancer. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a source of information for people who have been called back for a   after routine screenings and are worried they might have cancer. And it can also help cancer patients get information about participating in clinical trials and help them figure out questions to ask their doctors. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle runs the Contact Center, which is funded mostly by the National Cancer Institute with some support from the VeteranÃ¢ÂÂs Administration. Last month, the NCI awarded Fred Hutch a $24 million,   contract to continue operating the helpline. Ã¢ÂÂThere will be about 1. 7 million Americans diagnosed with cancer this year. For many of them, access to good information can be the difference between life and death,Ã¢ÂÂ says Peter Garrett, a spokesperson for the National Cancer Institute. More than 91, 000 people reached out to the Contact Center via phone, email or social media in 2016  Ã¢ÂÂ   a total of about 250 inquiries per day. This year, more people have been contacting the center through a live chat, email or social media than with a phone call, says the centerÃ¢ÂÂs director, Nancy Gore. Ã¢ÂÂOver the years, call volume has declined although the complexity of the calls has increased,Ã¢ÂÂ says Gore. Ã¢ÂÂPeople seek information via the Internet, so [they] can often find answers to basic questions such as general cancer symptoms, a common call before the Internet became pervasive.Ã¢ÂÂ Now, people more often need technical information about clinical trials and gene therapies, she says. But the helpline remains relatively   by the general public. About 10 percent of those inquiries were from repeat clients, according to data provided by the center. Back in the 1980s, more than 20 cancer call centers operated around the country. Now thereÃ¢ÂÂs just one. Assuming that the cancer center spends about $8 million this year to handle a similar number of inquiries, by our very rough calculation that adds up to a cost of about $87. 14 per inquiry. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no limit on the amount of time a helpline staffer can spend on the phone with a client. Eric Suni, a cancer information specialist at the center, says he has occasionally spent more than an hour on the phone with a caller during the seven years heÃ¢ÂÂs worked there. Ã¢ÂÂSometimes people will call and say they have one quick question, but answering that one quick question requires a much more   discussion because you can only answer that question by explaining some other concept,Ã¢ÂÂ Suni says. Ã¢ÂÂEven those that seem like, oh, this should take two minutes to answer is actually a much more involved conversation. So you never really know until it actually starts to unfold.Ã¢ÂÂ Hotline staffers, who are required to have a   college degree, spend six to seven weeks in initial training. The center calls this process Ã¢ÂÂthe metamorphosis from civilian into a Cancer Information Specialist,Ã¢ÂÂ in a training overview document. ItÃ¢ÂÂs hard not to think that the call center had become less necessary in an era when people can Google symptoms and get advice in patient groups on Facebook, but Gore says thereÃ¢ÂÂs still a need. Ã¢ÂÂIn fact, it is such a common, common comment that is shared with us that they [the clients] wish they had known we were here when they were first diagnosed, or when their mother was diagnosed,Ã¢ÂÂ Gore says. GoreÃ¢ÂÂs husband died of melanoma when he was 34. She didnÃ¢ÂÂt know much about his disease at the time of his diagnosis, she says. Ã¢ÂÂUntil a cancer diagnosis is part of someoneÃ¢ÂÂs family or close friend situation people are aware of it, but until it hits home youÃ¢ÂÂre not that in tune to it,Ã¢ÂÂ Gore says. Ã¢ÂÂOnce it actually hits home, then people have intense interest and a thirst for knowledge because they want to understand.Ã¢ÂÂ Doctors may explain information to patients, but sometimes the shock of a cancer diagnosis can make it tough for a patient to focus. Ã¢ÂÂFor most people, you donÃ¢ÂÂt hear anything after the diagnosis. YouÃ¢ÂÂre just processing the words,Ã¢ÂÂ Gore says. The NCI estimates that about 4 in 10 people in the U. S. will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives, according to data from 2010 to 2012. Callers to the hotline ask most frequently about breast cancer, according to 2016 data, followed by other more common cancers including lung and prostate. And more people called with questions about a spouse, friend or relative than about themselves. The people who reach out to the center in English tend to be in their 50, 60s and 70s, but those who seek a conversation in Spanish are generally younger  Ã¢ÂÂ   most are in their 30s, 40s or 50s. Other sources of information about cancer also exist, such as a   hotline run by the American Cancer Society, which received about 744, 000 inquiries last year. Dr. Deanna Attai, a clinical professor of surgery at the University of California Los Angeles, participates in the weekly Breast Cancer Social Media chats known as #bcsm. She says she got involved after she noticed a Twitter conversation where a breast cancer patient was asking for treatment advice. Attai started a private conversation with the patient, offering her advice about reliable surgeons. She calls it her Twitter Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ moment. Ã¢ÂÂJust by stumbling across a conversation in the middle of the night, you could really have a big impact,Ã¢ÂÂ Attai says. Ã¢ÂÂThat was for me, when I started to realize where my voice is among the community, that I could act as kind of like a guide.Ã¢ÂÂ Attai doesnÃ¢ÂÂt see social media making the NCI Contact Center obsolete. Instead, the cancer institute could use social media to point people to the NCI as a source of    unbiased information. Ã¢ÂÂI think they should be using social media to promote themselves,Ã¢ÂÂ Attai says. Ã¢ÂÂPeople donÃ¢ÂÂt really understand what the NCI does, unless youÃ¢ÂÂre a researcher or physician or maybe someone thatÃ¢ÂÂs participated in a clinical trial.Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,Got Cancer Questions?

Over the next few years, he underwent rounds of chemotherapy and radiation, only to have the cancer return. Feeling helpless, Ryan turned to what he knew as a video game developer. He began working on a game as a way to understand and confront his sonÃ¢ÂÂs deteriorating health. He connected with the Kickstarter community, ultimately raising enough money to back the creation of the game, which made its debut Tuesday. It would have been JoelÃ¢ÂÂs sixth birthday. The result is That Dragon, Cancer, a deeply intimate, immersive video game that follows JoelÃ¢ÂÂs fight with cancer over four years. But itÃ¢ÂÂs not your typical    type of game.

2225,"If the advice to eat more fiber seems easy to ignore, youÃ¢ÂÂre not alone. Most Americans donÃ¢ÂÂt get the 25 to 38 grams a day thatÃ¢ÂÂs recommended, depending on age and gender. But if youÃ¢ÂÂre skimping on fiber, the health stakes are high, especially if youÃ¢ÂÂre a teenage girl. A study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics concludes that eating lots of   foods during high school years may significantly reduce a womanÃ¢ÂÂs risk of developing breast cancer. The findings are based on a   study of 44, 000 women who were surveyed about their eating habits in high school. The women also completed detailed questionnaires about their dietary habits every four years. The researchers found that women who consumed high levels of fiber (28 grams per day, on average) had a 24 percent lower risk of developing breast cancer before menopause, compared with women who ate low levels of fiber (14 grams per day, on average). For the women on the   diet, the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer was also cut by 16 percent. Of course, the idea that   diets can help keep us healthy is not new. ItÃ¢ÂÂs   that fiber can prevent constipation and keep the bowel moving by making stools bulkier and absorbing water. Prior studies have shown dietary fiber can protect against colorectal cancer and may lower the risks of diabetes and heart disease. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs also a growing body of evidence linking fiber to weight management. This new study provides some evidence of yet another potential benefit. Ã¢ÂÂThis is a really important study . .. [suggesting] that the more fiber you eat during your high school years, the lower your risk is in developing breast cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ says Kimberly Blackwell, a breast cancer specialist at the Duke Cancer Center. In a commentary accompanying the study in Pediatrics, Blackwell writes, Ã¢ÂÂThere is longstanding evidence that dietary fibers may reduce circulating estrogen levels.Ã¢ÂÂ And this may help explain the reduced risk of breast cancer. The authors point to other possible explanations, too. For instance,   diets may reduce the risk of breast cancer by improving insulin sensitivity, since fiber can slow down the absorption of sugars and help keep blood sugar levels more stable. Maryam Farvid, a fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health who is lead author of the study, says the influence of fiber on cancer risk may be  . Adolescence is Ã¢ÂÂa period when breast cancer risk factors appear to be particularly important,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. One limitation of this new study is that it relies on data from women who had to recall what they ate during high school. They were in their 30s and 40 when asked, so there could be Ã¢ÂÂrecall biasÃ¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ the womenÃ¢ÂÂs memories may be foggy. Ã¢ÂÂThe recollection of dietary habits more than a decade earlier must be questioned,Ã¢ÂÂ writes Blackwell. On the other hand, she says, Ã¢ÂÂpeopleÃ¢ÂÂs dietary habits donÃ¢ÂÂt really change a lot. . .. In general, what you eat as a teenager is really formative as to what you eat later in life.Ã¢ÂÂ So, how might the message of this new study linking   diets to a lower risk of breast cancer be communicated to teenagers? This is a question Kristi King, a dietitian at Texas ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital, has thought about a lot. She says it can be hard to get the attention of teenagers about healthy eating. Ã¢ÂÂUnfortunately for teenagers, theyÃ¢ÂÂre [into] instant gratification,Ã¢ÂÂ and theyÃ¢ÂÂre not necessarily focused on how their actions today will influence their future health, she says. But, she says, explaining that dietary choices may influence their risk of breast cancer may grab their attention. Ã¢ÂÂMost teenage girls do know someone that has been affected by breast cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ says King. Ã¢ÂÂSo I feel like that touches a nerve with them.Ã¢ÂÂ Given the known benefits of   diets and the growing evidence that fiber may play a role in preventing disease, the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs Dietary Guidelines for Americans also say most people need to consume more. Women are advised to consume 25 grams a day. Men are advised to consume 38 grams a day. So, how best to reach these targets? Ã¢ÂÂAdd fiber at each meal,Ã¢ÂÂ says King, in the form of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts or seeds. Pears are a great bet with 7 grams of fiber apiece.

2226,"At 46 years old, Oliver BoglerÃ¢ÂÂs reaction to a suspicious lump in his chest might seem typical for a man. He ignored it for three to four months, maybe longer. Ã¢ÂÂI couldnÃ¢ÂÂt really imagine I would have this disease,Ã¢ÂÂ Bogler says. But when he finally Ã¢ÂÂgrew upÃ¢ÂÂ and went to the doctor, he was pretty quickly diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. Now whatÃ¢ÂÂs interesting here is that Bogler is a cancer biologist who regularly works with cancer cells, as senior vice president of academic affairs at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Even so, he figured the lump was a benign swelling of breast tissue. He had good reason to think so. Breast cancer is rare among men. Only 1 percent of all breast cancer cases are in men. Still, that means about 2, 600 men receive a diagnosis of breast cancer every year. But men typically donÃ¢ÂÂt think they are at risk, says Dr. Sharon Giordano, an oncologist who also works at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. Ã¢ÂÂMen donÃ¢ÂÂt think of themselves as having breasts,Ã¢ÂÂ Giordano says. Ã¢ÂÂThey donÃ¢ÂÂt realize that all men have some residual breast tissue.Ã¢ÂÂ So itÃ¢ÂÂs not unusual to see male patients like Bogler who come to her with more advanced breast cancer than the typical female patient. This could be one reason why men have a lower life expectancy after a breast cancer diagnosis. According to a study published in 2012, in the Annals of Surgical Oncology, men with early breast cancer had a 74 percent survival rate five years after their diagnosis compared to women, whose survival rate was 83 percent. And men not only can get breast cancer, they can also inherit the BRCA1 and 2 genetic mutations that place them at greater risk. Like women, they can pass that mutation on to their children, who have a 50 percent chance of inheriting a parentÃ¢ÂÂs mutation. Once men are diagnosed, their treatment is pretty much the same as it is for women  Ã¢ÂÂ   typically surgery to remove the cancer followed by chemotherapy, radiation and hormone suppressing medication like tamoxifen. That was the case for Bogler, but with one big difference  Ã¢ÂÂ   he had a mastectomy. Most women choose lumpectomies followed by radiation. This is often not an option for men, Giordano says, because their tumors are most commonly right behind the nipple, where thereÃ¢ÂÂs not a lot of breast tissue to remove. Unlike women, most men donÃ¢ÂÂt have reconstructive surgery. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs probably because they donÃ¢ÂÂt even know itÃ¢ÂÂs an option, says Giordano. A lot of male patients would probably be interested in having nipple reconstructive surgery, Giordano says, Ã¢ÂÂSo when they are out swimming, or playing basketball and have their shirt off, the surgical changes arenÃ¢ÂÂt quite so obvious.Ã¢ÂÂ And because breast cancer is so much more common among women, men with the disease can experience something of a Ã¢ÂÂgender misfit.Ã¢ÂÂ Bogler wrote about his experience in a personal blog he called Entering a World of Pink. Breast cancer clinics are often decorated in lots of pink, and support systems are designed with women in mind. Giordano recalls one male patient who, after a biopsy, was given a pink floral ice pack that came with instructions to Ã¢ÂÂplace it inside your bra.Ã¢ÂÂ When Edward Smith was diagnosed about four years ago, he went online to look for information and emotional support. The first couple of chat rooms he joined were not helpful, he says, when the participants found out he was a man. Ã¢ÂÂThey werenÃ¢ÂÂt outright nasty or anything, but you could just feel that they were pulling back in terms of the conversation that was going on at the time,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Eventually Smith found a site that was welcoming  Ã¢ÂÂ   Living Beyond Breast Cancer. The women in this group were helpful, compassionate and willing to talk, Smith says. This was important because he was feeling a bit uncomfortable at work. Colleagues were just Ã¢ÂÂstupefied,Ã¢ÂÂ he says, Ã¢ÂÂbecause most people have never encountered a male who had breast cancer.Ã¢ÂÂ The website recently published a guide for men, which Smith found particularly helpful. The medical information isnÃ¢ÂÂt so different from women, says Jean Sachs, executive director of Living Beyond Breast Cancer, but the experience is very different. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs hard to get men to talk about it,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. The guide provides a list of men, including Smith, who are willing to talk to other men about their experience. ItÃ¢ÂÂs also important, Sachs says, for men who test positive for the BRACA genetic mutations to understand that they can pass those mutations on to their children, which may encourage newly diagnosed patients to get tested. The lack of awareness, even among doctors, oncologist Giordano says, means less money for needed research to figure out how breast cancer in men differs from women especially when it comes to life saving treatment. Treatments for men are based on evidence from research trials with women. GiordanoÃ¢ÂÂs now heading up research to better understand the biology of the disease in men and to try to figure out the most effective hormone therapy for men with breast cancer.",cancer,"When Men Get Breast Cancer, They Enter A World Of Pink",2226.0,2226.0,226.0,
2227,"U. S. health regulators acknowledged they miscalculated the amount of formaldehyde emitted from some of Lumber LiquidatorsÃ¢ÂÂ laminated floor products. Shares of the company fell sharply Monday on the news. The Centers for Disease Control And Prevention says the risk of cancer is three times higher than it previously estimated, and it strongly urged Lumber Liquidators customers to take steps to reduce exposure to the substance. The company no longer sells the   laminate products. The agency said its Ã¢ÂÂindoor air model used an incorrect value for ceiling height. As a result, the health risks were calculated using airborne concentration estimates about 3 times lower than they should have been.Ã¢ÂÂ The higher levels Ã¢ÂÂcould cause increased frequency of asthma symptoms and other respiratory issues for people with asthma and COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].Ã¢ÂÂ Last March, a report on 60 Minutes said laminate floor products made in one of the retailerÃ¢ÂÂs Chinese factories had unsafe levels of formaldehyde, a known carcinogen. At the time, the company disputed the allegations, saying they were driven by   who stood to benefit when the stock price fell. On Feb. 10, the CDC issued a report estimating that the risk of cancer presented by the products was two to nine cases per 100, 000 people. The agency subsequently learned that the risk was six to 30 cases. The error occurred because the CDC neglected to convert feet to meters in some calculations in the first reports, according to 60 Minutes. The CDC said the acknowledgement of the error had not changed its fundamental recommendations to customers dealing with the contaminated products: Ã¢ÂÂOur recommendations will likely remain the same  Ã¢ÂÂ   we strongly stress taking steps to reduce exposures, which should alleviate respiratory and eye, nose and throat irritation. These steps should also reduce the cancer risk.Ã¢ÂÂ The company said it supports the recommendations and is Ã¢ÂÂencouragedÃ¢ÂÂ that the agency is reviewing its calculations, according to Bloomberg News: Ã¢ÂÂThe company also repeated that it has strengthened its   procedures, suspended sales of Chinese laminate and offered free air tests to customers. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂWe remain committed to operating with integrity and delivering quality flooring to our customers,Ã¢ÂÂ the Toano, Va.  company said in an   statement.Ã¢ÂÂ Last year, the company pleaded guilty to charges of making false declarations on import documents about the source of some of its flooring, and it agreed to a   settlement with the Justice Department.

2228,"Ã¢ÂÂSome things are hard and some things are right. And some things are both,Ã¢ÂÂ Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a Wednesday night interview on ABC NewsÃ¢ÂÂ World News Tonight with David Muir. Ã¢ÂÂThis is one of those things,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, doubling down on the companyÃ¢ÂÂs refusal to create a way for the FBI to access data on the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters. Last week, a federal judge ordered Apple to help the FBI crack into the iPhone of Syed Rizwan Farook who, along with wife Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people and wounded 22 others in December. As the   reported, shortly after government officials obtained the iPhone Farook used, a San Bernardino County employee working with federal authorities reset the password for its iCloud account  Ã¢ÂÂ   meaning the phone could no longer perform an automatic wireless backup that could have enabled Apple to recover information. In the interview, Cook called this a crucial mistake, saying there is now only one way to get information from the phone. Ã¢ÂÂThe only way to get information  Ã¢ÂÂ   at least currently, the only way we know  Ã¢ÂÂ   would be to write a piece of software that we view as sort of the equivalent of cancer. We think itÃ¢ÂÂs bad news to write. We would never write it. We have never written it  Ã¢ÂÂ   and that is what is at stake here,Ã¢ÂÂ Cook said. Ã¢ÂÂWe believe that is a very dangerous operating system.Ã¢ÂÂ The government has said that the software key would be limited in scope, but Cook rejected that characterization. Ã¢ÂÂThis case is not about one phone. This case is about the future,Ã¢ÂÂ Cook said. Ã¢ÂÂIf we knew a way to get the information on the phone  Ã¢ÂÂ   that we havenÃ¢ÂÂt already given  Ã¢ÂÂ   if we knew a way to do this, that would not expose hundreds of millions of other people to issues, we would obviously do it. . .. Our job is to protect our customers.Ã¢ÂÂ Following the federal magistrateÃ¢ÂÂs ruling, Cook posted a statement on AppleÃ¢ÂÂs website which argued the government was effectively ordering Apple to put its customers at risk by compromising their privacy. Ã¢ÂÂWe can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack,Ã¢ÂÂ Cook wrote. But thatÃ¢ÂÂs not exactly true, NPR tech reporter Aarti Shahani says. As Shahani reports on Morning Edition, in the 1990s federal regulators blocked Microsoft from selling software with advanced encryption abroad because it could have a military application. Shahani says Microsoft altered its software to satisfy regulatorsÃ¢ÂÂ concerns. Ã¢ÂÂMicrosoft had to basically weaken its product so they could enter foreign markets,Ã¢ÂÂ Shahani says. Ã¢ÂÂThat definitely impacted privacy, exposed customers to greater risk.Ã¢ÂÂ On Sunday, FBI Director James Comey made his case in a blog post on the Lawfare website, writing: Ã¢ÂÂWe donÃ¢ÂÂt want to break anyoneÃ¢ÂÂs encryption or set a master key loose on the land. . .. Maybe the phone holds the clue to finding more terrorists. Maybe it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt. But we canÃ¢ÂÂt look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we donÃ¢ÂÂt follow this lead.Ã¢ÂÂ But Cook contends that creating a way around the encryption would put hundreds of million of people at risk and Ã¢ÂÂtrample on civil liberties.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂOur smartphones are loaded with our intimate conversations, our financial data, our health records. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre also loaded with the location of our kids in many cases. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not just about privacy, itÃ¢ÂÂs also about public safety,Ã¢ÂÂ Cook said. Ã¢ÂÂNo one would want a master key built that would turn hundreds of millions of locks . .. that key could be stolen.Ã¢ÂÂ Cook also said that he would be speaking with President Obama about the issue, but said he would be willing to fight the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs order all the way to the Supreme Court.",cancer,Apple CEO Tim Cook: Backdoor To iPhones Would Be Software Equivalent Of Cancer,2228.0,2228.0,228.0,
2229,"Cancer dogma holds that most malignancies are caused by DNA mutations inside the nuclei of cells, mutations that ultimately lead to runaway cellular proliferation. Given the countless genetic blips that have been associated with various cancers, the illness has actually come to be seen as a complex of diseases for which personalized treatments might offer the best chances of success. But prevailing oncology orthodoxy has its detractors, and some cancer biologists feel that while mutations are nearly ubiquitous in cancer, they may not always be the driving force for disease. Cancer, they suggest, might actually be as much a disorder of altered energy production as it is genetic damage. This idea traces back to the work of German physician Otto Warburg who, in the 1920s, reported that rather than generating energy using the   process of respiration as healthy cells do, cancer cells prefer the anaerobic, or   process of fermentation. Not all products of fermentation are as welcome as beer, wine and cheese. Boston College biology professor Dr. Thomas Seyfried is a leading proponent of the metabolic theory of cancer. He proselytizes WarburgÃ¢ÂÂs findings and in 2012 published an academic book called Cancer as a Metabolic Disease that lays out the evidence behind his beliefs (Currently the bookÃ¢ÂÂs Facebook page has over 6, 000 followers and a lively exchange of   tips). Seyfried argues that decades of research, including his own, support the idea that aberrant metabolism can somehow induce malignancy. Further, he believes that research supports at the idea that limiting the fuels available for fermentation  Ã¢ÂÂ   that is, the sugar glucose and the amino acid glutamine  Ã¢ÂÂ   is an overlooked approach to aid treatment. He specifically implicates mitochondria, our   organelles, in spurring on malignancy. This belief is in part based on work from the Ã¢ÂÂ70s and Ã¢ÂÂ80s showing that if the cytoplasm (the buoyant cellular goo that contains the mitochondria) is transferred from a normal cells to a tumorigenic cell (one with the potential to develop into a cancer) the tendency toward cancer is suppressed. Conversely, animal research has shown that transferring the nucleus of a malignant cell into the cytoplasm of a normal cell inhibits the tumor potential of that initially malignant cell, implying, according to Seyfried, that whatever is causing the cancer lies in the cytoplasm, not the nucleus. More recent research shows that the introduction of mutations in mitochondrial DNA (former   organisms that our cells eventually engulfed, mitochondria have their own genetic material) reduces the tumor protection purportedly provided by normal mitochondria. Ã¢ÂÂIf you look at the data, you could say that there is clear evidence that cancer is a genetic disease since we can inherit mutations associated with increased cancer risk,Ã¢ÂÂ says Seyfried, Ã¢ÂÂbut many of these mutations disturb cellular respiration. And many   causes of cancer like radiation impair mitochondrial function.Ã¢ÂÂ SeyfriedÃ¢ÂÂs colleague Dominic DÃ¢ÂÂAgostino, a biology professor at the University of South Florida, also subscribes to the idea that the primary driver of cancer is mitochondrial dysfunction, which can be induced by any number of carcinogens  Ã¢ÂÂ   genetic predilections, radiation, chemical exposures and diet among them. Not only do many mutations and pathways associated with cancer impair mitochondrial function and cell metabolism, he says, but injured mitochondria also produce volatile compounds called Ã¢ÂÂreactive oxygen speciesÃ¢ÂÂ that can damage DNA. Ã¢ÂÂThis can explain why most cancers have mutations,Ã¢ÂÂ he speculates, Ã¢ÂÂin many cases theyÃ¢ÂÂre secondary to mitochondrial damage.Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. E. Aubrey Thompson, a cancer biologist at the Mayo Clinic who in his own words is Ã¢ÂÂstrongly on the mutation side,Ã¢ÂÂ acknowledges that cancer cells   their metabolic activities and that interfering with cancer metabolism is a potentially fruitful area of research. Ã¢ÂÂThere are hundreds of labs already working on this right now,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Yet, he adds genially, Ã¢ÂÂthere is no evidence of malignancy developing in the absence of mutations. Anyone who thinks otherwise is obligated to design an experiment to disprove this concept . .. thatÃ¢ÂÂs how science works.Ã¢ÂÂ It turns out there is some evidence that this might happen, but itÃ¢ÂÂs limited. Seyfried pointed me to a 2015 paper by Dr. Stuart Baker of the National Cancer Institute that reviews four recent studies reporting numerous tumors in which zero mutations were found. Seyfried acknowledges that mutations might have been found with more thorough screening and better DNA sequencing technology. Memorial   Cancer Center President and CEO Dr. Craig Thompson (not to be confused with MayoÃ¢ÂÂs Thompson) hedges on the metabolic theory of cancer. Ã¢ÂÂWhile the arguments raised [by Seyfried and others] have been considered by the growing field of cancer metabolism, most investigators have moved on to consider other explanations for the observations,Ã¢ÂÂ he said in an interview. Still, he has recently written in support of some aspects of the theory with therapeutic implications. In a way, the various competing cancer theories arenÃ¢ÂÂt completely at odds. Ã¢ÂÂDespite all the talk of controversy in the field, the concepts that [Seyfried] and his colleagues are advancing are not really that novel,Ã¢ÂÂ says MayoÃ¢ÂÂs Thompson  Ã¢ÂÂI think everybody who works in cancer biology today appreciates the fact that there are many different processes involved in a conversion of a normal cell to a tumor cell.Ã¢ÂÂ He believes a coalescence of pernicious influences is required for a cancer to develop. Ã¢ÂÂOne of these processes is probably altered metabolic activity,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Ã¢ÂÂBut cancers also must acquire mutations, change the way they interact with neighboring cells and learn to evade the immune system. Every single one of these processes is probably essential to cancer development.Ã¢ÂÂ Matthew Vander Heiden, a biologist at MIT and oncologist at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, also says many factors are necessary to induce cancer, including what could be considered the other major theory on the origin of malignancies, that they result from the impairment of signaling pathways that control cell division. Ã¢ÂÂMy guess is itÃ¢ÂÂs probably metabolic, and itÃ¢ÂÂs probably genetic and itÃ¢ÂÂs probably cell signaling. IÃ¢ÂÂm not sure you can separate these out since they all appear to be so interrelated,Ã¢ÂÂ he explains. Regardless of the initial cancer trigger, the ultimate end of the biomedical bickering is to help patients. And as Vander Heiden points out, not only are researchers and pharmaceutical companies already developing drugs that target metabolic pathways, such drugs have been around for some time. Ã¢ÂÂI think targeting metabolic pathways in cancer is a great idea. We already have five or six mainstay chemotherapies that yes, attack cell division machinery, but also target metabolism Ã¢ÂÂ explains Vander Heiden, Ã¢ÂÂTheyÃ¢ÂÂre just not billed that way. Ã¢ÂÂSeyfried is skeptical that medicines alone will cure cancer. Instead he and many of his colleagues  Ã¢ÂÂ   including Dr. Eugene Fine from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and University of Pittsburgh neurosurgeon Dr. Joseph Maroon  Ã¢ÂÂ   are focusing on the potential of dietary approaches to contain the disease. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs particular interest in the ketogenic diet, similar to the   Atkins diet that is low in sugar and high in fat. ItÃ¢ÂÂs intended to starve cancer cells of the glucose they use for fermentation. Ã¢ÂÂThe drugs we have now are so toxic and thereÃ¢ÂÂs no reason people should have to be poisoned to be healthy. There are a number of studies, including those weÃ¢ÂÂve published, showing a direct relationship between the ketogenic diet and slowed tumor growth,Ã¢ÂÂ says Seyfried, also citing the work of Dr. Valter Longo, of the University of Southern CaliforniaÃ¢ÂÂs Davis School of Gerontology. That work shows that   diets are linked with slowed tumor growth and improved response to chemotherapy. Ã¢ÂÂWhy spend all this money going after all these different pathways involved in cancer when you can simply go after the key fuels?Ã¢ÂÂ Seyfried asks. The idea of fighting cancer by changing what patients eat has obvious appeal, but it also raises worries. Ã¢ÂÂI get a little scared when people start talking about diet for cancer since you can quickly get into pseudoscience here,Ã¢ÂÂ MayoÃ¢ÂÂs Thompson counters. He points out that data supporting the ketogenic diet in cancer are limited  Ã¢ÂÂ   and further that rigorous dietary studies are incredibly hard to pull off. Ã¢ÂÂThe drug companies arenÃ¢ÂÂt going to fund these types of trials,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Ã¢ÂÂThey canÃ¢ÂÂt make money marketing a diet.Ã¢ÂÂ Vander Heiden is also wary of many dietary claims, in part because of biased expectations. Ã¢ÂÂIt seems that people have often decided what diet they think is best before they do a study,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂs a difference between setting out to prove something is a good therapy and asking what therapy is best.Ã¢ÂÂ His own work has shown that certain dietary interventions can be more effective than drugs at treating cancer in mice, but he says panacean claims about the ketogenic diet specifically are a bit premature. Ã¢ÂÂI think itÃ¢ÂÂs a really interesting hypothesis that should continue to be tested, but to claim that cancer is all metabolic or all genetic is probably incorrect,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Ã¢ÂÂUsually in science when you have something as complex as cancer, ascribing it to one particular cause is often going too far.Ã¢ÂÂ Even Seyfried acknowledges, despite his zeal for treating cancer by tinkering with calories, that in all likelihood diet and   cancer treatments will serve as adjuncts to existing therapies. But what would be wrong with that? Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre slowing the tumor down and making it extremely vulnerable to lower,   doses of available drugs,Ã¢ÂÂ he says, Ã¢ÂÂWhen people are locked into an ideology created by a dogma they tend not to focus on rational alternatives.Ã¢ÂÂ Bret Stetka is a writer based in New York and an editorial director at Medscape.

2230,"Spending on prescription drugs in the U. S. rose 5. 2 percent in 2015, driven mostly by increased costs of expensive specialty medications to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, according to data from the largest manager of employersÃ¢ÂÂ drug benefits. Spending on specialty medications rose 18 percent, while spending on standard prescription drugs rose less than one percent, according to a new report by Express Scripts. The report is based on the prescription drug spending for the companyÃ¢ÂÂs 80 million covered patients. The measure  Ã¢ÂÂ   called Ã¢ÂÂdrug trendÃ¢ÂÂ in pharmaceutical industry parlance  Ã¢ÂÂ   includes increases in the use of medications and price hikes. Still, in the health care industry, an increase thatÃ¢ÂÂs more than quadruple the rate of inflation  Ã¢ÂÂ   0. 7 percent in 2015  Ã¢ÂÂ   still counts as a bit of good news. Why? In 2014, drug spending increased more than 14 percent. Ã¢ÂÂIn a year when all the headlines were about the escalating price of drugs, overall costs rose only 5. 2 percent,Ã¢ÂÂ says Glen Stettin, Express ScriptsÃ¢ÂÂ chief innovation officer. The overall boost in drug spending was moderated by patients switching to generic drugs from brand names, whose prices rose 16. 2 percent. Stettin attributed that shift to pharmacy benefit managers and insurers exerting more control over the drugs their customers can get. Express Scripts and other companies have been more willing to refuse coverage of expensive medications than in the past. The company pointed to its initial refusal to pay for Gilead SciencesÃ¢ÂÂ hepatitis C drugs, which were listed at more than $90, 000 for a course of treatment. Instead, Express Scripts opted to cover an alternative treatment, Viekira Pak made by AbbVie, for which it negotiated a 50 percent discount. Express Scripts has said it saved as much as $1 billion with the deal. Brand name drug prices are more than 2   times as high as they were in 2008, while generic prices have declined by about  . For traditional pills, Ã¢ÂÂtotal costs are flat as result of generic and effective price negotiation by payors,Ã¢ÂÂ says Ronny Gal, a pharmaceutial industry analyst at the investment firm Alliance Bernstein. Ã¢ÂÂFor specialty drugs, there are more drug introductions, at very high price per patient per year, and we still donÃ¢ÂÂt have effective alternatives on the market.Ã¢ÂÂ The report says the surge in spending on specialty drugs was caused in part by the 29 new medications that were approved by the Food and Drug Administration last year, including 19 cancer drugs that are being used on a large number of patients. The prices of older cancer drugs also rose, including for example, the price of Gleevec, which is used to treat adults with leukemia. It went up 19. 3 percent last year, the report says. But drugs for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and other inflammatory illnesses sucked up the largest share of cash. Express Scripts says treatments for such conditions cost every person with insurance about $89 last year. Insurers use a measure known as Ã¢ÂÂper member per yearÃ¢ÂÂ to show how spending is spread across population of insured people. Diabetes treatments dominated the spending on nonspecialty medications, the report shows, with spending rising 14 percent last year. Three of the top five traditional prescription drugs were diabetes medications  Ã¢ÂÂ   Lantus and Humalog, which are both forms of insulin, and Januvia, a pill that helps control blood sugar. People who bought insurance through the exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act spent an average of $777 on medications last year, about 15 percent higher than the year before. The big increase Ã¢ÂÂmay be due to patients in this population filling a previously unmet need,Ã¢ÂÂ according to the report. Since the exchanges have only been in place for two full years, Stettin says this is the first time there was good information available about people covered by those policies. The spending increase Ã¢ÂÂis consistent with the belief that people in the exchange plans, people with chronic conditions, are getting medications for the first time,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. The Express Scripts report takes into account the effect of rebates that the company negotiates with drugmakers without disclosing the details of the arrangements. Rebates are considered trade secrets. Bruce Stuart, executive director of the Peter Lamy Center for Drug Therapy and Aging at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, says the data are different from what he would have expected based on trends in retail prices. Ã¢ÂÂI have no reason to doubt their numbers,Ã¢ÂÂ he tells Shots. Ã¢ÂÂIf they say that they are getting better deals, thereÃ¢ÂÂs no way to validate that.

2231,"Ã¢ÂÂ[T]here was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well.Ã¢ÂÂ That fairly familiar line, a mere fleeting perception from The Great Gatsby, is the bedrock wisdom of Charles BockÃ¢ÂÂs beautiful and harrowing new novel, Alice  Oliver. Alice is a new mother in her 20s who, one day, out of the blue, coughs up bloody phlegm, collapses and is diagnosed with leukemia. Oliver is her husband. HeÃ¢ÂÂs a trouper who hangs onto his job and tends their baby daughter, shaves his head in solidarity when Alice goes through chemo, and braves the hellish maze of health insurance to try to secure the care she needs for survival. But, no matter how loving and connected the two of them are, once cancer enters their lives, Alice is the sick one and Oliver isnÃ¢ÂÂt. Bock could have chosen to write this story as an autobiography. As he tells readers in the Ã¢ÂÂAcknowledgmentsÃ¢ÂÂ here, Alice  Oliver is based on a   nightmare that began in 2009, when his wife  Ã¢ÂÂ   then a young mother  Ã¢ÂÂ   was diagnosed with leukemia she died 2   years later. The novelÃ¢ÂÂs source, no doubt, imbues it with authority, but its literary power derives from BockÃ¢ÂÂs elastic language, stretching from his detailed inventories of extreme medical procedures to the lyric melancholy of his descriptions of mood and place. The novel opens in 1993. Alice, a fashion designer, and Oliver, a software startup entrepreneur, have moved, at his insistence, to an industrial space in the   ungentrified Meatpacking District in New York. WeÃ¢ÂÂre told that the neighborhoodÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂevery daylight hour was dominated by dock thugs and frozen slabs after dark, rotted zombie addicts held court with   sex club slaves and transvestite streetwalkers . ..Ã¢ÂÂ Oliver, though, is handy with screwdrivers and power sanders, and he transforms the desolate living space into a soaring ultramodern loft. But hereÃ¢ÂÂs the kicker. After Alice is diagnosed, and Ã¢ÂÂwhen she was at her worst,Ã¢ÂÂ weÃ¢ÂÂre privy to this confession: [W]hen she needed to blame Oliver for something, for anything, she returned to the promise she couldnÃ¢ÂÂt forget, high on his list of guarantees: theyÃ¢ÂÂd be insulated the smells from the warehouses, frozen beef and lingering death, wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt reach them. But they did. BockÃ¢ÂÂs elegance as a writer belies his resolute focus on the elemental meatiness of the human body  Ã¢ÂÂ   its many vulnerabilities and humiliations. The novel follows Alice through her course of treatment for leukemia those readers fortunate enough to be unfamiliar with medical terms like Ã¢ÂÂinduction,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂconsolidationÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂtransplantÃ¢ÂÂ are thrust into their baroque and brutal realities as Alice sheds hair and skin and even the energy to hold a thought. And always, on the other side of the Ã¢ÂÂsick and wellÃ¢ÂÂ dividing line, stands Oliver, guilty and oftentimes, just itching to escape hospital world. Early on in their ordeal, weÃ¢ÂÂre told that when relief arrives in the form of AliceÃ¢ÂÂs mother: [T]he clock started eating into [OliverÃ¢ÂÂs] holy and awaited break time. [HeÃ¢ÂÂd] hightail it [out] . .. grabbing a chicken sandwich from a sports bar [or] . .. some sad Chinese lunch from a buffet table of greased food rotting beneath heat lamps. . .. Overprocessed,    garbage: his official coping mechanism. He made sure to binge away from the hospital. . .. He wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt let her see anything that might cause her faith in him to waver. But as the months of torment drag on on, OliverÃ¢ÂÂs binges grow more varied and reckless. Bock is unflinching here in his depiction of failures of the body and the spirit. Alice  Oliver is both haunting and raw  Ã¢ÂÂ   a rare novel about cancer that, in this case, doesnÃ¢ÂÂt try to find meaning in serious illness, but rather gives its random malevolence its full due.",cancer,"This Novel DoesnÃ¢ÂÂt Find Meaning In Cancer, It Gives Its Malevolence Full Due",2231.0,2231.0,231.0,

In his off hours, heÃ¢ÂÂd been active for years in local theater as an actor, writer and director. Now, he was having trouble navigating his way through a sentence. Ã¢ÂÂTechnically, all tumors are operable,Ã¢ÂÂ Friesema explains. Ã¢ÂÂThe question that comes into play is, what are you willing to sacrifice in order to get it out? The position and location of his tumor is such that you would have to completely destroy a lot of healthy brain tissue in order to remove it. You would be creating a situation of paralysis, major cognitive dysfunction, irreversible brain damage  Ã¢ÂÂ   and, ultimately, for possibly very little reward. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no way of skirting it: I was looking at his death.Ã¢ÂÂ Around Thanksgiving last year, Julian was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer at the age of 57. They decided not to try to stretch his last months with chemo and radiation therapy. Julian has less time than he might have, but he can eat what he wants, sleep with their dogs, and squeeze the last juice out of the days that remain with his wife. SheÃ¢ÂÂs taking time off from work, thanks to a compassionate boss. In the 20 or more hours a day that Julian now sleeps, Friesema takes care of everything else  Ã¢ÂÂ   the meals, the housekeeping, the medicine, insurance and the emotional management. Of course, friends and family are helping. Larry Mantle, JulianÃ¢ÂÂs dearest pal, comes over for company and a wee dram of whiskey. Friends have delivered dozens of lasagnas to the doorstep and whipped out their credit cards to cover what insurance doesnÃ¢ÂÂt. But at the end of the day, Friesema is alone. And every morning, thereÃ¢ÂÂs a little bit less of Julian. Reaching Out Online, It was a few months into his diagnosis when we noticed Felicia FriesemaÃ¢ÂÂs journal on Caring Bridge, a website designed to help families and friends of someone who is ill give updates and get them, and offer and receive encouragement. We recognized a kindred spirit in Friesema  Ã¢ÂÂ   someone else in the special club of those who have lost or who are losing a close loved one. We had to fly down to Los Angeles and meet this woman who wrote so deeply and thoughtfully, and with such compassion, about a journey no one chooses. Ã¢ÂÂI know that this is treacherous ground we walk on and that time is of the essence. We wake up to the juxtaposition of joy in another day together and terror at what may come. Ã¢ÂÂThere is no detailed prognosis yet. But we do know that there is no outcome we like. And I have never been so scared. But I have also never been so completely full of love for him.Ã¢ÂÂ That was Dec. 2, 2015. At that point, Steve Julian could still help his wife craft a communique to friends: Ã¢ÂÂI miss being at work and in the studio. I miss being with all the people I love at KPCC. IÃ¢ÂÂm still good at traffic. We chose UCLA for the surgery and treatment, and navigating to the westside can be tricky. The tumor can take away what I had for dinner, but not my memory of the traffic jams IÃ¢ÂÂve sat in. Ã¢ÂÂI am sad. I feel the unfairness of all of this. But I also feel the love for my wife, which grows every day as she balances the technical work of our affairs with the emotional work of our daily life. Like making sure I eat three solid meals. And I mean really solid. Four, sometimes. She tells me IÃ¢ÂÂm loved about a hundred times a day  Ã¢ÂÂ   I remember a few of them. Larry [Mantle, host of Air Talk] my brother in all but blood, is a rock for both of us and has been by our side from diagnosis until now.Ã¢ÂÂ Many people facing down the gun barrel of something this awful retreat into family. But Friesema reached out from the beginning to friends online. Ã¢ÂÂWe kind of had to,Ã¢ÂÂ she explains. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂve kind of got a unique and peculiar situation. I mean, JulianÃ¢ÂÂs a very popular radio host in a very large market. HeÃ¢ÂÂs also incredibly involved in the theater community here. He also used to be a cop. So, you have these seemingly disparate communities that heÃ¢ÂÂs connected to. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs thousands of people  Ã¢ÂÂ   his most intimate friends all the way down to the casual listener.Ã¢ÂÂ From the peace and quiet of their home on the hill, when Julian is sleeping, Friesema can write about all the medical details that would exhaust her if she had to repeat them to people in one individual conversation after another. Friesema also uses the blog to process whatÃ¢ÂÂs happening in her world, Ã¢ÂÂto take this jumbled   of   notes and ideas and thoughts and put them together into something that is like, Ã¢ÂÂOh! OK.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂUsually, I donÃ¢ÂÂt know when IÃ¢ÂÂm going to conclude until I start writing,Ã¢ÂÂ she says, Ã¢ÂÂand by the end of it, IÃ¢ÂÂm like, Ã¢ÂÂOh, thatÃ¢ÂÂs my Ã¢ÂÂahaÃ¢ÂÂ moment. OK. All right.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ On Facebook, for a smaller, closer audience, Friesema shares   missives from her daily journey  Ã¢ÂÂ   proof the bees in the backyard are making Ã¢ÂÂSo. Much. Honey.Ã¢ÂÂ Or her desperate wish that MRI machines played Brian Eno instead of frightening clicks and buzzes. Her rage against the insurance company, or her pride in yet another crazy, beautiful meal made for Julian. And then there are the jokes. If anything, staring down death has heightened the coupleÃ¢ÂÂs sense of humor. Ã¢ÂÂFun with brain cancer: Ã¢ÂÂSteve: Jen! Me: Yeah, babe (knowing full well he was calling for me). Steve: Oh, IÃ¢ÂÂm sorry. I just called you Jen. Me: Yeah, I know, babe. ItÃ¢ÂÂs OK. WhatÃ¢ÂÂs up? Steve: (tells me some stuff he needs). Me: No problem. By the way (smiling) IÃ¢ÂÂd like to know who the hell Jen is. Steve: (chuckles) So would I!Ã¢ÂÂ The love has come pouring in from all corners. By Jan. 4, Friesema reported that more than 100 people had made deliveries, run errands or completed tasks around the house. JulianÃ¢ÂÂs had a sandwich named after him at Wax Paper, a local sandwich shop with a thing for public radio. Friends have blogged about Julian. Local Morning Edition hosts across the country recorded their well wishes on YouTube. People Ã¢ÂÂare grateful for being included,Ã¢ÂÂ Friesema says, Ã¢ÂÂor grateful just to know that SteveÃ¢ÂÂs OK for now. Or theyÃ¢ÂÂre grateful for an opportunity to help. IÃ¢ÂÂd been crying so hard just a few days ago. I just couldnÃ¢ÂÂt stop. I was so sad and so dejected. And, at the end of the day, my status update on Facebook was, Ã¢ÂÂThere just arenÃ¢ÂÂt enough tissues in the box.Ã¢ÂÂ So, the next day, what arrives on my doorstep but a case of Kleenex. And the message was, Ã¢ÂÂWe know that this isnÃ¢ÂÂt enough, but hopefully it helps.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂOne of the things weÃ¢ÂÂve been focusing on,Ã¢ÂÂ Friesema says, Ã¢ÂÂis making sure that every day is about some kind of pleasure  Ã¢ÂÂ   some kind of happy moment, some laugh, something in there that actually makes the day not a routine of caregiving.Ã¢ÂÂ Friesema sighs. Ã¢ÂÂYou know, something that reminds us that there are all these wonderful pieces to life and that living doesnÃ¢ÂÂt stop with a cancer diagnosis.Ã¢ÂÂ What remains online from this journey is a whole lot more than the testament to the love that people have for Steve Julian and Felicia Friesema. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a social network  Ã¢ÂÂ   in the best sense  Ã¢ÂÂ   that will be there for Friesema, waiting to engage and respond anytime she wants.

2233,"WeÃ¢ÂÂve made great progress treating people who are infected with HIV, but if they get cancer theyÃ¢ÂÂre less likely to get the care they need, a recent study found. Researchers examined treatment for a variety of cancers, including upper gastrointestinal tract, colorectal, prostate, lung, head and neck, cervix, breast, anal and two blood cancers. With the exception of anal cancer, treatment rates differed significantly between   people and those who werenÃ¢ÂÂt infected, according to the study published online Tuesday by the journal Cancer. For example, a third of patients with HIV and lung cancer failed to receive any treatment for the cancer, compared with 14 percent of those who were  . Similarly, 44 percent of people who were   didnÃ¢ÂÂt receive treatment for upper GI cancer versus 18 percent of those who werenÃ¢ÂÂt infected with HIV.   percent of men with prostate cancer who were   didnÃ¢ÂÂt get treatment, compared with 7 percent of men uninfected with HIV. Cancer treatment was defined as radiation, chemotherapy   surgery. Ã¢ÂÂTo have made such great strides with treating HIV only to have them succumb to cancer is devastating,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Gita Suneja, a radiation oncologist at the University of UtahÃ¢ÂÂs Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City and the lead author of the study. The study used the National Cancer Data Base to analyze treatment for adults younger than 65 who were diagnosed with any of the 10 most common cancers to affect HIV patients between 2003 and 2011. The study included 10, 265   adults and 2. 2 million without HIV. The database, which is sponsored by the American Cancer Society and the American College of Surgeons, captures roughly 70 percent of newly diagnosed cancer cases in the United States. The study noted that more than a third of the patients with HIV had stage 4 cancer  Ã¢ÂÂ   cancer that has metastasized  Ã¢ÂÂ   when they were diagnosed, while only 19 percent of those without HIV did. Improvements in antiretroviral therapy to treat HIV have helped reduce the incidence of cancers such as Kaposi sarcoma that are closely linked to AIDS. But rates for other cancers often associated with normal aging have increased among HIV patients. In addition, people with HIV have a higher incidence of some   cancers, such as lung cancer, which could be linked to higher rates of smoking. Cancer is now the second most common cause of death among   people, behind   causes. HIV patients are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured, and lack of coverage can affect access to cancer care. But having insurance didnÃ¢ÂÂt eliminate the problem: Privately insured people with HIV were significantly more likely to be untreated for many cancers than were privately insured people without HIV, the study found. Ã¢ÂÂWe know that people with Medicaid or who are uninsured receive subpar cancer treatment, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs a big public health issue,Ã¢ÂÂ said Suneja. Ã¢ÂÂBut even factoring that in,   people are still less likely to receive cancer treatment. That means there are other drivers that we couldnÃ¢ÂÂt measure in the study.Ã¢ÂÂ Disparities in cancer treatment could exist for several reasons. For one thing, for most cancers there are no national treatment guidelines for   patients, Suneja said. One of the few exceptions is anal cancer, the only cancer for which the study found little discrepancy in treatment among   and uninfected patients. According to the research, the difference among those not receiving treatment was 4. 8 percent for HIV patients versus 3. 1 percent for others. For other cancers, Ã¢ÂÂthe oncologist may pause and ask, Ã¢ÂÂDoes the HIV infection mean they shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt get standard cancer treatment?Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Suneja added.

2234,"Sharon BelvinÃ¢ÂÂs nightmare with cancer began in 2004, when she was just 22. Belvin was an avid runner but said she suddenly found she couldnÃ¢ÂÂt climb the stairs without Ã¢ÂÂa lot of difficulty breathing.Ã¢ÂÂ Eventually, after months of fruitless treatments for lung ailments like bronchitis, she was diagnosed with melanoma  Ã¢ÂÂ   a very serious skin cancer. It had already spread to her lungs, and the prognosis was grim. She had about a   chance of surviving the next six months. Ã¢ÂÂYeah, that was the turning point of life, right there,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. What Belvin didnÃ¢ÂÂt know at the time was that a revolutionary treatment for melanoma had begun testing in clinical trials. An immunologist named Jim Allison, now at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, had figured out that if the immune system was tweaked just right, it could do a better job of killing the cancer than the usual treatments. (Joe Palca worked for Allison early in both menÃ¢ÂÂs careers.) AllisonÃ¢ÂÂs treatment was still experimental, but if it worked, it had the potential to save BelvinÃ¢ÂÂs life. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs a new modality for treating cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Samuel Broder, a former director of the National Cancer Institute, says now of AllisonÃ¢ÂÂs pioneering research. Ã¢ÂÂIt used to be there were three basic treatment options for cancer  Ã¢ÂÂ   surgery, radiation and chemotherapy  Ã¢ÂÂ   or some combination of those three. ItÃ¢ÂÂs fair to say thereÃ¢ÂÂs now a fourth option.Ã¢ÂÂ AllisonÃ¢ÂÂs long search for this new kind of treatment  Ã¢ÂÂ   one that has since become a lifesaver for some cancer patients  Ã¢ÂÂ   began around a decade before Belvin got sick, when Allison was running a lab at the University of California, Berkeley. At the time, he was what you could call a research scientistÃ¢ÂÂs research scientist. He was fascinated by certain powerful cells of the immune system  Ã¢ÂÂ   T cells. A subset of white blood cells, T cells travel around the body and can Ã¢ÂÂprotect us against just about anything,Ã¢ÂÂ Allison says. T cells do recognize cancer cells, but not in a way that can eliminate the disease. Allison had been studying T cells for years, and thought that by tinkering with one key molecule on the outside of these cells, he could enhance their response to cancer, enough to eradicate the illness. He and one of his grad students ran an experiment to test the tweaked T cells on cancerous tumors in mice, and the initial results astounded them. The T cells seemed to be doing just what Allison had hoped they would do  Ã¢ÂÂ   shrink the tumors and kill the cancer. Allison repeated the experiment with more mice over his winter break. After a few tense days, the tumors again disappeared. Ã¢ÂÂThese mice were cured,Ã¢ÂÂ Allison says. Cancer cured? Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve been doing this sort of stuff for years, and IÃ¢ÂÂd never seen anything like that,Ã¢ÂÂ Allison says. Ã¢ÂÂAnd I thought, Ã¢ÂÂIf we could do that in people, this is going to be amazing.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Allison tried to persuade drugmakers to create a human version of the treatment that had worked in mice. He thought they would jump at the chance to try a new approach. But the biotech companies he met with didnÃ¢ÂÂt bite. In those days, most firms were focused on drugs that would target tumors directly, and Allison was asking them to try something very different. Ã¢ÂÂThis was targeting the immune system, not the cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Ã¢ÂÂWe werenÃ¢ÂÂt trying to kill the cancer cells. We were letting the T cells kill the cancer cells.Ã¢ÂÂ Thanks, but no thanks, the companies told him. Ã¢ÂÂI got very depressed,Ã¢ÂÂ Allison says. He was sure this was the most important work of his career, but he had to get others on board. Eventually, a scientist attending one of AllisonÃ¢ÂÂs research talks was intrigued enough to contact a pal at the biotech firm Medarex. The company had recently developed technology that could make a human version of AllisonÃ¢ÂÂs therapy, and was willing to give it a try. It took a decade, but eventually AllisonÃ¢ÂÂs big idea was ready for testing in people. A clinical trial to study the drug  Ã¢ÂÂ   now called ipilimumab, or Ippy for short  Ã¢ÂÂ   was set up at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. Allison decided he wanted to be part of this next chapter in the testing of immunotherapy, so he packed up his California lab and moved it to Sloan Kettering. As it happens, Belvin was also in New York  Ã¢ÂÂ   a patient of Dr. Jedd Wolchok at Sloan Kettering. By the fall of 2004, Belvin had run through all the treatment options available to her. Nothing had worked to control the melanoma it continued to spread dangerously throughout her body. Belvin remembers feeling sick and depressed, and says she wasnÃ¢ÂÂt even paying much attention when Wolchok walked into the exam room and suggested one last treatment. Ã¢ÂÂSharon, we have an opportunity to participate in a clinical trial here. ItÃ¢ÂÂs something you should consider,Ã¢ÂÂ Wolchok told her. Belvin says she signed up without hesitation. After just four injections of Ippy across three months, her cancer was nearly gone. And at BelvinÃ¢ÂÂs   appointment a year later, Wolchok delivered news that was hard for her to take in: Ã¢ÂÂSharon, you no longer have cancer.Ã¢ÂÂ And in the next breath, Belvin recalls, Ã¢ÂÂhe goes, Ã¢ÂÂOh, the guy who invented this is upstairs. Do you want to meet him?Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂYes, of course I want to meet him!Ã¢ÂÂ she told her doctor. Wolchok called Allison, who was working nearby, and told him to drop everything and come to the clinic  Ã¢ÂÂ   a part of the hospital Allison had rarely seen. Though the research scientist couldnÃ¢ÂÂt imagine why Wolchok was in such a rush, he quickly figured it out as he opened the door and was greeted by Belvin with a huge hug. Belvin says she tried not to tackle him. Ã¢ÂÂIt was hard to control myself,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. Ã¢ÂÂI owe this man my life.Ã¢ÂÂ Belvin was the first recipient of the immunotherapy that Allison had ever met. Ã¢ÂÂIt really meant a lot,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Ã¢ÂÂIt reminded me what itÃ¢ÂÂs all about at the end of the day.Ã¢ÂÂ That was in 2005 today, Sharon Belvin is still  . Ippy is now sold under the brand name Yervoy by   Squibb, which bought Medarex in 2009. Meanwhile, Jim Allison has become a bit of a celebrity in the cancer research world. Among other honors, he was a 2015 recipient of the prestigious Lasker Award for his achievements in medical science. HeÃ¢ÂÂs become   among patients, too. Now and again, Allison fields calls from patients yearning to learn from the master himself what it will take to cure their disease. Allison canÃ¢ÂÂt really answer them. Each case is different, and using a patientÃ¢ÂÂs own cells to destroy tumors wonÃ¢ÂÂt work in every patient or in every type of cancer. Still, the approach offers promise to some people that other therapies canÃ¢ÂÂt, and has transformed the way doctors think about cancer treatment. It might be too early to say weÃ¢ÂÂre going to cure cancer, Allison says, Ã¢ÂÂbut weÃ¢ÂÂre going to cure certain types of cancers. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got a shot at it now.Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,A ScientistÃ¢ÂÂs Dream Fulfilled: Harnessing The Immune System To Fight Cancer,2234.0,2234.0,234.0,
2235,"In 1975, I was living in San Diego and needed a job. The roommate of a friend of mine was a scientist at Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation. He said a colleague of his was looking to hire a lab technician, so I applied and got the job. The scientist I worked for was some guy from a small town in Texas. His name? Jim Allison. Jim has invented a new kind of cancer therapy that enables patientsÃ¢ÂÂ own immune systems to fight off their disease. HeÃ¢ÂÂs won all kinds of awards for his work, and some say heÃ¢ÂÂll win the Nobel Prize before long. But in 1975, he was just my boss. I spent a year under JimÃ¢ÂÂs direction concentrating a protein called   from human serum. The idea was to get enough of it to see what amino acids it was made from.   is a part of the immune system thatÃ¢ÂÂs key to rejecting any foreign substances that enter the body. But Jim was also my pal. We ate lunch together almost every day. WeÃ¢ÂÂd go drinking together after work. We were regulars at a   called the Stingaree that had live music. Jim was particularly fond of outlaw country music  Ã¢ÂÂ   artists like Waylon Jennings, Jerry Jeff Walker, Kris Kristofferson, Gary P. Nunn and especially Willie Nelson. Jim was a nut about Nelson. One night, he crashed a record party being held in San Diego for NelsonÃ¢ÂÂs album Red Headed Stranger. Never shy, Jim went over and talked to Nelson, told him he was a fellow Texan and how much he liked his music. Nelson asked Jim if there was someplace he and the band could play after the party, so Jim took them up to the Stingaree, where it was open mic night. Nelson and the band played until the bar closed. They even let Jim sit in with his harmonica on a set or two. Jim was on cloud nine for at least a week after that night. Although Jim liked to party, he was all business at work. He was always ready to talk science. He was also competitive and was eager to publish results ahead of other scientists working on  . I left my job with Jim in 1976 to pursue my own doctorate degree. When I later became a science journalist, Jim and I would bump into each other occasionally. He once tried to explain to me about the work he was doing with the immune system and cancer, but I have to confess I didnÃ¢ÂÂt grasp its importance. When Rebecca Davis and I went to interview Jim in his lab at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, where he now works, he was keen to tell me about his work, but equally keen to tell me about something that had just landed in his lap. Mickey Raphael, who plays harmonica in Willie NelsonÃ¢ÂÂs band, had read about Jim (and his promising cancer therapy) in a Texas paper. The article mentioned JimÃ¢ÂÂs fondness for Nelson, and that he had once played with the band back in the Ã¢ÂÂ70s. Raphael was appreciative of JimÃ¢ÂÂs work because he had lost his wife to cancer, and wanted to do something nice for Jim. So in what Raphael described as Ã¢ÂÂa reverse Make a WishÃ¢ÂÂ move, he asked Jim to sit in again with the band when they played a gig in Houston. You can see the results. If Jim does win the Nobel Prize one of these days, I can tell you that appearing on stage with the king of Sweden to receive the prize is not likely to eclipse the pleasure Jim got from appearing on stage with Willie Nelson.",cancer,Cancer Scientist Jams With Willie Nelson One More Time,2235.0,2235.0,235.0,
2236,"Ã¢ÂÂBig dataÃ¢ÂÂ is a very   kind of buzzword, which ambiguously invokes the idea of using large sets of data to draw   conclusions about trends, patterns and correlations, often about people and their behavior. But if you wanted to trace the origin of using big data for health research, youÃ¢ÂÂd have to go back  Ã¢ÂÂ   way back, to   England. There, youÃ¢ÂÂll find a haberdasher by the name of John Graunt, who undertook a peculiar project. He began to study   bills of mortality, death records kept during the   times, and compiled death details into tables, noting age, gender, cause, location and time. This vital statistics research later turned into a 1662 tome. It marked a seminal moment in demography, the statistical study of populations, but also in epidemiology, the study of what causes diseases and how they spread among different groups of people. Ã¢ÂÂIt was totally groundbreaking for its time. It was a much larger scale of looking at trends in disease than anyone had looked at previously,Ã¢ÂÂ says Stephen Mooney, an epidemiologist at Columbia UniversityÃ¢ÂÂs Mailman School of Public Health. Ã¢ÂÂAt some point you have to think about what it means to put together a table and look at patterns in  Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Ã¢ÂÂFor the time, that was big data.Ã¢ÂÂ Of course, the groundbreaking big data of today is a far cry from   tables. It allows researchers to use   computers to query billions of digital records we leave in our wake on social media, on our wearable devices, in our search history  Ã¢ÂÂ   our Ã¢ÂÂdigital exhaust,Ã¢ÂÂ as Boston ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital Chief Innovation Officer John Brownstein puts it. And isnÃ¢ÂÂt that a good thing? The promise of big data for modern health is much extolled. This week came the latest feat. Scientists at Microsoft published a study showing that Web search queries (on MicrosoftÃ¢ÂÂs Bing search engine) may hold clues to a future diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, one of the fastest and most fatal. In essence what Microsoft researchers did was this: They studied millions of anonymized searches on MicrosoftÃ¢ÂÂs Bing to find queries suggestive of a userÃ¢ÂÂs recent diagnosis, such as Ã¢ÂÂWhy did I get cancer in pancreasÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂJust diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.Ã¢ÂÂ They then backtracked the digital footprints left by the same computer to locate searches for earlier symptoms of the disease, and to create a statistical model that they say could predict 5 percent to 15 percent of the ultimate diagnoses based on earlier search activity, with pretty low false positives. Ã¢ÂÂMy take is that itÃ¢ÂÂs exciting but preliminary,Ã¢ÂÂ says Mooney, who has studied the use of big data in public health. Ã¢ÂÂThe potential benefit is huge,Ã¢ÂÂ he says, but Ã¢ÂÂit would be easy to naively assume we know more about this than we do.Ã¢ÂÂ ItÃ¢ÂÂs one thing to detect early digital clues to a diagnosis, but another to actually prevent or delay a death. The Microsoft scientists themselves acknowledge this in the study. Ã¢ÂÂClinical trials are necessary to understand whether our learned model has practical utility, including in combination with other screening methods,Ã¢ÂÂ they write. Therein lies the crux of this big data future: ItÃ¢ÂÂs a logical progression for the modern   world, but one that will continue to require the solid grounding of a traditional health professional, to steer data toward usefulness, to avoid unwarranted anxiety or even unnecessary testing, and to zero in on actual causes, not just correlations within particular health trends. Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs why I think, if you talk to a lot of epidemiologists, they may be suspicious of some of these big   approaches,Ã¢ÂÂ says Mooney, Ã¢ÂÂbecause theyÃ¢ÂÂd be concerned that thereÃ¢ÂÂs a loss of attention to causation.Ã¢ÂÂ The most   lesson in failed causation was Google Flu Trends. In 2008, Google researchers decided to measure flu activity, in real time, based on usersÃ¢ÂÂ Web searches. It was a   project and worked well  Ã¢ÂÂ   for a while. Academic researchers who later did a postmortem on the project, David Lazer and Ryan Kennedy, wrote in Wired magazine: Ã¢ÂÂGFT failed  Ã¢ÂÂ   and failed spectacularly  Ã¢ÂÂ   missing at the peak of the 2013 flu season by 140 percent. . .. Ã¢ÂÂWhile GoogleÃ¢ÂÂs efforts in projecting the flu were well meaning, they were remarkably opaque in terms of method and data  Ã¢ÂÂ   making it dangerous to rely on Google Flu Trends for any  . Ã¢ÂÂFor example, GoogleÃ¢ÂÂs algorithm was quite vulnerable to overfitting to seasonal terms unrelated to the flu, like Ã¢ÂÂhigh school basketball.Ã¢ÂÂ . .. There were bound to be searches that were strongly correlated by pure chance, and these terms were unlikely to be driven by actual flu cases or predictive of future trends.Ã¢ÂÂ The projectÃ¢ÂÂs failure, however, does not negate the promise of big data in health. Beyond analyses of   trends, capturing passively created data on peopleÃ¢ÂÂs sentiments, mental ups and downs, things you may not ever think to bring up with your physician can be Ã¢ÂÂvery powerful,Ã¢ÂÂ Brownstein says. (Of course, with proper privacy and security protections in mind.) Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs not data that can be used in a silo, itÃ¢ÂÂs one gear in the system,Ã¢ÂÂ he says, Ã¢ÂÂso itÃ¢ÂÂs not like this holy grail. ItÃ¢ÂÂs just data that can be used, that can be harnessed, in conjunction with other types of information strains.Ã¢ÂÂ To Mooney, Google Flu Trends was a case of a hype cycle, Ã¢ÂÂthis concept that technologies get overhyped and then are disappointing, but sometime after the disappointment, can often return to a sort of plateau of usefulness.Ã¢ÂÂ And in that is a lesson on big data in health: It deserves both enthusiasm and caution. Ã¢ÂÂIdeally, IÃ¢ÂÂd like people to embrace both of them,Ã¢ÂÂ says Mooney, Ã¢ÂÂto recognize that itÃ¢ÂÂs exciting and concerning at the same time.

2237,"If coffee is your favorite morning    read on. The World Health OrganizationÃ¢ÂÂs cancer research agency has given coffee the green light. The group concludes that coffee does not pose a cancer risk, and experts say a regular coffee habit may even be protective of good health. So, youÃ¢ÂÂd never heard that there had been concern of a cancer risk from coffee? Yeah, that makes lots of us. In 1991, the World Health OrganizationÃ¢ÂÂs International Agency for Research on Cancer listed coffee as a possible carcinogen. This classification was based on what the IARC says was Ã¢ÂÂlimited evidenceÃ¢ÂÂ that coffee was associated with a higher risk of bladder cancer. But over the past 25 years, the body of evidence has pointed in a new direction. Ã¢ÂÂMany epidemiological studies now available showed that coffee drinking had no carcinogenic effects for cancers,Ã¢ÂÂ the IARC statement concludes. Researchers reviewed more than 500 studies on more than 20 different types of cancers. The group concludes that coffee may in fact help protect against the risk of cancers of the liver and uterus. In addition, coffee consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer in a number of studies. As weÃ¢ÂÂve reported, a regular coffee habit has also been linked to longevity and a reduced risk of diabetes. One word of caution: The agency warns that extremely hot beverages may increase the risk of cancer. For instance, the group looked at studies from South America where mate is consumed at very hot temperatures. Ã¢ÂÂEpidemiological studies found that cancer of the esophagus is associated with drinking mate at very hot temperatures but not with drinking mate warm or cold,Ã¢ÂÂ the IARC concludes. The researchers also point to studies of tea in Asian countries, including China, that found the risk of esophageal cancer may increase with temperature. The group concludes that the   effects probably occur at drinking temperatures of 150 degrees Fahrenheit and above. So, enjoy that cup of Joe  Ã¢ÂÂ   but not too hot.",cancer,"Java Lovers, Rejoice: Coffee DoesnÃ¢ÂÂt Pose A Cancer Risk, WHO Panel Says",2237.0,2237.0,237.0,

Ã¢ÂÂI was, like, maybe 8, 9 years old . .. and I got to sing Ã¢ÂÂSilent Night,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ she tells Fresh Air host Terry Gross. Jones remembers audience members taking note of her performance. Ã¢ÂÂRight then and there,Ã¢ÂÂ she says, Ã¢ÂÂI knew that I was going to be a singer. God had blessed me with a gift.Ã¢ÂÂ Now the lead singer for the soul group, The   Jones is inspired by the classic soul and RB she grew up with. The band, which recorded its first album in 2001, is known for its energetic showmanship and Ã¢ÂÂ  soul revue shows. In 2013, Jones was forced to take a hiatus from performing after she was diagnosed with stage 2 pancreatic cancer. A new documentary, Miss Sharon Jones! by Academy   filmmaker Barbara Kopple, follows Jones in the first seven months following her diagnosis. Jones says that while extensive surgery and chemotherapy took a lot out of her, her desire to make music never faltered. After finishing chemo, recovering from the surgery and getting clean scans, she returned to the stage with The   in 2014. The cancer has since returned, but Jones wants to continue making music. Ã¢ÂÂThis cancer is here, and I have to take the chemo,Ã¢ÂÂ she says, Ã¢ÂÂbut I want to perform. I just want to be able to get onstage and move.Ã¢ÂÂ On not listening to music while she was sick, I didnÃ¢ÂÂt. I didnÃ¢ÂÂt. Because I couldnÃ¢ÂÂt sing. I couldnÃ¢ÂÂt get air because, people didnÃ¢ÂÂt realize, I was cut across the diaphragm, all the way up from right under the center under my breasts, all the way down to the top of my navel, almost. They had to cut through the diaphragm, through the stomach, remove stuff. They removed like 10 pounds of things . .. 10 pounds that I never gained back. On when she realized that she would eventually get back onstage  I had a February date, and my goal was to be back at that date. And everything in the filming, thereÃ¢ÂÂs a scene with the church scene, that was my first time even attempting to sing after months. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs when I knew, from the church scene, that I was ready. I was going to be ready for February. I knew I was going to have the strength. I knew that sickness wasnÃ¢ÂÂt unto to death. I thought I was going to die maybe a couple of hours after the doctor hit me with everything. You know, you go through that. So for a couple of hours I was on my deathbed. But other than that, I overcame that. Doing the film was also my therapy, and I knew that it would help someone out there with cancer, or going through it, as long as I inspired someone. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs where my health came from, my energy came from, knowing my fans was out there and IÃ¢ÂÂm getting back to them, and I wanted them to see what IÃ¢ÂÂm going through. On getting back onstage the first time after her treatment for pancreatic cancer, The night I went out there, it was a different Sharon, because the hair is gone. That energy, I mean, everyone said my energy was great, but I didnÃ¢ÂÂt feel it at all. Even now, the days on the stage IÃ¢ÂÂm just not myself, I donÃ¢ÂÂt have that energy. The legs doesnÃ¢ÂÂt lift up like I want to with the pain, the neuropathy from certain chemo. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a hinder, but I do the shows, but itÃ¢ÂÂs not the same. On how she and   songwriter Gabriel Roth create songs together  I just take the music and hear his idea and then I go with it from there. You know, basically he gives me what he thinks, but I have to do it my way, because IÃ¢ÂÂm the soul singer. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre not soul singers, so you canÃ¢ÂÂt teach me how to sing soul. You can tell me where to go, just allow me to be myself. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we have there with these guys. A couple of times they got in they thought they had to try to give me some tracks and stuff, and I nipped that in the bud right away. Listening to somebody else singing, IÃ¢ÂÂm trying to go where they goinÃ¢ÂÂ and thatÃ¢ÂÂs not where I would go. I would go nowhere, sing that song.

2239,"A bone from a human ancestor that died between 1. 8 million and 1. 6 million years ago shows evidence of cancer, a newly published study finds. It is the oldest known example of a malignant tumor in a human ancestor. The bone belonged to a hominin, an extinct relative of modern humans that lived and died in what is now South Africa. The foot bone, specifically the metatarsal that runs between the ankle and the pinky toe, was originally excavated between 1960 and 1980 from the Swartkrans cave, part of a World Heritage Site in South Africa called the Cradle of Humankind for its many hominin bones. But a malignant tumor in the bone was not immediately apparent. A doctoral student in Florida originally examined the bone as part of an unpublished thesis and noticed the apparent tumor, but concluded it was just a kind of benign mass known as an osteoid osteoma. It wasnÃ¢ÂÂt until two scientists at the Radiography and Tomography Section of the South African Nuclear Energy Corp. examined the bone with a     technique that the conclusion was   the researchers write in their paper published today. They scanned the bone in sections, and another team at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg assembled the images of those sections into a detailed   image. In the   cross section, it was clear the mass was not benign. It was a malignant cancer with an Ã¢ÂÂirregular spongy woven bone texture with a   external appearance,Ã¢ÂÂ the authors write. As for what kind of bone cancer, exactly, this human ancestor suffered from, the researchers are not sure, but their best guess is that it was some variety of osteosarcoma. Today, the American Cancer Society says osteosarcoma is the most common type of cancer that develops in bones. This tumor is far from the earliest example of cancer. Evidence of malignant tumors has been found in dinosaur bones. Many scientists believe tumors, which are the result of uncontrolled cell growth, have been around as long as multicellular organisms. Nor is todayÃ¢ÂÂs study alone in its finding that cancer is an ancient affliction, rather than a modern scourge caused by polluted environments and poor diets. Egyptian mummies have turned up evidence of prostate cancer from thousands of years ago. Another osteosarcoma appeared in the skull of a medieval man in what is now the Czech Republic. The authors of the most recent study note in their study: Ã¢ÂÂWhilst most modern human malignancies are thought to be caused by environmental agents of a chemical nature, the evidence for this is not entirely conclusive. . .. Ã¢ÂÂWhilst the explosion of malignancy incidence [today] is clearly correlated with the hazards of the modern world and increased life expectancy, primary bone tumors evidently occurred throughout history.Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,Ancient Bone Shows Evidence Of Cancer In Human Ancestor,2239.0,2239.0,239.0,
2240,"A major study about the best way to treat   breast cancer reveals that Ã¢ÂÂprecision medicineÃ¢ÂÂ doesnÃ¢ÂÂt provide unambiguous answers about how to choose the best therapy. Ã¢ÂÂPrecision doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean certainty,Ã¢ÂÂ says David Hunter, a professor of cancer prevention at HarvardÃ¢ÂÂs T. H. Chan School of Public Health. That point is illustrated in a large study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, involving decisions about chemotherapy. As is true for many cancers, breast cancer responds best to treatment when it is caught early, before it has spread throughout the body. Dr. Fatima Cardoso, the studyÃ¢ÂÂs lead author and a breast cancer specialist at the Champalimaud Clinical Center in Lisbon, Portugal, says that creates a conundrum for doctors and patients alike. Because itÃ¢ÂÂs the only opportunity to cure the cancer, Ã¢ÂÂwhen in doubt we tend to treatÃ¢ÂÂ women with   breast cancer, she told Shots. Ã¢ÂÂSo we know that we overtreat the patients with early breast cancer.Ã¢ÂÂ That means that women could end up undergoing chemotherapy even if it wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt really improve their survival odds. Hoping to refine those treatment decisions, Cardoso helped organize a huge study throughout Europe to see whether a commercially available genetic test called MammaPrint could help reduce that overtreatment. More than 6, 600 women participated at 112 institutions in nine nations. Scientists identified women with breast cancer whose physical exams suggested they were at relatively high risk for having the cancer return eventually after surgery, but who seemed to be at low risk of recurrence based on the genetic test results. They were invited to participate in the study, which would randomly assign them to have chemotherapy or not. Ã¢ÂÂYou know that chemotherapy is a treatment that scares people, so overall and for the majority of patients, it was not difficult to convince them,Ã¢ÂÂ Cardoso says. The genomic test, which studies 70 distinct features of a tumor, did a pretty good job of predicting who was at low risk for recurrence of breast cancer and could therefore avoid the pain, discomfort and risks of chemotherapy. (The test, priced at $4, 200, is covered by some insurance in the United States.) The scientists found that 46 percent of women who were deemed to be at high risk of recurrence based on physical symptoms could actually skip chemotherapy with little consequence to their   survival. But the test results werenÃ¢ÂÂt always definitive. About 95 percent of women who skipped chemotherapy as a result of the genetic test results were free of metastasis five years later, but those who had the additional treatment did about 1. 5 percentage points better, give or take. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs possible that the benefit is zero, and itÃ¢ÂÂs possible thatÃ¢ÂÂs 2 percent or maybe even a little more, you canÃ¢ÂÂt be sure,Ã¢ÂÂ says Dr. Clifford Hudis, chief executive officer of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. He was not involved in the European study but   an editorial accompanying it. It would take another huge clinical trial to figure out whether chemotherapy does in fact add a small survival advantage. But the study raises a bigger point here: The genomic test, as precise as it is, offers only probabilities, not absolute guidance. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs a lesson that applies to the whole new realm of precision medicine, which is billed as potentially transformative for medical care. Ã¢ÂÂThe new tools will definitely be helpful, but they often will pose challenges about what the right decision is,Ã¢ÂÂ says Hunter, who wrote a perspective piece noting that people will need to develop a tolerance for uncertainty when using precision medicine tests. Is it worth all the trouble of chemotherapy for women who are found to be at low risk for recurrence in this genomic test? ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a tough call, because it requires grasping the rather abstract idea of improving survival odds by maybe just 1 percentage point. Ã¢ÂÂAs humans, weÃ¢ÂÂre notoriously poor at assessing risk and making those calculations,Ã¢ÂÂ Hunter says. He says doctors and patients need better tools to understand and communicate the subtleties that are inherent in precision medicine. Cardoso is already seeing this play out in her clinic. Women shown to be at low genetic risk on the MammaPrint test are usually opting not to have chemotherapy after their surgery. Ã¢ÂÂBut there always [are] some patients for whom 1 percent benefit is enough  Ã¢ÂÂ   and you need to respect the wishes of each individual patient.Ã¢ÂÂ She says the women clearly benefit from the new information, even though it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt provide an absolute answer.",cancer,Study Of Breast Cancer Treatment Reveals Paradox Of Precision Medicine,2240.0,2240.0,240.0,
2241,"When DNA colon cancer screening tests find abnormalities, are patients discouraged about getting more diagnostic testing because of costs they will incur? And why do hospitals sometimes send a second bill for treatments given in a doctorÃ¢ÂÂs office? Here are the answers. A   DNA test to screen for colon cancer is available that is readily paid for by health plans, including Medicare. But if I have a positive Cologuard test result, IÃ¢ÂÂd have to pay several hundred dollars for a regular diagnostic colonoscopy. DoesnÃ¢ÂÂt this discourage people from getting screened for colon cancer, which is the goal, after all? Patient advocates point to several reasons people may be discouraged from getting tested for colorectal cancer, including the Ã¢ÂÂickÃ¢ÂÂ factor and the time it takes to prepare for and get a colonoscopy, the most common screening test. Ã¢ÂÂBut the No. 1 factor is always cost,Ã¢ÂÂ said Caroline Powers, director of federal relations at the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. Commercial insurers and the Medicare program cover cancer screenings that are recommended by the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force without requiring any payment by patients. The task force, an independent panel of medical experts, recommends colorectal cancer screening for people from age 50 to 75. Several different types of tests get the thumbs up from the task force, including colonoscopy, in which a flexible tube with a camera is snaked through the colon from the rectum to look for polyps and other abnormalities, and   tests, including the DNA test you mention, which looks for genetic mutations associated with cancer or polyps. But, as you point out, thereÃ¢ÂÂs a potential hitch. If you get a positive test result from a DNA test or other screening method, youÃ¢ÂÂll need to get a   colonoscopy to check whether the test result was correct. Patient advocates have argued that the   colonoscopy should be provided without   by patients, and doctors tell them that some private insurers are beginning to handle the process that way, Powers said. But in Medicare that   test is still considered diagnostic, and seniors are responsible for any deductible and coinsurance charges. Patient advocates continue to lobby for a change to that policy. Ã¢ÂÂFrom a public health perspective, it goes against everything weÃ¢ÂÂre trying to do,Ã¢ÂÂ Powers said. I have carpal tunnel syndrome in both wrists. I visited a hand surgeon at his office who gave me a cortisone shot in my right wrist. His bill was $450, of which my insurance covered $420. But I also received another bill from the hospital with which his practice is affiliated that included a $1, 702 facility fee for which I have a $400  . This seems so unfair. What can I do to avoid owing that charge? There may not be much you can do after the fact. As hospitals continue recent efforts to purchase physician practices, hospital facility fees are increasingly common. In 2014, a third of doctors were either employed by a hospital or worked in practices that were at least partly owned by a hospital, an increase from 29 percent in 2012, according to a study by the American Medical Association. Even if the doctorÃ¢ÂÂs office is located across town, the physician practice essentially becomes part of the hospital, and patients are typically billed for both physician services and hospital facility charges. Starting next year, some hospital facility charges will no longer be allowed. Under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, Medicare will no longer pay hospital facility fees for outpatient services at physician offices that arenÃ¢ÂÂt located on the hospital campus. However, the change will apply only to practices that hospitals acquire after Nov. 15, 2015, and doesnÃ¢ÂÂt affect commercial insurers at all. The best way to protect yourself from unexpected facility fees is to get details from the physicianÃ¢ÂÂs office before you visit, said Richard Gundling, senior vice president at the Healthcare Financial Management Association, a group for professionals in health care finance. That way, you can make an educated decision about whether to proceed before you get a surprise bill. Ã¢ÂÂThe patient should always ask, Ã¢ÂÂWhat is my    cost for this visit? Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ My husbandÃ¢ÂÂs family physician is a member of MDVIP, one of many Ã¢ÂÂconciergeÃ¢ÂÂ practices in which a doctor or group of doctors generally charge an annual fee for faster appointments, more access to the doctor, more time with him during appointments, and preventive services during the annual wellness visit that arenÃ¢ÂÂt included in a regular Medicare annual wellness visit. Is the annual fee of $1, 650 tax deductible? The annual fee is generally tax deductible, said Roy Harris, general counsel at MDVIP. That annual fee covers the cost of an executive physical every year for members, often a checkup with extra bells and whistles such as additional tests or screenings. If people itemize their medical expenses on their income taxes, they can generally deduct the expense as a physical exam. Even if they donÃ¢ÂÂt itemize, many people get reimbursed from their flexible spending accounts or health savings accounts for the annual fee after getting their physical, Harris said. Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax and Accounting, a software and information services company, agreed, although he noted that the Internal Revenue Service hasnÃ¢ÂÂt weighed in specifically on this issue.

2242,"What if doctors could call up a computerized map that would show them how a case of cancer is likely to progress? Tumor cells can mutate in unexpected ways. And cancers can suddenly grow. For doctors, anticipating cancerÃ¢ÂÂs next moves can help guide timely, effective patient treatment. A mapping program, called PiCnIc for short, aims to help physicians in staying a step ahead of cancer and preparing   treatment plans with fewer elements of surprise. How does it work? PiCnIc Ã¢ÂÂtakes in patient data, guesses potential scenarios and tells you the most likely scenario,Ã¢ÂÂ says Bud Mishra, a professor at New York UniversityÃ¢ÂÂs Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences who led a multinational team in developing the program. PiCnIc produces maps of cancer progression in much the same way historical explorers drew maps of the Earth without satellite imaging. The program, like the explorers, draws tiny regional maps and then pieces them together like a puzzle. The program extracts the simplest pieces of information from medical data, which Mishra calls Ã¢ÂÂlittle blocks of causality.Ã¢ÂÂ They describe one stage of cancer, along with a potential outcome. Once the blocks of causality are constructed, PiCnIc examines them to retain only the likeliest paths. This process is akin to discarding poorly drawn regional maps before attempting to put together a global map. The end result is a graphical representation of the possible scenarios a cancer patient might encounter. From it, physicians can hypothesize how cancer will progress and plan accordingly. Just like a good cartographer, PiCnIc is capable of drawing all kinds of maps, as long as appropriate medical data are available. Ã¢ÂÂ[PiCnIc] is quite flexible. It can incorporate pretty much any cancer type,Ã¢ÂÂ says Nicholas Navin, a professor at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center who wasnÃ¢ÂÂt involved in the creation of PiCnIc. Navin says that PiCnIc, at its current stage of development, Ã¢ÂÂalready gives [us] enough information to be clinically useful.Ã¢ÂÂ The program can also update the maps to factor in advances in cancer research as well, says Giulio Caravagna, a computational biologist at the University of Edinburgh who participated in the research project. As new medical data become available, researchers can rerun PiCnIc with ease to generate updated maps of cancer. Ã¢ÂÂAnd there is already a pretty good amount of data, like the Cancer Genome Atlas,Ã¢ÂÂ says Caravagna. The research work was published on the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in late June. Mishra says that he plans to look into Ã¢ÂÂcommercial opportunitiesÃ¢ÂÂ for PiCnIc and collaborations with Ã¢ÂÂlarge research labsÃ¢ÂÂ to improve it. For now, though, the PiCnIc maps Ã¢ÂÂshouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be interpreted too much in making decisions for individual patient,Ã¢ÂÂ says Navin. Ã¢ÂÂWe are a little bit underpowered to comprehensively build these [maps of cancer]. .. there are still little ways to go,Ã¢ÂÂ says Ben Raphael, a computational biologist at Brown University.

2243,"Privately insured people with cancer were diagnosed earlier and lived longer than those who were uninsured or were covered by Medicaid, according to two recent studies. In one study, researchers examined data from more than 13, 600 adult patients who had glioblastoma multiforme, the most common type of malignant brain tumor, between 2007 and 2012. The other study analyzed data from more than 10, 200 adults who were diagnosed with testicular cancer between 2007 and 2011. Both studies, published online in the journal Cancer in August, relied on data from the National Cancer InstituteÃ¢ÂÂs Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. SEER tracks cancer incidence and survival in the United States. The two cancers generally progress very differently. Glioblastoma multiforme is very aggressive patients generally donÃ¢ÂÂt live much more than a year following diagnosis and the   survival rate is less than 5 percent. Conversely, testicular cancer responds well to chemotherapy even if it has spread to other parts of the body. The   survival rate overall is 95 percent. But regardless of cancer type, patients with private insurance had a survival advantage. In the testicular cancer study, uninsured patients were 26 percent more likely to be diagnosed with metastatic disease (meaning their cancer had spread elsewhere) than privately insured patients. Medicaid patients were 62 percent more likely to have metastatic disease. Though the Medicaid patients fared worse than the uninsured patients in this regard, that might be because, until recently, some of them, too, had been uninsured, the researchers say, and only enrolled in Medicaid after their cancer was diagnosed. Compared to privately insured men in the study, uninsured men were 88 percent more likely to die of the cancer, and Medicaid patients were 51 percent more likely to die of the disease. A similar pattern emerged in the glioblastoma multiforme study. Patients who were either uninsured or on Medicaid were more likely to have a larger tumor at the time of diagnosis. An uninsured patient was 14 percent more likely to have a shorter survival time than someone who was privately insured, while a patient on Medicaid was 10 percent more likely to have a shorter survival time, the study found. There were some treatment differences, as well, between the patients with private insurance, and those who either had Medicaid or were uninsured. And those treatment differences could affect survival. Ã¢ÂÂWe were expecting that the uninsured would do worse than insured patients, but we didnÃ¢ÂÂt expect that Medicaid patients would do significantly worse than [privately insured] patients,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dr. Wuyang Yang, a research fellow at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who   the study about patients with brain tumors. Sarah C. Markt, the lead author on the testicular cancer study, says she found the Medicaid results in their study striking as well. The findings indicate that eliminating disparities in cancer care requires more than just expanding Medicaid coverage, says Markt, a research associate in cancer epidemiology at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. Under the health law, roughly   of states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid coverage to adults with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (about $16, 400). Ã¢ÂÂThese are young men dying of a potentially curable disease,Ã¢ÂÂ Markt says.

2244,"It was in 1909 that Nobel   German physician Paul Ehrlich proposed the idea that our bodies are fighting constant battles with cancer and that, thankfully, most of the time we win. Ehrlich was a visionary in recognizing the interaction between cancer and the immune system. Specifically, that cancerous cells are continuously arising in the body but that our immune defenses in many if not most cases keep them at bay. Now, after his and related ideas sputtered along for decades, the theory is at the core of one of oncologyÃ¢ÂÂs hottest areas, immunotherapy, or the mobilization of the human immune system to fight malignancy. Few would argue that in just the past few years this field has begun to transform cancer care. Newly approved immunotherapies have increased treatment options and improved patientsÃ¢ÂÂ odds for a variety of tumors, while also allowing many with cancer to avoid, cut back on or delay chemotherapy. Former President Jimmy CarterÃ¢ÂÂs successful treatment for melanoma, including a regimen of immunotherapy along with radiation therapy and surgery, helped push the approach into the public spotlight. Yet immunotherapy has faced some prominent setbacks. In August a clinical trial of the   Squibb drug Opdivo, or nivolumab, for a group of patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer, unexpectedly failed as a   therapy. The announcement shaved $20 billion off the value of   in a single day. Though immunotherapy is generally more tolerable than chemotherapy and radiation, there are side effects to consider. Immunotherapies can cause symptoms like fatigue, nausea and diarrhea and a recent case report review revealed a possible link between the medications and chronic arthritis. And then thereÃ¢ÂÂs the staggering cost, with some immunotherapies running well over $100, 000 a year. The immunotherapy drug Yervoy, also from   is priced at $157. 46 per milligram. Ã¢ÂÂTo put that into perspective, thatÃ¢ÂÂs approximately 4, 000 times the cost of gold,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Leonard Saltz, of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said at last yearÃ¢ÂÂs American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting. Perhaps the biggest question of all about immunotherapies is why donÃ¢ÂÂt more people respond to them. Data presented at this yearÃ¢ÂÂs American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting in April showed that over   of patients with malignant melanoma who were treated with Opdivo were still alive after five years, more than double the   survival rate for metastatic melanoma patients diagnosed between 2005 and 2011 who were treated with standard cancer therapies of the day. Yet as the AACR points out on its blog, Ã¢ÂÂDespite the obvious cause for excitement, this means that about   of patients with metastatic melanoma who were treated with [Opdivo] had cancer that did not respond to the immunotherapeutic or progressed after initially responding.Ã¢ÂÂ And response rates for other tumors tend to be markedly lower: in lung cancer, for example, they hover around 20 percent. Oncologists and scientists are now faced with determining why some patients respond and others donÃ¢ÂÂt, and also how to better predict which treatments are best for which patients. Equally important is understanding how the new treatments should be used with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation and whether or not, at least in some cases, immunotherapies can replace these more established options altogether. Mobilizing the immune system, In 2016, over a century after Ehrlich first proposed his ideas, immunotherapy takes many forms: There are cancer vaccines, antibody therapies, and drugs that drive the immune system to fight off cancer. But two newer immunotherapy approaches are generating particular buzz. The first involves engineering a patientÃ¢ÂÂs own white blood cells to recognize and attack tumor cells. Called Ã¢ÂÂCAR   therapy,Ã¢ÂÂ itÃ¢ÂÂs still experimental. But it has had some early success for blood cancers like leukemia. Further along are   checkpoint inhibitor therapies. Normally our bodies have what are called immune checkpoints, mechanisms that restrain immune activity so our bodies donÃ¢ÂÂt attack our own tissues or get overly aggressive when fighting infection. The only problem is that cancer can   these off switches by sending out molecular signals that shut down our defenses. Checkpoint inhibitor drugs interrupt the signals cancers use to shield them from the immune system. While earlier immunotherapies broadly activate the immune system, these newer agents specifically boost the activity of a subtype of white blood cell called   which when activated can zero in on and destroy cancer cells. The improved selectivity reduces collateral damage and side effects. There are now four checkpoint inhibitors approved for various cancers  Ã¢ÂÂ   including certain lung and kidney cancers, melanoma and most recently bladder cancer  Ã¢ÂÂ   with trials underway in nearly every major tumor type. In addition to Opdivo, trial data presented at this yearÃ¢ÂÂs ASCO annual meeting in June found another checkpoint inhibitor called Keytruda to be effective in advanced melanoma patients. Of the 655 patients in the study, 40 percent were still alive after three years. Other data presented at the meeting suggest that immunotherapies hold promise in a number of    cancers, including including advanced lung, kidney, bladder and head and neck cancers and Hodgkin lymphoma. Tailoring cancer care, But where do oncologists go from here? Can patient response rates go from improved to impeccable? One way is by identifying biological markers that can predict treatment response in a specific person. Researchers from the University of California, San Francisco recently reported that melanoma patients whose immune cells have higher levels of two checkpoint proteins called   and   respond significantly better to Keytruda therapy. The group is using the finding to determine which patients are more likely to respond to the treatment. Similarly, the 15 percent to 20 percent of colorectal cancer patients with what is called an Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ subtype of tumor respond especially well to immunotherapy. Another, perhaps more grueling method of improving patient response to immunotherapy is methodically determining how to use and sequence the new drugs with the vast armory of other cancer treatment options  Ã¢ÂÂ   and whether, in some cases, they could replace unpleasant stalwarts like chemo altogether. Ã¢ÂÂIn melanoma this has pretty much already happened in many cases. WeÃ¢ÂÂre often using these drugs as   therapy,Ã¢ÂÂ says Dr. Elizabeth Buchbinder, an oncologist at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. Ã¢ÂÂHowever in other tumors itÃ¢ÂÂs a lot more variable and I think in general these will be something to consider alongside the other treatments.Ã¢ÂÂ Buchbinder explains that while melanoma patients treated with a single checkpoint inhibitor see response rates between 30 percent and 40 percent, those rates climb to 60 percent when a second immunotherapy is added. Ã¢ÂÂI think these will become part of a combination of strategies,Ã¢ÂÂ concurs   oncologist Marcel van den Brink. Ã¢ÂÂJust look at chemo. There are almost no situations where one chemotherapy alone would even come close to curing a cancer of any type. The big breakthroughs here came when we carefully figured out combination therapies.Ã¢ÂÂ Improving cancer outcomes will involve personalizing care in a variety of ways. After all, each of our bodies operates  Ã¢ÂÂ   and falls ill  Ã¢ÂÂ   at the hands of its own exclusive biology. But van den Brink is hopeful about the possibility of profiling the microbiota to determine how certain bacteria in the gut can influence cancer immunotherapy. Ã¢ÂÂThe biome can stimulate   all over the body,Ã¢ÂÂ he explains. Ã¢ÂÂMaybe we can come up with a strategy to foster a particular type of bacteria in a particular patient that improves treatment response.Ã¢ÂÂ Genetic interventions will also play an increasing role in customizing cancer care. By sequencing not only the genomes of patients, but those of their tumors and even their immune cells specifically, oncologists will be better able to determine which treatments will work best in which patients. University of Chicago oncologist Jason Luke says oncologists are already trying this. Ã¢ÂÂEven now we can use genetic techniques to look at which genes are turned on in the cancer tissue and to tell us whether immunotherapy is likely to work or not,Ã¢ÂÂ he says, explaining that this technique could help identify patients whose immune system is already Ã¢ÂÂprimed for attackÃ¢ÂÂ and may need only an immunotherapeutic nudge, versus those that might also require chemo and radiation. Luke also believes that tinkering with DNA using genome editing technologies like CRISPR could help doctors not only excise   genes but also improve treatment efficacy. In fact, in June a federal biosafety panel approved the first study of the technique in humans  Ã¢ÂÂ   a study that aims to use the technique to augment cancer immunotherapy by genetically modifying immune cells. Ã¢ÂÂI think eventually weÃ¢ÂÂll get to the point where weÃ¢ÂÂll look at someoneÃ¢ÂÂs tumor, immune system and genetics and say, Ã¢ÂÂThis treatment is the way to go,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ foresees Buchbinder. Ã¢ÂÂI think with time, immunotherapy will be part of many, many cancer treatments.Ã¢ÂÂ Van den Brink encourages optimistic caution: Ã¢ÂÂWe need to be honest here. These therapies look very powerful and promising, but a fair number of patients donÃ¢ÂÂt respond to them upfront,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Ã¢ÂÂThese arenÃ¢ÂÂt absolute cures for most people just yet.Ã¢ÂÂ Defeating one of humanityÃ¢ÂÂs oldest scourges, he says, has years of trial and error ahead.

2245,"Tim Bauerschmidt left home when he was 19. He would call or visit his parents in Michigan occasionally. Decades went by. After his father died last year, he knew his mother couldnÃ¢ÂÂt live by herself. She was 90, and he realized he didnÃ¢ÂÂt know her that well. Ã¢ÂÂI had some stilted conversations,Ã¢ÂÂ says Bauerschmidt. Ã¢ÂÂSheÃ¢ÂÂd be on the other end of the phone when I talked to my dad. IÃ¢ÂÂd have to say, Ã¢ÂÂMom, are you there? Are you on the line?Ã¢ÂÂ [She would say] Ã¢ÂÂOh yeah, IÃ¢ÂÂm here.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Bauerschmidt says it was like his mom, Norma, lived in the shadow of his dad. The pair were married for 67 years. Two days after he died, Norma was diagnosed with endometrial cancer. The doctor recommended a hysterectomy and chemotherapy. Ã¢ÂÂShe said, Ã¢ÂÂNope, IÃ¢ÂÂm not doing any of that,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ says Ramie Liddle, BauerschmidtÃ¢ÂÂs wife. The couple offered to have Norma come live with them. But there was a catch  Ã¢ÂÂ   they live in an RV and travel full time. Liddle says Norma took about two minutes and gave them her answer. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm  Ã¢ÂÂ Liddle recalls Norma saying. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm hitting the road. LetÃ¢ÂÂs go have some fun. I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to spend another minute in the doctorÃ¢ÂÂs office.Ã¢ÂÂ Last summer, Norma, Ramie, Tim and the coupleÃ¢ÂÂs poodle, Ringo, embarked on a   adventure across the U. S. Before she was married, Norma served in the Navy. She was a nurse at a hospital in San Diego during World War II. After that, she lived in Michigan, rarely venturing far from home. When the foursome pulled away in the RV, Norma began to experience many firsts. Bauerschmidt says she had never even been to Wisconsin, the state next to Michigan. There were so many foods she never tried: buffalo burgers, fried green tomatoes, lobster and oysters. Ã¢ÂÂShe realized quickly that she loved key lime pie,Ã¢ÂÂ Liddle says. Over the course of the year, they traveled nearly 13, 000 miles and slept in over 75 locations in 32 states. They visited dozens of national parks, monuments and recreation areas. Norma even experienced some smaller things, like taking off in a hot air balloon, riding a horse and getting a pedicure. At the beginning of their trip, Liddle started to document their adventures. Ã¢ÂÂI decided to put it on Facebook,Ã¢ÂÂ Liddle says. Ã¢ÂÂI used to keep a travel blog because Tim and I were always on the road and honestly, I liked to let my mom, who lives in Pittsburgh, know where we were.Ã¢ÂÂ She named the Facebook page Ã¢ÂÂDriving Ms. Norma,Ã¢ÂÂ and after a few months, people beyond LiddleÃ¢ÂÂs mom started to take notice. A website picked up on it, and the page gained hundreds of thousands of followers. People around the world were in awe of Norma  Ã¢ÂÂ   the way Ramie and Tim were. Ã¢ÂÂI used to say Ã¢ÂÂNo,Ã¢ÂÂ to a lot of things,Ã¢ÂÂ Bauerschmidt says. Ã¢ÂÂMy knee jerk reaction to most things  Ã¢ÂÂ   no, no  Ã¢ÂÂ   but now I hold my tongue and I consider it, and IÃ¢ÂÂm saying Ã¢ÂÂYes,Ã¢ÂÂ to uncomfortable situations.Ã¢ÂÂ Norma died last week at the age of 91.

2246,"Mammography can prevent deaths from breast cancer, but itÃ¢ÂÂs not a perfect test. It misses some cancers, especially in women with dense breast tissue, and flags abnormalities for   tests that turn out to be benign, among other issues. So thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of interest in additional tests that might make screening more accurate in women who have dense breasts. Many of those women may be wondering about extra screening after receiving notification letters saying that their mammogram was clean, but that their dense breasts put them at higher risk of cancer. But there is no clear path for those women, who make up about 45 percent of women ages 40 to 74. The goal with breast imaging technology is not only to detect more cancers earlier, but to actually prevent deaths from breast cancer, says Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society. Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs a very separate and different question,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. And so far, only mammography has met that standard, he says. Investigating that question requires large, randomized clinical trials that follow women for many years to track whether the group screened with the extra technology has fewer deaths from breast cancer than the group screened with mammography alone. And that kind of trial is expensive and logistically tough. Because cancer isnÃ¢ÂÂt as common as many people think, Ã¢ÂÂthe number of women you have to screen to achieve statistical significance is huge,Ã¢ÂÂ says Barbara Monsees, a professor of radiology and womenÃ¢ÂÂs health at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. The full effects wonÃ¢ÂÂt be apparent for decades. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs a   commitment, and it costs a lot of money,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. So researcher, clinicians and policymakers who evaluate tests have to rely on studies of   outcomes like cancer detection rates and stage at detection  Ã¢ÂÂ   which may or may not translate to saved lives. They also look at what those studies say about false positive findings, since those can lead to invasive biopsies to see if cancer is actually present. The New England Comparative Effectiveness Public Advisory Council, whose members are from the fields of medicine, economics and policy, looked at the evidence supporting any kind of supplementary screening in women with dense breasts and a clear digital mammogram. Their conclusions, published in 2014, found that thereÃ¢ÂÂs not a ton of evidence on   outcomes, but that the available research suggests a net benefit depending on a personÃ¢ÂÂs underlying cancer risk from additional factors, namely age and family history of the disease. For otherwise   women with dense breasts, the New England group determined that there wasnÃ¢ÂÂt enough evidence to recommend extra screening. They mentioned the potential of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, since some percentage of breast cancers  Ã¢ÂÂ   and there is much controversy over how many  Ã¢ÂÂ   would likely never have caused a woman harm had they been left undiscovered. But for women with dense breasts who are at moderate or high risk of breast cancer according to family history and age, they voted that from the available evidence, the benefits of routine supplemental screening are more likely to outweigh the harms. If a woman and her doctor decide that supplemental screening is needed because of her risk factors, the next question is what kind of screening. There are pluses and minuses of each technology:   ultrasound devices use sound waves to visualize breast tissue. Ultrasound is often used in women with dense breasts. And research suggests that it can pick up more cancers in these women, ones missed by mammograms. Ã¢ÂÂBut thereÃ¢ÂÂs a price for that,Ã¢ÂÂ says Debra Monticciolo, chair of the American College of RadiologyÃ¢ÂÂs Commission on Breast Imaging and a professor of radiology at Texas AM University College of Medicine. There are many, many more false positives, she says, which in turn can lead to unneeded biopsies. And itÃ¢ÂÂs unclear how those benefits and harms balance out. Ã¢ÂÂDoes finding those cancers impact   outcomes? You canÃ¢ÂÂt really prove it, because all you know is that you found additional cancers,Ã¢ÂÂ says Monsees. Ã¢ÂÂCan you guess if those would translate into saved lives? Perhaps not all of them, but what percentage of them?Ã¢ÂÂ Magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, uses magnetic waves to produce images of the breast. MRI finds more cancers, but it also leads to more false positive results than mammography, although fewer than ultrasound. It requires an intravenous catheter for the contrast agent used in the test, and is more expensive than ultrasound. Most of the members of the New England group said MRI was their first choice for women with dense breasts and a high risk of cancer, citing research on its utility among   women in general. And despite the lack of direct evidence that it saves lives, the American Cancer Society recommends it be added to mammography for women at very high risk of breast cancer, including women who carry certain genetic mutations. That group says thereÃ¢ÂÂs not enough evidence to say whether women who are moderate risk or who have dense breasts should get the test, and it recommends against its use in   women. Tomosynthesis is basically a   mammogram it uses the same   to generate multiple images. ItÃ¢ÂÂs sometimes called a   mammogram. And unlike the other technologies, itÃ¢ÂÂs being suggested for use in all women, says Dr. Janie Lee, associate professor of radiology at the University of Washington and director of breast imaging at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. (Lee was one of the authors of the New England groupÃ¢ÂÂs technology assessment but not a voting member.) It can be used along with a separate   digital mammogram or a virtual   image digital mammogram image can be derived from the   one. (Using the latter technique keeps the radiation dose comparable to a standard digital mammogram.) Studies suggest that tomosynthesis may improve the cancer detection rate, lower the proportion of women who are called back for   tests, or both, says Monsees, which makes it attractive when performed with the method that produces the lower radiation dose. But it likely wonÃ¢ÂÂt significantly improve the callback rate in experienced radiologists who already have low recall rates, says Brawley. Molecular breast imaging involves injecting a radioactive tracer that circulates through the body and is attracted to cancer. Research suggests that it can pick up more tumors in women with dense breasts, and itÃ¢ÂÂs cheaper than MRI. But the doses of radiation administered are generally larger than with mammography, notes Monticciolo. And while mammography exposes just the breast to radiation, MBI exposes other organs such as the GI tract. That means that at this point, says Lee, itÃ¢ÂÂs more of a candidate for    studies against MRI for women with dense breasts who are also at high risk of the disease because of other factors. Researchers are pushing ahead to see if screening methods can be more tailored to an individual womanÃ¢ÂÂs risk. So far, though, thereÃ¢ÂÂs no proven ideal option  Ã¢ÂÂ   which means the best course of action is to know your risk, and talk to your physician about your options.

2247,"Women are less likely to die of breast cancer than they were a decade ago, but not all women are benefiting from that trend. White women saw more of a drop in death rates than black women  Ã¢ÂÂ   1. 9 percent a year from 2010 to 2014, compared to a 1. 5 percent decrease for black women, according to a report published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And while the death rates for women under 50 declined regardless of race, older black women are more likely to die of breast cancer than are white women. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs especially troubling because 40 years ago, black women were less likely to get breast cancer. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs changed. Black womenÃ¢ÂÂs breast cancer risk is now the same as that of white womenÃ¢ÂÂs, and black women are 41 percent more likely to die of the disease. There can be some good reasons for the rise in the number of black women being diagnosed with breast cancer, like more women getting screening mammograms. But there are bad reasons, too. The CDC report cites   foods, lack of exercise and increasing rates of obesity as potential reasons. And while this report found similar reductions in deaths among younger black and white women, older white women saw their death rates drop by 2 percent a year, compared to 1 percent in black women. Access to care is one big reason why, according to Otis Brawley, chief medical and scientific officer for the American Cancer Society. Ã¢ÂÂForty to 50 percent of black women get less than optimal care for breast cancer, whether itÃ¢ÂÂs mammography or treatment,Ã¢ÂÂ Brawley says. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre not alone in that poor white women are also much less likely to get adequate care, and more likely to die as a result. Ã¢ÂÂWe need to focus on getting good care,   care to everybody,Ã¢ÂÂ Brawley adds. Ã¢ÂÂWe need to realize that in the United States of America in 2016 a substantial proportion of Americans with cancer get absolutely atrocious care.Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,"Breast Cancer Death Rates Are Down, But Racial Disparities Persist",2247.0,2247.0,247.0,
2248,"Not so very long ago, colonoscopy was the gold standard for colon cancer screening. But times are  . Last month when I went in for a checkup, my primary care doctor handed me a FIT test, a colon cancer test you can do at home without the unpleasantness and risk that turn people off to colonoscopy. The FIT test, or fecal immunochemical blood test, is a newer and more accurate way to test for blood in stool, which can be a symptom of colon cancer. In June, the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force, an influential independent panel, endorsed the FIT test along with two other forms of fecal blood tests, as well as virtual colonoscopy and two invasive tests, colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy, as good ways to screen for colon cancer. The task force didnÃ¢ÂÂt play favorites rather, it emphasized that the goal was to get more people tested, since   of adults between 50 and 75 have never been screened for colon cancer. ItÃ¢ÂÂs the third most common cancer in the U. S. killing about 50, 000 people a year. Ã¢ÂÂThe idea behind most guidelines is to promote all of the screening tests equally, with the idea that within reason patients prefer a choice,Ã¢ÂÂ says Dr. David Weinberg, chairman of the department of medicine at Fox Chase Cancer Center and lead author of an opinion article published Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine. Last week, a task force from three professional societies of gastroenterologists evaluated the evidence for the FIT test, which is used in Canada and many countries in Europe and Asia as the primary form of screening. They looked at 19 studies and found that FIT identified people with cancer 79 percent of the time and those without cancer 94 percent of the time. The results were published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology. They pointed out that the FIT test is better at detecting cancer than the older guaic fecal occult blood test, or gFOBT, which requires samples from three different bowel movements. I can testify to the simplicity of the FIT test if you like arts and crafts kits, youÃ¢ÂÂll probably like the minute bottle with collection wand, which goes into a padded plastic bag, then an envelope and into the mail. Trust me, your hand will never touch poop. A few weeks later I got a letter back from my doctor, saying I had passed the test. Woohoo! But thatÃ¢ÂÂs where the question of simpler, less invasive cancer screening gets complicated. For FIT testing to be successful, you have to repeat it every year. And that means that you need a doctor who will give you the test every year, and who will make sure that if you test positive, you go get a colonoscopy to see whatÃ¢ÂÂs up. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs the first step,Ã¢ÂÂ says Dr. Douglas Robertson, chief of gastroenterology at the VA Medical Center in White River Junction, Vt. and a professor of medicine at DartmouthÃ¢ÂÂs Geisel School of Medicine. Ã¢ÂÂIt really is important to realize that when the test is positive it does need a   test.Ã¢ÂÂ Integrated care systems like the VA and Kaiser Permanente are embracing FIT testing, in part because those systems are good at repeat testing and  . ItÃ¢ÂÂs easy to let screening fall through the cracks. Ã¢ÂÂIf youÃ¢ÂÂre going to choose a noninvasive test like FIT you need to be committed to doing it annually,Ã¢ÂÂ says Robertson, who was a lead author of the new gastroenterology guidelines. And that circles back to one reason why American gastroenterologists liked colonoscopies in the first place: Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs   shopping,Ã¢ÂÂ Weinberg says. Ã¢ÂÂIf you have a precancerous polyp it almost always can be removed, and the interval between colonoscopies when appropriately selected is typically long.Ã¢ÂÂ The current recommendation for people of average risk is to have a colonoscopy every 10 years, from age 50 to about age 75. Ã¢ÂÂYou devote essentially 24 hours of your life to one every 10 years,Ã¢ÂÂ Weinberg says. Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs a pretty good deal.Ã¢ÂÂ The FIT test is a good test, Weinberg says, and it should be offered enthusiastically. Ã¢ÂÂBut at least at the primary care level, some challenges exist.Ã¢ÂÂ So is FIT as good as colonoscopy? Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs a really important question that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have a definitive answer,Ã¢ÂÂ Robertson says. HeÃ¢ÂÂs a leader of the CONFIRM trial, which will compare FIT tests to colonoscopy in 50, 000 people in the VA health care system. Ã¢ÂÂThe good news is weÃ¢ÂÂre underway with the trial,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Ã¢ÂÂThe bad news is the result wonÃ¢ÂÂt be available for over a decade. So for now the  .  decision will be, like so many decisions in health care, a complex question of access, cost, convenience and personal preference. In this case, at least, the options look pretty good.",cancer,A Noninvasive Colon Cancer Test ThatÃ¢ÂÂs FIT To Be Tried,2248.0,2248.0,248.0,
2249,"How do you get women who never talk about breast cancer to start opening up? That was the question on the mind of Usman Saleemi, who along with colleagues Tiya Fazelbhoy and Jaison Ben created a bra designed to encourage breast   among women in Pakistan. According to Pink Ribbon, a national breast cancer charity based in Lahore, Pakistan has the highest incidence of breast cancer in Asia. More than 40, 000 women lose their lives to the disease each year. But while many cases of breast cancer can be successfully treated, the very topic is taboo in Pakistan. In this conservative country, a woman may be embarrassed to bring up intimate details about her body. The taboos are especially strong in rural Pakistan, where women are valued for their ability to bear children and look after a home. A woman may ignore signs of a possible tumor and not say a word to family. She may fear that if she becomes sick sheÃ¢ÂÂll be seen as a burden. Or that if she has a mastectomy, her husband will no longer deem her attractive and will seek a divorce. As a result, cancer is often advanced  Ã¢ÂÂ   stage 3 or 4  Ã¢ÂÂ   when a woman is finally diagnosed, a common problem in   and   countries, according to Dr. Ophira Ginsburg, an oncologist and medical officer with the World Health Organization. Even if diagnosed, some of these women never return for treatment, Ginsburg adds: They either canÃ¢ÂÂt afford it or donÃ¢ÂÂt see the value if they believe that cancer is a death sentence. The breast cancer cause is close to the heart for Saleemi and Fazelbhoy. Born and raised in Pakistan, theyÃ¢ÂÂve each lost loved ones to the disease: SaleemiÃ¢ÂÂs mother and aunt, FazelbhoyÃ¢ÂÂs grandmother and aunt. Both are now based in Dubai, working for Tonic, an advertising and branding agency  Ã¢ÂÂ   Saleemi as art director and Fazelbhoy as digital account manager. When the opportunity to do some   work came up, they began focusing on how to educate women in Pakistan about breast health. They brainstormed ideas and traveled to Pakistan to do research, meeting with health groups and hospitals. There they found a partner in Pink Ribbon, as well as Dr. Rufina Soomro, a breast cancer surgeon who works with women in rural villages. They also teamed up with International Foundation  Garments, the leading manufacturer of womenÃ¢ÂÂs undergarments in Pakistan, which produces prosthetic bras for women who have had mastectomies. Like many women around the world, Pakistani women use their bras to hold money. ItÃ¢ÂÂs especially common there because the traditional clothing  Ã¢ÂÂ   the shalwar kameez  Ã¢ÂÂ   is a tunic and   trousers with no pockets. Inspired by the idea of a multitasking bra, Saleemi and Fazelbhoy came up with the Pink Bra. The Pink Bra is a simple white brassiere with pockets to store money and raised pink outlines of fingerprints showing where to press for possible lumps during a  . Instructions for breast   are printed on the bra in Urdu along with illustrations (particularly important for women who are illiterate). Also printed on the bra is a hotline number for Pink Ribbon, which women can call for support and advice on what to do if they discover a lump and where to go for testing. Then came the question of how to get the bra to women across Pakistan. Even though the goal was to keep production costs low, women in   brackets might not be willing or able to buy one. So Saleemi and Fazelbhoy hoped to encourage women from the middle and upper classes to give Pink Bras to women on their household staffs. Ã¢ÂÂWe filmed a video with a woman who had lost a maid [to breast cancer]. It was a very personal story and a difficult time for her,Ã¢ÂÂ explains Fazelbhoy. In the video, she talks about gifting her staff with Pink Bras. After several prototypes were made and tested with women, the final product was launched in May. A thousand bras were produced around 900 were given for free to doctors and nonprofit health groups. The bras were also sold on the Pink Ribbon website and in some beauty salons for $9. 50 (999 Pakistani rupees). The video of the woman talking about her maidÃ¢ÂÂs death got over 400, 000 views on Facebook. Ã¢ÂÂA lot of influencers got on board, as well as some of the actresses in Pakistan, and radio jockeys were doing a weeklong educational series on the bra and breast cancer education,Ã¢ÂÂ says Fazelbhoy. Ã¢ÂÂThose were the primary mediums, but then really it spread by word of mouth.Ã¢ÂÂ At least 5, 000 Pink Bras have now been manufactured. And what do the experts think? Dr. Soujanya Gadde, a breast radiologist working for the Prevent Breast Cancer charity in the United Kingdom, believes itÃ¢ÂÂs a good idea: Ã¢ÂÂThe Pink Bra project could be a lifesaving initiative in Pakistan. It encourages breast awareness and women to report symptoms early.Ã¢ÂÂ Lester Barr, chairman of the charity, urges caution. Ã¢ÂÂBreast awareness and   campaigns have done a lot to improve breast cancer survival here in the U. K. over the last 40 years,Ã¢ÂÂ says Barr. Ã¢ÂÂMaybe the Pink Bra project can do the same in Pakistan. We know how many locally advanced cancers present in Pakistan, so this campaign could help to reduce those numbers. But it will take a generation.Ã¢ÂÂ He also notes that   alone is not effective unless there is mass screening and treatment available as well. Dr. Ophira Ginsburg of WHO does not think the Pink Bra will make a difference: Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot that needs to happen to improve access to care [in Pakistan] and none of it includes breast  .Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂFor the women who are underprivileged, marginalized, rural, etc. you need to rapidly improve access to good quality, timely diagnosis and basic treatment. Diagnosis means biopsy, plus or minus an imaging modality such as ultrasound or mammogram if itÃ¢ÂÂs available, and pathology, which is shockingly   in many settings.Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,A Bra That Could Get People Talking About Breast Cancer,2249.0,2249.0,249.0,
2250,"Mantis shrimp, a group of aggressive,   crustaceans, take more than one   ribbon in the animal kingdom. Outwardly, they resemble their somewhat larger lobster cousins, but their colorful shells contain an impressive set of superpowers. Now, scientists are finding that one of those abilities  Ã¢ÂÂ   incredible eyesight  Ã¢ÂÂ   has implications for people with cancer that are potentially lifesaving. Ã¢ÂÂThey have these ridiculous eyes that sense so many things at once,Ã¢ÂÂ says Sam Powell, a doctoral student in computer science and engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs been very interesting figuring out what we can do with that, that helps out humans.Ã¢ÂÂ Powell is part of a collaborative team of engineers and wildlife biologists,   by Viktor Gruev at the University of Illinois at  . TheyÃ¢ÂÂre working on a set of imaging technologies inspired by the ability of the mantis shrimp to detect polarized light. With the camera the team is developing, Gruev says, cancer surgeons might one day be able to much more clearly see the margins of the tumors they need to remove. Mantis shrimp come in two varieties. There are the Ã¢ÂÂsmashersÃ¢ÂÂ and the Ã¢ÂÂspearers,Ã¢ÂÂ named for their attack modes when hunting prey. With their   weaponized legs, these predators can crack a snail shell or harpoon a passing fish in a single punch. The speed of these attacks has earned the mantis shrimp a world record: fastest strike in the animal kingdom. At 30 times faster than the blink of an eye, the attack is so swift that it can vaporize nearby water molecules, producing bubbles where no bubbles should be. The mantis shrimpÃ¢ÂÂs powerful punch is aided by its   eyesight. Like the eyes of most crustaceans and insects, the mantis shrimpÃ¢ÂÂs are made up of thousands of   facets  Ã¢ÂÂ   picture a flyÃ¢ÂÂs eye  Ã¢ÂÂ   known as ommatidia. WhatÃ¢ÂÂs unique to the mantis shrimp is the way the ommatidia of each eye are divided into three sections, each moving independently. That means mantis shrimp vision is able to triangulate distance using up to six images in the brain. Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs important for an animal that makes its living smashing and spearing things,Ã¢ÂÂ says Roy Caldwell, a mantis shrimp specialist in the integrative biology department at the University of California, Berkeley. But the power of the mantis shrimp eye doesnÃ¢ÂÂt end there. Mantis shrimp can perceive an attribute of light that eludes our naked eyes: polarization. Sunlight is messy  Ã¢ÂÂ   a jumble of wavelengths moving in all directions at once. But some surfaces  Ã¢ÂÂ   say, the scale of a fish, or a pair of polarized sunglasses  Ã¢ÂÂ   have a way of changing the light they reflect or transmit, organizing it so it moves in a single plane. We humans canÃ¢ÂÂt really tell this is happening. But the mantis shrimp eye has extra sensors that let it analyze the angle of the light wave. That means the shrimp is able to make out where in its neighborhood light is being polarized, and where it isnÃ¢ÂÂt. So the polarizing surfaces of fish, crabs and other potential prey look more vivid against the less polarized backdrop of water. This ability to detect and visually capitalize on polarized light Ã¢ÂÂis very common in animals,Ã¢ÂÂ says Thomas Cronin, a research biologist and professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Ã¢ÂÂIn fact, weÃ¢ÂÂre among the few that donÃ¢ÂÂt use polarized light very much, if at all.Ã¢ÂÂ WhatÃ¢ÂÂs unique to some mantis shrimp is their ability to perceive yet another, much more rare variety of polarized light. This Ã¢ÂÂcircularÃ¢ÂÂ polarized light moves not in a flat plane, but in a twisted one that spins through space like a helix. Circular polarized light is part of what makes   glasses and DVD technology work. Mantis shrimp not only see this kind of polarization, they broadcast it. Parts of the maleÃ¢ÂÂs body function as a   surface, flashing a secret code thatÃ¢ÂÂs only visible within the species. Ã¢ÂÂIt gives them an incredibly private channel of communication that no other animal can see,Ã¢ÂÂ says Caldwell. Males display these body parts during courtship to attract females. Other research has shown that adult males flash their polarizing parts to alert other males to their presence inside a burrow, a warning that the homeowner is armed and dangerous. Inspired by the mantis shrimpÃ¢ÂÂs superlative eyesight, the group of researchers are collaborating to build polarization cameras that could be used to help diagnose and remove cancerous tumors. Doctors have long known that, at the cellular level,   cancer cells are disorganized in comparison with healthy cells. Because of the structural differences, it turns out, some diseased tissues also reflect polarized light differently from healthy tissue. These differences can show up early with cancer  Ã¢ÂÂ   before other symptoms or signs. Ã¢ÂÂLooking at nature can help us design better and more sensitive imaging techniques,Ã¢ÂÂ Gruev says. His teamÃ¢ÂÂs cameras, which are small enough for endoscopic use, can see polarization patterns on the surfaces of human and animal tissue. In one study, Gruev and his team tested their polarization cameras in mice, looking for signs of colon cancer. Traditional colonoscopy techniques employ    images to look for abnormal shapes, such as polyps. But sometimes, cancerous tissue in the colon is flat, blending in with healthy tissue. GruevÃ¢ÂÂs camera, in contrast, successfully converted polarization data into color images in real time in the mice studies, revealing where the healthy tissue ended and the diseased tissue began. Interestingly, different types of cancer cells have different polarization signatures, Gruev says, while healthy tissues have a consistent profile. Ã¢ÂÂThe polarization structure makes the cancer apparent,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Clinical trials with human breast cancer patients are now underway. At this point, doctors have no way to confirm during the operation that theyÃ¢ÂÂve completely removed a tumor. One day, Gruev believes, polarization imaging will be part of every surgical oncologistÃ¢ÂÂs toolkit, bringing the power of a mantis shrimpÃ¢ÂÂs eye to the operating room. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs kind of the cancer moonshot,Ã¢ÂÂ Gruev says of his hopes for the diagnostic technology. Ã¢ÂÂRight now, we are still detecting cancer way too late in the game.Ã¢ÂÂ This post and video were produced by our friends at Deep Look, a wildlife video series from KQED and PBS Digital Studios that explores Ã¢ÂÂthe unseen at the very edge of our visible world.Ã¢ÂÂ KQEDÃ¢ÂÂs Elliott Kennerson is a digital media producer for the series.

2251,"Every year when Morton Pollner had his checkup, he worried that doctors would find something on his lung. For years, they didnÃ¢ÂÂt. Then his luck ran out. Ã¢ÂÂMy reaction was, Ã¢ÂÂWell, you smoked for 30 years. You got away with it for another 30 years and this is it.Ã¢ÂÂ I thought it was a death sentence,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Pollner, who lives in Monroe, N. Y. was 76 when he was diagnosed with lung cancer. Like many patients his age, he didnÃ¢ÂÂt expect there would be any effective treatment. Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in men and women. And it is mainly a disease of older people. Only about 2 percent of lung cancer patients are under 45 and the average age at diagnosis is about 70. Older patients are frequently not offered curative treatment like surgery, because they and their families and even their doctors often think they wonÃ¢ÂÂt be able to tolerate it. So they are referred for supportive care to control symptoms, rather than surgery to remove the cancer. But many patients can survive and even thrive after surgery, says Dr. Prasad Adusumilli, a thoracic surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. He was senior author of a study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in October. The study looked at more than 2, 000 patients with Stage 1   cell lung cancer who had surgery to remove their tumor. About 70 percent of the patients were 65 years old or older and about 30 percent were at least 75. And he found that a surprising number of these older patients did quite well. One year after surgery, more people had died from other causes than died from lung cancer. And, after five years, almost 9 out of 10 patients were alive and cancer free. Ã¢ÂÂThey did well and beat their lung cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ Adusumilli says, proving that when it comes to surgery for early stage lung cancer, age should not be a limiting factor. This was the case for Morton Pollner, who is one of AdusumilliÃ¢ÂÂs patients. His cancer had not spread, and Adusumilli told him there was a good possibility the cancerous tissue could be completely removed and he could go back to leading a normal life. That was seven years ago. Today, Pollner is 82, cancer free and enjoying life. Ã¢ÂÂWhatever I get from here on, itÃ¢ÂÂs like gravy,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Surgery isnÃ¢ÂÂt the answer for all older lung cancer patients, according to Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. Patients with heart or other health problems may not be candidates. At the same time, he says itÃ¢ÂÂs important to recognize that patterns of aging have changed over the past two decades. Seventy today is not the same as it was 20 years ago, Lichtenfeld says. Older adults are more functional, both physically and mentally, than ever before, and he says the medical community needs to adjust its thinking about what treatments older cancer patients can tolerate. Ã¢ÂÂWe shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt allow numerical age to be the deciding factor,Ã¢ÂÂ Lichtenfeld says.",cancer,Older Patients Can Benefit From Lung Cancer Surgery,2251.0,2251.0,251.0,
2252,"The   shapes reminded Carol Vincent of fluorescent   creatures, and they floated past her languidly. She was overwhelmed by their beauty  Ã¢ÂÂ   and then suddenly, as if in a dream, she was out somewhere in deep space instead. Ã¢ÂÂOh, wow,Ã¢ÂÂ she thought, overwhelmed all over again. She had been an amateur skydiver in her youth, but this sensation didnÃ¢ÂÂt come with any sense of speeding or falling or even having a body at all. She was just hovering there, gazing at the universe. Vincent was having a psychedelic experience, taking part in one of the two studies just published that look at whether cancer patients like her could overcome their   anxiety and depression with a single dose of psilocybin. It turned out they could, according to the studies, conducted at New York University and Johns Hopkins and reported this week in the Journal of Psychopharmacology. NYU and Hopkins scientists gave synthetic psilocybin, the hallucinogenic component of Ã¢ÂÂmagic mushrooms,Ã¢ÂÂ to a combined total of 80 people with advanced cancer suffering from depression, anxiety, and Ã¢ÂÂexistential angst.Ã¢ÂÂ At   six months or more later,   of the subjects said their anxiety and depression had pretty much disappeared after a single dose. And about 80 percent said the psilocybin experience was Ã¢ÂÂamong the most personally meaningful of their lives,Ã¢ÂÂ Roland Griffiths, a professor of psychiatry and leader of the Hopkins team, said in an interview. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs how it was for Vincent, one of the volunteers in GriffithsÃ¢ÂÂ study. By the time she found her way to Hopkins in 2014, Vincent, now 61, had been living for six years with a time bomb of a diagnosis: follicular  Ã¢ÂÂs lymphoma, which she was told was incurable. It was asymptomatic at the time except for a few enlarged lymph nodes, but was expected to start growing at some undefined future date when it did, Vincent would have to start chemotherapy just to keep it in check. By 2014, still   Vincent had grown moderately anxious, depressed, and wary, on continual high alert for signs that the cancer growth had finally begun. Ã¢ÂÂThe anvil over your head, the constant surveillance of your health  Ã¢ÂÂ   it takes a toll,Ã¢ÂÂ says Vincent, who owns an advertising agency in Victoria, British Columbia. She found herself thinking, Ã¢ÂÂWhatÃ¢ÂÂs the point of this? All IÃ¢ÂÂm doing is waiting for the lymphoma. There was no sense of being able to look forward to something.Ã¢ÂÂ When she wasnÃ¢ÂÂt worrying about her cancer, she was worrying about her son, then in his   and going through a difficult time. What would happen to him if she died? Participating in the psilocybin study, she says, was the first thing sheÃ¢ÂÂd looked forward to in years. The experiment involved two treatments with psilocybin, roughly one month apart  Ã¢ÂÂ   one at a dose high enough to bring on a markedly altered state of consciousness, the other at a very low dose to serve as a control. ItÃ¢ÂÂs difficult to design an experiment like this to compare treatment with an actual placebo, since itÃ¢ÂÂs obvious to everyone when a psychedelic experience is underway. The NYU study used a design similar to HopkinsÃ¢ÂÂ but with an Ã¢ÂÂactive placebo,Ã¢ÂÂ the B vitamin niacin, instead of    psilocybin as the control. Niacin speeds up heart rate but doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have any psychedelic effect. In both studies it was random whether a volunteer got the dose or the control first, but everyone got both, and the order seemed to make no difference in the outcome. Vincent had to travel from her home in Victoria to Baltimore for the sessions her travel costs were covered by the Heffter Research Institute, the New Mexico nonprofit that funded both studies. She spent the day before each treatment with the two Hopkins staffers who would be her Ã¢ÂÂguidesÃ¢ÂÂ during the psilocybin trip. They helped her anticipate some of the emotional issues  Ã¢ÂÂ   the kind of baggage everyone has  Ã¢ÂÂ   that might come to the fore during the experience. The guides told Vincent that she might encounter some hallucinations that were frightening, and that she shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt try to run away from them. Ã¢ÂÂIf you see scary stuff,Ã¢ÂÂ they told her, Ã¢ÂÂjust open up and walk right in.Ã¢ÂÂ They repeated that line the following day  Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂjust open up and walk right inÃ¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ   when Vincent returned to Hopkins at 9 a. m. having eaten a light breakfast. The treatment took place in a hospital room designed to feel as homey as possible. Ã¢ÂÂIt felt like your first apartment after college, circa 1970,Ã¢ÂÂ she says, with a beige couch, a couple of armchairs and some abstract art on the wall. Vincent was given the pill in a ceramic chalice, and in about 20 minutes she started to feel woozy. She lay down on the couch, put on some eye shades and headphones to block out exterior sights and sounds, and focused on what was happening inside her head. The headphones delivered a   playlist of Western classical music, from Bach and Beethoven to BarberÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂAdagio for Strings,Ã¢ÂÂ interspersed with some sitar music and Buddhist chants. Vincent recalled the music as mostly soothing or uplifting, though occasionally there were some brooding pieces in a minor key that led her images to a darker place. With the music as background, Vincent started to experience a sequence of vivid hallucinations that took her from the deep sea to vast outer space. Listening to her describe it is like listening to anyone describe a dream  Ã¢ÂÂ   itÃ¢ÂÂs a disjointed series of scenes, for which the intensity and meaning can be hard to convey. She remembered seeing neon geometric shapes, a gold shield spelling out the name Jesus, a whole series of cartoon characters  Ã¢ÂÂ   a fish, a rabbit, a horse, a pirate ship, a castle, a crab, a superhero in a cape  Ã¢ÂÂ   and at some point she entered a crystal cave encrusted with prisms. Ã¢ÂÂIt was crazy how overwhelmed by the beauty I was,Ã¢ÂÂ she says, sometimes to the point of weeping. Ã¢ÂÂEverything I was looking at was so spectacular.Ã¢ÂÂ At one point she heard herself laughing in her sonÃ¢ÂÂs voice, in her brotherÃ¢ÂÂs voice, and in the voices of other family members. The cartoon characters kept appearing in the midst of all that spectacular beauty, especially the Ã¢ÂÂcomical crabÃ¢ÂÂ that emerged two more times. She saw a frightening black vault, which she thought might contain something terrifying. But remembering her guidesÃ¢ÂÂ advice to Ã¢ÂÂjust open up and walk right in,Ã¢ÂÂ she investigated, and found that the only thing inside it was herself. When the experience was over, about six hours after it began, the guides sent Vincent back to the hotel with her son, who had accompanied her to Baltimore, and asked her to write down what sheÃ¢ÂÂd visualized and what she thought about it. Griffiths had at first been worried about giving psychedelics to cancer patients like Vincent, fearing they might actually become even more afraid of death by taking Ã¢ÂÂa look into the existential void.Ã¢ÂÂ But even though some research participants did have moments of panic in which they thought they were losing their minds or were about to die, he said the guides were always able to settle them down, and never had to resort to the antipsychotic drugs they had on hand for emergencies. (The NYU guides never had to use theirs, either.) Many subjects came away feeling uplifted, Griffiths says, talking about Ã¢ÂÂa sense of unity,Ã¢ÂÂ feeling part of Ã¢ÂÂan interconnected whole.Ã¢ÂÂ He adds that even people who are atheists, as Vincent is, described the feeling as precious, meaningful or even sacred. The reasons for the power and persistence of psilocybinÃ¢ÂÂs impact are still Ã¢ÂÂa big mystery,Ã¢ÂÂ according to Griffiths. Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs what makes this research, frankly, so exciting,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂs so much thatÃ¢ÂÂs unknown, and it holds the promise for really understanding the nature of human   and consciousness.Ã¢ÂÂ He says he looks forward to using psilocybin in other patient populations, not just people with terminal diagnoses, to help answer larger existential questions that are Ã¢ÂÂso critical to our experience as human organisms.Ã¢ÂÂ Two and a half years after the psychedelic experience, Carol Vincent is still   but sheÃ¢ÂÂs not as terrified of the Ã¢ÂÂanvilÃ¢ÂÂ hanging over her, no longer waiting in dread for the cancer to show itself. Ã¢ÂÂI didnÃ¢ÂÂt get answers to questions like, Ã¢ÂÂWhere are you, God?Ã¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂWhy did I get cancer?Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ she says. What she got instead, she says, was the realization that all the fears and worries that Ã¢ÂÂtake up so much of my mental real estateÃ¢ÂÂ turn out to be Ã¢ÂÂreally insignificantÃ¢ÂÂ in the context of the big picture of the universe. This insight was heightened by one small detail of her psilocybin trip, which has stayed with her all this time: that little cartoon crab that floated into her vision along with the other animated characters. Ã¢ÂÂI saw that crab three times,Ã¢ÂÂ Vincent says. The crab, she later realized, is the astrological sign of cancer  Ã¢ÂÂ   the disease that terrified her, and also the sign that both her son and her mother were born under. These were the three things in her life that she cared about, and worried over, most deeply, she says. Ã¢ÂÂAnd here they were, appearing as comic relief.Ã¢ÂÂ Science writer Robin Marantz Henig is a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine and the author of nine books.",cancer,How A Psychedelic Drug Helps Cancer Patients Overcome Anxiety,2252.0,2252.0,252.0,
2253,"Two widely used tests to analyze the genetics of tumors often donÃ¢ÂÂt come to the same conclusions, according to    analyses. Authors of two recent studies comparing these tests say doctors need to be careful not to assume that these tests are providing a complete picture of a tumorÃ¢ÂÂs genetic variants, when using them to select treatments for cancer patients. Dr. C. Anthony Ã¢ÂÂTonyÃ¢ÂÂ Blau and colleagues at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle compared results from two commonly used tests that are used to identify mutations in tumors. The FoundationOne test is used on tissue samples extracted from tumors. Guardant360 gathers traces of tumor DNA from blood samples. Blau started out with a small sample of just nine patients, as he reported Thursday in JAMA Oncology. One had no mutations at all recognized by either test. Of the remaining eight, the two tests provided remarkably different results. Only 22 percent of the time (in 10 out of 45 instances) did both tests identify the same mutation. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not to say the tests themselves are technically flawed, Blau told Shots. But each test has its limitations, and so the results vary. Tests of tumor tissue donÃ¢ÂÂt sample the entire tumor. And tumor cells arenÃ¢ÂÂt all the same, so a sample doesnÃ¢ÂÂt give a complete picture of tumor genetics. Blood tests sample   cells that break loose from tumors. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a useful technology if a tumor is hard to sample directly, but again it provides an incomplete snapshot of the cancerÃ¢ÂÂs genetic mutations. Ã¢ÂÂTheyÃ¢ÂÂre looking for a needle in a haystack,Ã¢ÂÂ Blau says. Blood samples drawn at different times can produce different results, because different cells may be in the blood. And tumors evolve over time, so some of the difference could reflect that as well. Ã¢ÂÂThe mutations you are looking for that might guide you to a particular drug can present in most or only a tiny fraction of cells,Ã¢ÂÂ Blau said. So either test can fail to detect a clinically important mutation. These blood tests often include a list of cancer drugs for doctors to consider, based on the mutations detected. The recommendations also varied, because the tests often found different mutations. Only 25 percent of the time (in 9 of 36 cases) did these two tests recommend the same drug among the eight patients in the study. These observations build on similar results of a somewhat larger study, published in August in the journal Oncotarget. In a sample of 28 patients, researchers found consistent results only about 17 percent of the time. Ã¢ÂÂIt all boils down to a question of tumor biology,Ã¢ÂÂ says lead author of that study, Young Kwang Chae, an oncologist and a   of the Developmental Therapeutics Program of the Division of Hematology and Oncology at Northwestern UniversityÃ¢ÂÂs Feinberg School of Medicine. Ã¢ÂÂYou can never say one test is the gold standard, or that one is better than the other,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Because they are looking at different samples, itÃ¢ÂÂs not surprising their results vary. Many of the results from these tests are hard to interpret in the first place. In many instances, the presence of a particular mutation doesnÃ¢ÂÂt tell a doctor exactly what form of therapy would work best. But Chae says when he finds an Ã¢ÂÂactionable genetic alterationÃ¢ÂÂ from either test, he uses that that to guide a patientÃ¢ÂÂs therapy. Ã¢ÂÂBoth tests are right,Ã¢ÂÂ argues Dr. Rick Lanman, chief medical officer at Guardant Health, which produces the   Guardant360 test. If either test detects a particular mutation, there is high confidence that the particular mutation exists. And doctors can confidently base therapy on that positive detection, he says. Doctors could get more complete results if they ran both tests on everybody, Ã¢ÂÂbut thatÃ¢ÂÂs not cost effective,Ã¢ÂÂ Lanman says. His counterpart at Foundation Medicine, which makes the FoundationOne test, isnÃ¢ÂÂt convinced that both tests are equally reliable. Dr. Vincent Miller says the blood tests can miss a lot more than tests run on tumor tissue. He points to a recent study of pancreatic cancer. Gene variants very frequently found in pancreatic cancer were detected in 87 percent of tumor samples. But blood tests only found the mutations about 25 percent of the time. Miller says his company has a blood test as well as the test for solid tumors, and theyÃ¢ÂÂre in the process of running a direct comparison, using the same genetic information. That could help clarify how much trust to put in blood tests, he says. Ã¢ÂÂThe technology may have gotten a little ahead of the clinical practice and the science,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Doctors may be lulled into thinking that these tests are providing definitive results, but theyÃ¢ÂÂre not. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs the overarching message for Blau at the University of Washington. Ã¢ÂÂYou really have to be thoughtful about how you apply these to clinical decision making,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Ã¢ÂÂIf you donÃ¢ÂÂt understand these limitations, if you just treat the reports at face value, that could be leading to instances where oncologists use drugs that are unlikely to be effective.Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,When Genetic Tests Disagree About Best Option For Cancer Treatment,2253.0,2253.0,253.0,

Ariad stock was up 73 percent at $23. 77 in morning trading on Monday. In 2016, its shares had nearly doubled. TakedaÃ¢ÂÂs   blood cancer drug Velcade is expected to face generic competition this year and other key products go off patent from 2020. Cancer drugs are appealing to large drugmakers, with high prices being paid for promising assets. San   Medivation was bought by Pfizer Inc ( ) for $14 billion in August.

In November, Reuters reported that TakedaÃ¢ÂÂs negotiations to acquire Valeant Pharmaceuticals International IncÃ¢ÂÂs ( ) Salix   business had stalled, citing sources.  With the Ariad deal, the Japanese drug giant gains access to the leukemia drug, Iclusig, which is expected to generate sales of $170  $180 million in 2016. Ariad came under fire in October for price increases of Iclusig. A U. S. Food and Drug Administration decision on its lung cancer treatment, brigatinib, which is being touted as a potential blockbuster, is expected by April. Sarissa Capital Management LP, a hedge fund run by investor Carl IcahnÃ¢ÂÂs former healthcare lieutenant, had announced a stake in Ariad in 2013.  Sarissa will tender its shares to Takeda, if the deal goes through. Ariad suspended Iclusig sales in 2013 after data showed it was associated with serious complications, but resumed marketing after the FDA sanctioned its use in a narrower patient population. The equity value of the deal, which is expected to add to TakedaÃ¢ÂÂs earnings in 2018, is $4. 66 billion, according to Reuters calculations.

Dayton said the episode had prompted him to disclose the prostate cancer earlier than planned. The governor was briefly hospitalized about a year ago after fainting while speaking at an event in the St. Paul suburb of Woodbury. Aides said then that he was treated for dehydration.

By insisting that the complex is safe despite the known presence of Ã¢ÂÂcarcinogenic substancesÃ¢ÂÂ such as formaldehyde and mercury, the Navy has left lawyers with the Ã¢ÂÂuntenableÃ¢ÂÂ choice between preserving their health and defending their clients, the complaint said. A Pentagon spokesman said the Defense Department does not discuss pending litigation. The complaint was filed in the federal court in Washington by Army Major Matthew Seeger, and civilian lawyers Cheryl Bormann, Edwin Perry and Michael Schwartz. All represent Walid Bin Attash, a Yemeni man and suspected al Qaeda training camp leader charged with helping plot the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New YorkÃ¢ÂÂs World Trade Center and the Pentagon outside Washington.  The lawyers are seeking an injunction requiring the Defense Department to provide accommodations that protect them from the Ã¢ÂÂknown and unknown risksÃ¢ÂÂ of living and working at Camp Justice. The complex is on the site of a former airfield, and includes temporary housing known as Cuzcos, essentially trailers, where lawyers live and work, the complaint said. Three of the nine cancer victims have died, including Navy Lieutenant Commander Bill Kuebler at age 44 in July 2015, the complaint added. Defense Department officials Ã¢ÂÂhave the responsibility to make sure the facilities where military and civilian personnel are working are safe, but are continuing to order them to work there despite the presence of known carcinogens,Ã¢ÂÂ Daniel Small, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an interview. While none of the plaintiffs has been diagnosed with cancer, Ã¢ÂÂthey have experienced lesser health symptoms,Ã¢ÂÂ he added.     Small said that his firm, Cohen Milstein Sellers and Toll, and Venable LLP, which also represents the plaintiffs, are not being paid for their work on the case. Only 41 people remain incarcerated at the Guantanamo prison on the U. S. naval base in Cuba, down from 242 when Barack Obama became president.

2258,"Lung cancer is by far the largest oncology market and the approval significantly expands the number of patients available for Keytruda therapy. Merck shares were up 3. 2 percent at $65. 99 in extended trading. Ã¢ÂÂThis is the key game changer for Keytruda,Ã¢ÂÂ said Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez, adding that he expects physician acceptance to be Ã¢ÂÂpretty robust.Ã¢ÂÂ The accelerated approval was based on data from a study of 123 previously untreated patients with metastatic     cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Ã¢ÂÂIt was a small trial but the results were really quite striking,Ã¢ÂÂ said Roy Baynes, head of global clinical development for Merck Research Labs. The Food and Drug Administration approved Keytruda in combination with Eli LillyÃ¢ÂÂs ( ) Alimta, the chemotherapy drug used in the study that led to the agencyÃ¢ÂÂs decision. Merck may be asked to conduct another trial to confirm the clinical benefit of the combination.

2259," David Bowie, the visionary British rock star who coupled hits such as Ã¢ÂÂSpace OddityÃ¢ÂÂ with   pop personas like Ã¢ÂÂZiggy Stardust,Ã¢ÂÂ has died at age 69, apparently of liver cancer, just two days after releasing what appears to be the parting gift of a new album. A pioneering chameleon of performance imagery, Bowie straddled the worlds of hedonistic rock, fashion, art and drama for five decades, pushing the boundaries of music and his own sanity to produce some of the most innovative songs of his generation. Ã¢ÂÂDavid Bowie died peacefully today surrounded by his family after a courageous   battle with cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ read a statement on BowieÃ¢ÂÂs Facebook page dated Jan. 10. BowieÃ¢ÂÂs son, film director Duncan Jones, confirmed the death. A spokesman for Bowie said he died on Sunday but declined to say where he died or from what type of cancer. Bowie had kept a low profile after having emergency heart surgery in 2004 and it was not publicly known that he had cancer. Belgian stage director Ivo van Hove, who directed the current   experimental play Ã¢ÂÂLazarus,Ã¢ÂÂ which Bowie   and for which he provided much of the music, said the singer had been diagnosed with liver cancer some 15 months ago. Ã¢ÂÂHe told me more than a year and three months ago just after he had heard himself . .. he said it was liver cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ van Hove told Dutch public radio broadcaster NOS in an interview on Monday. Ã¢ÂÂI saw a man who didnÃ¢ÂÂt want to die, he really didnÃ¢ÂÂt want to die. . .. He was in a battle for his life. Sometimes he looked at me and I saw a man who was suffering through and through because he knew the clock was ticking,Ã¢ÂÂ the director told Dutch TV in a separate interview. One of BowieÃ¢ÂÂs   public appearances was in New York in   to watch the show, which is due to close on Jan 19. In London, mourners laid flowers, lit candles and sang his greatest hits besides a mural to Bowie in the edgy Brixton district of south London where he was born Fans also gathered and laid flowers outside the apartment building in New YorkÃ¢ÂÂs trendy Soho district where he had a home. Bowie died two days after releasing Ã¢ÂÂBlackstarÃ¢ÂÂ which won some of the best critical reviews of his career. A music video for the first single, Ã¢ÂÂLazarus,Ã¢ÂÂ showed him lying in a hospital bed with bandages across his eyes, and singing lyrics that after his death, took on added poignancy. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve got scars that canÃ¢ÂÂt be seen. IÃ¢ÂÂve got drama, canÃ¢ÂÂt be stolen. Everybody knows me now. Look up here, man, IÃ¢ÂÂm in danger. IÃ¢ÂÂve got nothing left to lose,Ã¢ÂÂ Bowie sang. Ã¢ÂÂHe made Ã¢ÂÂBlackstarÃ¢ÂÂ for us, his parting gift. I knew for a year this was the way it would be. I wasnÃ¢ÂÂt, however, prepared for it,Ã¢ÂÂ BowieÃ¢ÂÂs record producer, Tony Visconti, wrote on his Facebook page on Monday. Sales and streaming of Ã¢ÂÂBlackstarÃ¢ÂÂ and BowieÃ¢ÂÂs older albums soared on Monday, rising to the top of AppleÃ¢ÂÂs iTunes charts in the United States and the UK. Streaming service Spotify said streams of BowieÃ¢ÂÂs music were up 2, 700 percent on Monday. Tributes poured in from titans of popular music, including the Rolling Stones, Madonna, rapper Kanye West and Paul McCartney. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm proud to think of the huge influence he has had on people all around the world. . .. His star will shine in the sky forever,Ã¢ÂÂ McCartney said. Ã¢ÂÂThe Rolling Stones are shocked and deeply saddened to hear of the death of our dear friend David Bowie,Ã¢ÂÂ the Stones said. Ã¢ÂÂHe was an extraordinary artist, and a true original.Ã¢ÂÂ Madonna said on Twitter: Ã¢ÂÂTalented. Unique. Genius. Game Changer. The Man who Fell to Earth. Your Spirit Lives on Forever!Ã¢ÂÂ  The Vatican said: Ã¢ÂÂCheck ignition and may GodÃ¢ÂÂs love be with youÃ¢ÂÂ   borrowing a verse from BowieÃ¢ÂÂs first hit, Ã¢ÂÂSpace Oddity.Ã¢ÂÂ Born David Jones in south London on Jan. 8, 1947, he took up the saxophone at 13 before changing his name to David Bowie to avoid confusion with the MonkeesÃ¢ÂÂ Davy Jones, according to Rolling Stone.  He shot to fame in Britain in 1969 with Ã¢ÂÂSpace Oddity,Ã¢ÂÂ whose words he said were inspired by watching Stanley KubrickÃ¢ÂÂs film Ã¢ÂÂ2001: A Space OdysseyÃ¢ÂÂ while stoned.  BowieÃ¢ÂÂs haunting lyrics summed up the loneliness of the Cold War space race between the United States and the Soviet Union and coincided with the Apollo spacecraft landing on the moon. Bowie married the   supermodel Iman in 1992 with whom he had a daughter, Alexandria Zahra Jones, born in 2000. Ã¢ÂÂZIGGY STARDUSTÃ¢ÂÂ It was BowieÃ¢ÂÂs 1972 portrayal of a doomed bisexual rock envoy from space, Ziggy Stardust, that propelled him to global stardom. Bowie and Ziggy, wearing outrageous costumes, makeup and bright orange hair, took the pop world by storm. He defined the theatrical glam rock movement with the albums Ã¢ÂÂHunky DoryÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThe Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from MarsÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂAladdin SaneÃ¢ÂÂ. Ã¢ÂÂZiggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly,Ã¢ÂÂ  Bowie sang with a red lightning bolt across his face and flamboyant jumpsuits. Ã¢ÂÂMaking love with his ego, Ziggy sucked up into his mind, like a leper messiah.Ã¢ÂÂ By now an influential symbol of artistic reinvention venturing into the theatre, film and fashion worlds, Bowie continued to innovate, helping produce Lou ReedÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂWalk on the Wild SideÃ¢ÂÂ and Iggy PopÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂLust for LifeÃ¢ÂÂ album. This was a period that saw Bowie sporting an array of fantastic costumes, some said to based on the chilling Kubrick movie Ã¢ÂÂA Clockwork OrangeÃ¢ÂÂ. Ã¢ÂÂThe trousers may change, but the actual words and subjects IÃ¢ÂÂve always chosen to write with are things to do with isolation, abandonment, fear and anxiety, all of the high points of oneÃ¢ÂÂs life,Ã¢ÂÂ Bowie said in a rare interview in 2002.  Ever ahead of public opinion, Bowie told the Melody Maker newspaper in 1972 that he was gay, a step that helped pioneer sexual openness in Britain, which had only decriminalised homosexuality in 1967. Bowie had married in 1970. Four years later, he informed Playboy that he was bisexual, but he told Rolling Stone magazine in the 1980s that the declaration was Ã¢ÂÂthe biggest mistake I ever madeÃ¢ÂÂ and that he was Ã¢ÂÂalways a closet heterosexual.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂLETÃ¢ÂÂS DANCEÃ¢ÂÂ Bowie went through another metamorphosis in the   adopting a soul and funk sound and abandoning stack heels for designer suits and flat shoes. He scored his first U. S. No. 1 with Ã¢ÂÂFameÃ¢ÂÂ and established a new persona, the Ã¢ÂÂThin White DukeÃ¢ÂÂ for his Ã¢ÂÂStation to StationÃ¢ÂÂ album. But the excesses of a hedonistic life were taking their toll. In a reference to his prodigious appetite for cocaine, he said: Ã¢ÂÂÃÂI blew my nose one day in California. ÃÂAnd half my brains came out. Something had to be done.Ã¢ÂÂ Bowie moved from the United States to Switzerland and then to Cold   Berlin to recuperate, working with Brian Eno from Roxy Music to produce some of his least commercial and most ambitious music, including Ã¢ÂÂÃÂLowÃ¢ÂÂ and ÃÂÃ¢ÂÂHeroesÃ¢ÂÂ in 1977. He scored a big hit with funk dance track Ã¢ÂÂFashionÃ¢ÂÂ in 1980. In 1983, Bowie changed tack again, signing a     deal with EMI. The first, ÃÂÃ¢ÂÂLetÃ¢ÂÂs DanceÃ¢ÂÂ returned him to chart success and almost paid off his advance. He starred on Broadway in Ã¢ÂÂThe Elephant ManÃ¢ÂÂ at the start of the decade and appeared in an array of films including Ã¢ÂÂMerry Christmas, Ã¢ÂÂThe HungerÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂAbsolute BeginnersÃ¢ÂÂ and as Pontius Pilate in Martin ScorseseÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂThe Last Temptation of ChristÃ¢ÂÂ.

2260," U. S. Vice President Joe Biden said on Tuesday that the United States would speed up the approval of promising new drug combinations in his governmentÃ¢ÂÂs newly announced drive to cure cancer Ã¢ÂÂonce and for allÃ¢ÂÂ. Biden, who lost his    son Beau to brain cancer last year, set out his plans at a World Economic Forum meeting of international cancer experts in Davos, a week after being appointed to lead the initiative by President Barack Obama.   combination therapy is increasingly seen as central to fighting tumours, as scientists unlock the different genetic factors driving cancer cell growth, but bringing such cocktails to market can be a slow and costly.  Biden said he had hosted a meeting at his home with three unnamed large drug companies and the head of the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at which both sides had pledged to do more to get novel cancer drug cocktails to patients. Ã¢ÂÂThe head of the FDA made a commitment that everybody would move much more rapidly in approving combinations,Ã¢ÂÂ Biden said. At the same, the pharmaceutical industry executives had all said they were Ã¢ÂÂopen to different way of doing businessÃ¢ÂÂ in order to ensure that promising drugs from different companies were tested together as early as possible, he added. Cancer experts are particularly excited by the promise of new immunotherapy medicines that help the bodyÃ¢ÂÂs immune system fight tumours and which have been shown to work well when used alongside other drugs. Francis Collins, director of the U. S. National Institutes of Health, described their potential as Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ. But such immunotherapy drugs are expensive   typically costing well over $100, 000 a year per patient   and companies have traditionally been defensive about sharing   medical experiments. ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs call to Ã¢ÂÂmake America the country that cures cancer once and for allÃ¢ÂÂ in the last State of the Union address of his presidency has led to criticism from some scientists of an   approach to the killer condition. The latest   initiative has echoes of former President Richard NixonÃ¢ÂÂs unsuccessful Ã¢ÂÂWar on CancerÃ¢ÂÂ in the 1970s, since when scientists have discovered that cancer is hundreds of different diseases rather than one single disorder, making the notion of a single cure outdated. Biden acknowledged the complexity in Davos. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm not naive enough to think or suggest we are going to have a cure for every cancer in the world in the near term,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.

2261," Chemical maker DuPont ( ) will face 40 trials a year starting April 2017 involving plaintiffs who say they developed cancer from a toxic chemical used to make Teflon that leaked from one of the companyÃ¢ÂÂs plants in West Virginia.  The schedule laid out by U. S. District Judge Edmund Sargus in the Southern District of Ohio during a hearing Wednesday is aimed at pushing the parties closer to resolving more than 3, 550 lawsuits.  The outcome could have a material impact on Chemours Co ( ) since liability for litigation connected with the chemical   was passed on to the firm   by DuPont in 2015.  The cases have been filed by individuals who say they developed one of six diseases linked to perfluorooctanoic acid, also known as PFOA or   which was found in their drinking water. Their cases are consolidated before Sargus.  The initial 40 trials will be selected from between 250 and 300 lawsuits brought by individuals who say they contracted kidney or testicular cancer from  .  Ã¢ÂÂPeople shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt have to wait ten years for a trial,Ã¢ÂÂ Sargus said, according to a transcript of the hearing. DuPont spokesman Dan Turner said the company was pleased plaintiffs would go to trial individually, rather than as a group, as plaintiffsÃ¢ÂÂ lawyers had proposed. In the past, DuPont said Ã¢ÂÂmega trialsÃ¢ÂÂ would confuse jurors and be unfair to it. A lead plaintiffsÃ¢ÂÂ lawyer, Michael London, called SargusÃ¢ÂÂ plan Ã¢ÂÂa good start.Ã¢ÂÂ The lawsuits center on claims DuPont used   at a West Virginia plant for decades despite knowing it was toxic and had been found in nearby drinking water.  While the cancer claims are moving forward to trial, DuPont has said in court filings that 90 percent of the litigation involves less deadly conditions such as high cholesterol and thyroid disease.  To help estimate the aggregate value of individual suits in mass litigation, it is common to hold a series of bellwether, or test trials. The first   bellwether ended in October with a $1. 6 million verdict for a plaintiff who had kidney cancer. Four other trials are scheduled for 2016.  While DuPont was the named defendant, Chemours said it would cover DuPontÃ¢ÂÂs liability for the first verdict. Chemours agreed to take on some of DuPontÃ¢ÂÂs legal liabilities when it was spun off from the company to house its performance chemicals segment. Chemours has said an unfavorable outcome from the lawsuits could have a Ã¢ÂÂmaterial adverse effectÃ¢ÂÂ on its finances. Chemours stock was little changed Thursday at $3. 12 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has fallen 80 percent since it was spun off.

More from Reuters *  *  *  Johnson & Johnson faces claims that it, in an effort to boost sales, failed for decades to warn consumers that its   products could cause cancer. About 1, 000 cases have been filed in Missouri state court, and another 200 in New Jersey. Fox, who lived in Birmingham, Alabama, claimed she used Baby Powder and Shower to Shower for feminine hygiene for more than 35 years before being diagnosed three years ago with ovarian cancer. She died in October at age 62. Jurors found Johnson & Johnson liable for fraud, negligence and conspiracy, the familyÃ¢ÂÂs lawyers said. Deliberations lasted four hours, following a   trial. Jere Beasley, a lawyer for FoxÃ¢ÂÂs family, said Johnson & Johnson Ã¢ÂÂknew as far back as the 1980s of the risk,Ã¢ÂÂ and yet resorted to Ã¢ÂÂlying to the public, lying to the regulatory agencies.Ã¢ÂÂ He spoke on a conference call with journalists.

2263,"Researchers focused on 20 expensive medicines that are given by injection or intravenous drip and require doses adjusted based on the patientÃ¢ÂÂs body size. Often, the packages contain much more medicine than patients need, and the leftovers wind up in the trash.  Even when much of the medicine goes in the garbage, patients pay for the whole vial, said lead author Dr. Peter Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.  Ã¢ÂÂThe waste is driving up the cost of their care and it is money that they are spending that provides them no benefit,Ã¢ÂÂ Bach said by email. Ã¢ÂÂIt also drives up the cost for their insurance, which leads to higher premiums, which costs them more money too. Ã¢ÂÂ  Patients and insurers pay drug manufacturers about $1. 8 billion a year for medicines that are thrown away, Bach and colleagues report in The BMJ.  They also pay an additional $1 billion to doctors and hospitals on wasted medications, according to the analysis.  Waste isnÃ¢ÂÂt inevitable, the researchers conclude.  Take bendamustine, a drug for leukemia, that is sold in a broad array of package sizes. Doctors can combine different sized vials to get so close to the precise amount needed by the patient that only about 1 percent of the drug is wasted, the analysis finds.  But with another drug, bortezomib for multiple myeloma, the only available package size is far larger than what a typical patient needs and up to 30 percent of sales are due to wasted medicine, the analysis finds.  The drugs in the study treat a wide variety of tumors including breast, colon, prostate and pancreatic malignancies. They are all whatÃ¢ÂÂs known as biologic medicines, which are engineered from living cells, and they are generally far more expensive than pills. Biologic medicines often lack preservatives and have a higher risk of contamination than other drugs, and leftovers from   vials are thrown out because using them could give patients infections, said Stacie Dusetzina, a pharmacy researcher at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill who wasnÃ¢ÂÂt involved in the study.  Ã¢ÂÂOne of the clearest solutions to this waste is to have more dosing options available,Ã¢ÂÂ Dusetzina said by email. That would require drug makers to sell the medicines in a variety of package sizes.  More packaging options might also help with drug shortages, Dr. Yoram Unguru, an oncology researcher at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore who wasnÃ¢ÂÂt involved in the study, said by email.  While drug packages might in theory be used for more than one patient, in reality this would require scheduling people who need the same medicine to come in to receive chemotherapy at the same time, said Dwight Kloth, director of pharmacy at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. Ã¢ÂÂThis is very difficult to do, and anything but convenient for patients,Ã¢ÂÂ Kloth, who wasnÃ¢ÂÂt involved in the study, said by email.  Beyond scheduling, concerns about safe handling and storage of opened vials to avoid contamination generally stop this type of sharing from happening, said Dr. Nancy Keating of Brigham and WomenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.  Ã¢ÂÂGiven concerns about causing harm, most healthcare entities (if not all) consider that use of   vials should be for a single patient,Ã¢ÂÂ Keating, who wasnÃ¢ÂÂt involved in the study, said by email. Ã¢ÂÂThus, any leftover drug gets discarded. Ã¢ÂÂ SOURCE:   The BMJ, online March 1, 2016.

2264," A new wave of experimental cancer drugs that directly recruit the immune systemÃ¢ÂÂs powerful T cells could begin reaching patients next year, according to companies presenting new data at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. In interviews with Reuters, Kite Pharma Inc ( ) and Juno Therapeutics Inc ( ) both said they could receive initial regulatory approvals next year for a type of immunotherapy treatment known as chimeric antigen receptor   ( ) therapies.   therapies involve a complicated process of extracting immune system T cells from an individual patient, altering their DNA to sharpen their ability to spot and kill cancer cells, and infusing them back into the same patient. The technique is being tested against a range of different cancer types, but first in blood cancers. Kite aims to file this year for U. S. Food and Drug Administration approval of its therapy,   for patients with diffuse large   lymphoma (DLBCL) according to Chief Medical Officer David Chang. Juno Chief Executive Officer Hans Bishop said adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are now being enrolled in a   trial of the companyÃ¢ÂÂs most advanced product, JCAR015, that Ã¢ÂÂwe believe will support accelerated approval.Ã¢ÂÂ He said JCAR015 Ã¢ÂÂcould be approved as soon as 2017.Ã¢ÂÂ Data presented on Saturday showed that 77 percent of patients with advanced ALL achieved a Ã¢ÂÂcomplete response,Ã¢ÂÂ meaning cancer remission, when treated with chemotherapy followed by JunoÃ¢ÂÂs cell therapy. For the trial patients with minimal disease, 90 percent achieved remission, researchers said.    percent of patients in the JCAR15 trial experienced a severe inflammatory response to the altered cells, and 15 percent had serious nervous system side effects. Bishop said Juno has developed an assay to determine which patients are likely to experience risky side effects, but said the company has not yet disclosed the details. A separate National Institutes of Health   study involving KiteÃ¢ÂÂs   drug and   chemotherapy included 19 patients with various subtypes of DLBCL. Of those, eight patients achieved remission, five had partial responses, two had stable disease, and four had their cancer get worse. Two trial  patients with advanced follicular lymphoma also obtained remissions. Ã¢ÂÂIn the near future,   cells will likely be a standard therapy for lymphoma,Ã¢ÂÂ said lead study author James Kochenderfer, an investigator at the National Cancer Institute. Some patients treated with the   therapies have remained cancer free, but the jury is out on whether that will continue, or whether they will need new treatment. Ã¢ÂÂSome of these responses are amazing in patients who would never have responded to anything,Ã¢ÂÂ said ASCO President Dr Julie Vose. Ã¢ÂÂThe question is, is it practical?

2265," There is no conclusive evidence that drinking coffee causes cancer, the World Health OrganizationÃ¢ÂÂs cancer agency said on Wednesday in a reverse of its previous warning, but it also said all Ã¢ÂÂvery hotÃ¢ÂÂ drinks are probably carcinogenic. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) had previously rated coffee as Ã¢ÂÂpossibly carcinogenicÃ¢ÂÂ but has changed its mind.  It now says its latest review found Ã¢ÂÂno conclusive evidence for a carcinogenic effectÃ¢ÂÂ of coffee drinking and pointed to some studies showing coffee may actually reduce the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Ã¢ÂÂ(This) does not show that coffee is certainly safe . .. but there is less reason for concern today than there was before,Ã¢ÂÂ Dana Loomis, the deputy head of IARCÃ¢ÂÂs Monograph classification department told a news conference. At the same time, however, IARC presented other scientific evidence which suggests that drinking anything very hot   around 65 degrees Celsius or above   including water, coffee, tea and other beverages, probably does cause cancer of the oesophagus.    IARC, which last year prompted headlines worldwide by saying processed meat can cause cancer, reached its conclusions after reviewing more than 1, 000 scientific studies in humans and animals. There was inadequate evidence for coffee to be classified as either carcinogenic or not carcinogenic. IARC had previously put coffee as a Ã¢ÂÂpossible carcinogenÃ¢ÂÂ in its 2B category alongside chloroform, lead and many other substances.  The U. S. National Coffee Association welcomed the change in IARCÃ¢ÂÂs classification as Ã¢ÂÂgreat news for coffee drinkersÃ¢ÂÂ. The Institute for Scientific Information on Coffee, whose members are six of the major European coffee companies   illycaffÃÂ¨, Jacobs Douwe Egberts, Lavazza, NestlÃÂ© ( ) Paulig, and Tchibo   said IARC had found Ã¢ÂÂno negative relationship between coffee consumption and cancerÃ¢ÂÂ. LET IT COOL In its evaluation of very hot drinks, IARC said animal studies suggest carcinogenic effects probably occur with drinking temperatures of 65 Celsius or above. Some experiments with rats and mice found Ã¢ÂÂvery hotÃ¢ÂÂ liquids, including water, could promote the development of tumours, it said. The agency said studies of hot drinks such as matÃÂ©, an infusion consumed mainly in South America, tea and other drinks in several countries including China, Iran, Japan and Turkey, found the risk of oesophageal cancer Ã¢ÂÂmay increase with the temperature of the drinkÃ¢ÂÂ above 65 Celsius.  Ã¢ÂÂThese results suggest that drinking very hot beverages is one probable cause of oesophageal cancer and that it is the temperature, rather than the drinks themselves, that appears to be responsible,Ã¢ÂÂ said IARCÃ¢ÂÂs director, Christopher Wild.  Oesophageal cancer is the eighth most common cause of cancer worldwide and one of the main causes of cancer death, with around 400, 000 deaths recorded in 2012. The WHOÃ¢ÂÂs official spokesman in Geneva, Gregory Hartl, stressed that smoking and drinking alcohol were among the most serious risk factors for oesophageal cancer and urged people to focus on reducing these as a priority. He said IARCÃ¢ÂÂs evaluation of hot drinks was based on limited available evidence in humans and animals and more research is needed. Ã¢ÂÂWe say: be prudent, let hot drinks cool down,Ã¢ÂÂ he told Reuters, adding that the WHOÃ¢ÂÂs advice was to Ã¢ÂÂnot consume foods or drinks when they are at a very hot   scalding hot   temperatureÃ¢ÂÂ.  Drinking very hot beverages is now classified as probably carcinogenic in IARCÃ¢ÂÂs group 2A category, alongside red meat and nitrogen mustard.  But David Spiegelhalter, a professor of the Public Understanding of Risk at BritainÃ¢ÂÂs University of Cambridge, said he was concerned that IARCÃ¢ÂÂs review would confuse people. Ã¢ÂÂLast year the IARC said that bacon is carcinogenic, but it became clear that when eaten in moderation it is not very risky.  In the case of very hot drinks, the IARC concludes they are probably hazardous, but canÃ¢ÂÂt say how big the risk might be,Ã¢ÂÂ he said in an emailed comment. Ã¢ÂÂThis may be interesting science, but makes it difficult to construct a sensible response.Ã¢ÂÂ  (Reporting by Kate Kelland; Editing by Pravin Char) (Reuters Health)   White and black children in the United States did not benefit equally from a recent reduction in infant mortality, according to new research.

2266,"Medivation shares jumped nearly 20 percent to close at $80. 42, just shy of the offer price of $81. 50 per share. Shares of Pfizer, the largest U. S. drugmaker, were down 0. 4 percent at $34. 84.  The offer is a   premium to Sanofi SAÃ¢ÂÂs ( ) initial bid to buy Medivation for $52. 50 per share in April, which pushed the San   company to put itself up for sale. It represents a   increase since Reuters reported on March 30 that Medivation had hired JP Morgan to handle interest from companies in a potential acquisition.    The planned purchase of Medivation, with its $2. 2    Xtandi, is the latest in a number of deals by large drugmakers willing to pay top dollar for cancer drugs that are more effective than standard, older treatments. Perhaps the most notable example is AbbVie IncÃ¢ÂÂs ( ) $21 billion purchase last year of Pharmacyclics. The deal gave AbbVie shared ownership with Johnson & Johnson ( ) in the blockbuster leukemia drug Imbruvica. Analysts predicted the deal would not raise antitrust concerns because Pfizer does not currently sell a prostate cancer drug aside from generics.   Pfizer said its earnings would increase immediately after buying Medivation. The deal comes four months after Pfizer and   Allergan Plc ( ) scrapped their $160 billion merger. Pfizer has since bought Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc in a $5. 2 billion deal to add an eczema gel to its portfolio. The Medivation deal illustrates a shift in PfizerÃ¢ÂÂs M&A strategy from lowering taxes   the rationale behind the failed Allergan tax inversion deal   to strengthening its lineup of branded drugs, especially lucrative cancer treatments. Pfizer, in a conference call with analysts, said it still plans to decide by   whether to split into separate companies selling either   generics or   brand medicines.  Ã¢ÂÂThe Medivation deal increases the likelihood of a split,Ã¢ÂÂ said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris. But, he said, Pfizer would likely first try to buy other drugmakers or their best assets in order to further strengthen its   portfolio. A year ago, Pfizer paid $15 billion for Hospira, which sells generic hospital products and is developing biosimilars meant to compete with   injectable biotech drugs. That deal was seen by Wall Street as a way of bolstering its generic drugs ahead of potentially divesting the business.  PfizerÃ¢ÂÂs biggest growth driver is a new breast cancer drug called Ibrance. The company is also trying to catch up with Merck & Co ( ) and   Squibb Co ( ) in developing   drugs that work by taking the brakes off the immune system to fight cancers. Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read told analysts the Medivation deal was mainly driven by the desire to obtain Xtandi, although he expressed high hopes for talazoparib and pidilizumab, experimental Medivation drugs for breast cancer and lymphoma, respectively. Xtandi generated U. S. net sales of $330. 3 million in the second quarter. Japanese drugmaker Astellas Pharma Inc ( ) owns the rights to sell Xtandi outside the United States, where it generated sales of $240 million in the period. Read said Xtandi, which was approved four years ago to treat men who had failed to benefit from prostate cancer treatments, could capture far greater sales if it is eventually approved for earlier use and is prescribed by urologists. Ã¢ÂÂThe product is just at the beginning of its growth cycle,Ã¢ÂÂ Read predicted.  Some analysts, including BMOÃ¢ÂÂs Alex Arfaei, said Pfizer appeared to be overpaying for Medivation. But Piper Jaffray analyst Richard Purkiss said the price is not excessive given XtandiÃ¢ÂÂs potential for earlier treatment in coming years. Reuters had reported that Pfizer, Merck, Celgene Corp ( ) and Gilead Sciences Inc ( ) had submitted expressions of interest to buy Medivation.   Ã¢ÂÂGiven the already very high price being discussed, the difficult public relationship between Medivation and Sanofi . ..  we see a higher bid as very unlikely, but not impossible,Ã¢ÂÂ RBC Capital Partners wrote in a client note ahead of the announcement.      Sanofi said while it recognized the potential strategic benefits of a combination with Medivation, it was a Ã¢ÂÂdisciplined acquirer and remained committed to acting in the best interests of Sanofi shareholders.Ã¢ÂÂ  Pfizer said the deal was approved by boards of both companies and should be completed in the third or fourth quarter. Shares of other cancer drug companies, including Incyte Corp ( ) and Seattle Genetics ( ) also rose on Monday, as investors speculated about  more dealmaking in the sector.  PfizerÃ¢ÂÂs financial advisers were Guggenheim Securities and Centerview Partners, with Ropes & Gray LLP providing legal counsel.  J. P.

2267," When her fatherÃ¢ÂÂs lung cancer worsened, Yin Min, a    financial broker from Shanghai, faced a choice: pay nearly $3, 000 a month for an approved drug or pay a fraction of the price for a generic drug not approved for use in China. Yin, like many families in China, turned to the increasingly popular, unregulated market of online pharmacies, agents and peer groups for drugs.  She bought a generic version of Iressa, not approved for use in China, directly from a manufacturer in India. Ã¢ÂÂWith this sort of misfortune, itÃ¢ÂÂs hard to put into words the financial pressure you feel,Ã¢ÂÂ Yin told Reuters. Of 30 cancer patients interviewed by Reuters over the past year, two thirds took routes similar to YinÃ¢ÂÂs, pushed by ChinaÃ¢ÂÂs high drug prices and a lack of access to newer drugs. The patients were aged between 32 and 81, had varying income levels and suffered from a variety of cancers. There is no official data on how many cancer patients in China turn to unregulated channels, but research indicates an increase globally in the use of gray and counterfeit markets. Liu Xuemei, a    carcinoma patient from Beijing, said she went through a pharmacy agent to get a cheaper alternative to the approved Zadaxin, while Zhao Xiaohua, who has lung cancer, said he found a cheaper treatment through a patients group recommended by his doctor. Patients Reuters spoke to said doctors often turn a blind eye to them accessing drugs through the gray market, and some actively help them do this. Medicines bought through unofficial channels are not necessarily harmful, and some of the Indian generics available online are approved for use in other markets. But they can include drugs that are ineffective or fake.  The reason patients in China turn to these unregulated channels are largely financial.  Low average salaries, a chasm between urban and rural wealth, and creaking state reimbursement schemes mean serious disease is among the leading causes of poverty, creating a major social burden and rising debt. In YinÃ¢ÂÂs case, the generic drug she bought was 13 times less expensive than the   branded Tarceva. But Chinese also turn to unofficial channels because of bottlenecks in ChinaÃ¢ÂÂs drug approvals, which pharmaceutical executives say can mean drugs lag markets like the United States by   years. China requires all new drugs to be tested and approved in the country, but has a shortage of specialists for this work. The national drug reimbursement list, the main catalog of medicines covered by state health insurance, is being updated for the first time since 2009. That means even if a drug has been approved, patients can often only access it if they pay for it themselves.  ChinaÃ¢ÂÂs health ministry did not respond to ReutersÃ¢ÂÂ questions about patients turning to unregulated channels to buy medicines, or the lack of access to new drugs. The high cost of drugs is not confined to China, and there has been a jump globally in   Ã¢ÂÂbuyers clubsÃ¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ   informal patient groups sourcing drugs via the grey market to help those with HIV and hepatitis access drugs at more affordable prices. LIMITED OPTIONS China last year had four million new cancer cases, according to official data, and the nationÃ¢ÂÂs personal healthcare bill is set to soar almost fourfold to 12. 7 trillion yuan ($1. 84 trillion) by 2025, according to Boston Consulting Group. For many Chinese, being left outside the health system at a time of need is in sharp contrast to the Ã¢ÂÂiron rice bowlÃ¢ÂÂ concept of state benefits and guarantees for life. Ã¢ÂÂIf we canÃ¢ÂÂt buy the drug in China or we canÃ¢ÂÂt afford to buy it, then what other options do we have?Ã¢ÂÂ asked Duan Guangping, a banker in Chongqing, whose mother got lung cancer in 2011. He bought a drug for her from Bangladesh. China has sought to increase insurance coverage for serious diseases, and encourage drug makers to lower their prices to gain better market access. It has also tried to speed up the regulatory approval process by thinning out the waiting list, forcing manufacturers to withdraw new drugs where trial data isnÃ¢ÂÂt strong enough.  But change has been slow. Ã¢ÂÂA lot of new oncology drugs were approved in the U. S. and UK, but in China thereÃ¢ÂÂs a   year delay,Ã¢ÂÂ said Li Tiantian, a former doctor and founder of medical platform DXY. com. Ã¢ÂÂA lot of patients with cancer cannot wait.Ã¢ÂÂ The overall   survival rate for cancer in China is just over 30 percent, less than half the level in the United States, according to Deutsche Bank.     LEGAL RISK Turning to unofficial channels can also carry a legal risk. Leukemia patient Lu Yong, a prominent member of a local Ã¢ÂÂbuyers clubÃ¢ÂÂ was arrested last year and charged with selling unapproved drugs and credit card fraud. He was later released after a public outcry. In 2004, after buying a generic version of Iressa from India, Lu helped set up an online group for leukemia patients, who wanted the same drugs he was getting at a fraction of the price of the approved drug in China. The generic started at around 3, 000 yuan ($435) and the price slowly dropped over the years, Lu said   to a long way below the price of the approved drug from AstraZeneca. Ã¢ÂÂThere was no other option, so we took this path even though what we were doing was against the law,Ã¢ÂÂ Lu told Reuters before his arrest.  Lu declined to comment to Reuters after his release, but in his earlier interview he said he never profited from the transactions and only helped other patients to make the complicated overseas payments.    Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs because of problems with ChinaÃ¢ÂÂs public health insurance system that so many seriously ill patients arenÃ¢ÂÂt able to survive,Ã¢ÂÂ he said then.

2268," Replication has emerged as a powerful tool to check science and get us closer to the truth. Researchers take an experiment thatÃ¢ÂÂs already been done, and test whether its conclusions hold up by reproducing it. The general principle is that if the results repeat, then the original results were correct and reliable. If they donÃ¢ÂÂt, then the first study must be flawed, or its findings false.      But thereÃ¢ÂÂs a big wrinkle with replication studies: They donÃ¢ÂÂt work like that. As researchers reproduce more experiments, theyÃ¢ÂÂre learning that they canÃ¢ÂÂt always get clear answers about the reliability of the original results. Replication, it seems, is a whole lot murkier than we thought.  Take the latest findings from the   Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology. Here, researchers focused on reproducing experiments from the   papers about cancer biology published from 2010 to 2012. They shared their results in five papers in the journal ELife last week  Ã¢ÂÂ   and not one of their replications definitively confirmed the original results.  The findings echoed those of another landmark reproducibility project, which, like the cancer biology project, came from the Center for Open Science. This time, the researchers replicated major psychology studies  Ã¢ÂÂ   and only 36 percent of them confirmed the original conclusions.    Replicating studies, it turns out, is really, really hard. For them to get easier, scientists are going to have to learn to be much more transparent about their process. WeÃ¢ÂÂre also going to need to start looking at replication studies with the same critical gaze we reserve for single studies of any kind.    Replicating studies is really, really hard Replicating a study doesnÃ¢ÂÂt just mean reading the paper and trying to run it again. ItÃ¢ÂÂs more like trying to play a complicated board game without all the instructions or even all the parts.  To pull off the replication studies in cancer biology, the researchers had to go back to the authors of the original papers and ask them to share any information they may have left out of their methods sections and any additional unpublished data that helped them arrive at their conclusions.     They then came up with a plan for reproducing the study, and got that plan peer reviewed  Ã¢ÂÂ   including by the original authors, statisticians, and experts in the relevant field.  Ã¢ÂÂSometimes weÃ¢ÂÂd learn we were doing the wrong experiment, and weÃ¢ÂÂd go back and make the changes,Ã¢ÂÂ said Tim Errington, who led the cancer reproducibility project. Once the changes were accepted, the real work would begin: running the experiment.  After they wrote up the results, they passed them through peer review and the original author was invited to weigh in again. (Not every author wanted to participate, of course, which sometimes made the process even harder.)    Sometimes, things as small as the temperature of the lab could cause a cell biology experiment to flop, Errington said. Other researchers whoÃ¢ÂÂve replicated psychology studies said they had to overcome language and cultural barriers in translating the original science to a new lab. The takeaway here is that replication can go off the rails very easily if researchers donÃ¢ÂÂt take the utmost care  Ã¢ÂÂ   and even when they do.  If a replication fails, it may be a bad replication  Ã¢ÂÂ   not necessarily a bad original study Interpreting the results of a replication study is another place where things can get messy, fast. And increasingly scientists are realizing that if a replication fails to reproduce the original results, it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean the original was wrong.  With the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology, not one of the replications definitively confirmed the original results: Two of the papers reproduced parts of the original experiments, one failed to reproduce the original experiment entirely, and the other two replications were impossible to interpret because of technical problems with the models. Ã¢ÂÂIt could be that the original was false positive,Ã¢ÂÂ Errington said. Ã¢ÂÂIt could be that the replication is a false negative, that the replication did something wrong, or probably that they are both right  Ã¢ÂÂ   the original is right, and the replication is right  Ã¢ÂÂ   and whatÃ¢ÂÂs occurring is that we donÃ¢ÂÂt know the cause of the discrepancy. Ã¢ÂÂ  In other words, there are any number of reasons a replication may fail, and they may say nothing about the quality of the original research.  Ã¢ÂÂA single failure to replicate is no more definitive than a single study claiming discovery,Ã¢ÂÂ Bristol researcher Marcus MunafÃÂ², who recently   a manifesto for reproducible science, told me. Ã¢ÂÂGiven the latter, we need to do more of the former and not just assume that a single study claiming discovery is robust. Ã¢ÂÂ     Doing replication studies properly is costly and time consuming, said Lawrence Tabak, the principal deputy director at the National Institutes of Health. Which Ã¢ÂÂmeans you canÃ¢ÂÂt do wholesale replications  Ã¢ÂÂ   but there is likely a subset of studies we really should consider doing replication. Ã¢ÂÂ  For example, researchers should try to replicate their findings from animal studies before moving to costlier human studies. Ã¢ÂÂ[LetÃ¢ÂÂs say a] replication study of an animal study would cost half a million dollars,Ã¢ÂÂ Tabak said. Ã¢ÂÂOne could argue thatÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of money  Ã¢ÂÂ   why spend it? The answer is you would want to do be certain the key experimental results could be replicated before spending $5 million on a first in human study. Ã¢ÂÂ  The neurology and aging centers at the NIH already do this, he added, and the NIH recently released guidelines on reproducing research. Scientists and journals need to get better at describing their methods and sharing data Whenever IÃ¢ÂÂve talked to researchers who have done replication studies, it becomes clear pretty quickly that their endeavor wonÃ¢ÂÂt go so well if they donÃ¢ÂÂt have   from the researchers who did the original study. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs because the methods sections of research papers  Ã¢ÂÂ   which describe how an experiment was done  Ã¢ÂÂ   often arenÃ¢ÂÂt very detailed.  Ã¢ÂÂOne of the biggest barriers to reproducibility is simply knowing how the original research was done,Ã¢ÂÂ said Brian Nosek, who   the Center for Open Science, which supported the cancer biology and psychology reproducibility projects.  A greater degree of transparency and data sharing would make replications easier  Ã¢ÂÂ   and more reliable. So researchers need to get better at describing their methods in detail and sharing their data.     Ã¢ÂÂThere may be some results that can be reproduced all the time very easily, others that get reproduced under very specific conditions, and others that are not reproduced at all. The emerging picture is that the two last categories may be very common,Ã¢ÂÂ Stanford   John Ioannidis said in an email. Ã¢ÂÂFunding agencies should clearly pay attention to this,Ã¢ÂÂ he added, instead of wasting money on research that isnÃ¢ÂÂt reproducible.  Researchers could also make use of tools, like   software that tracks every version of a data set, so that they can share their data more easily and have transparency built into their workflow. As we wrote in a feature on the biggest problems in science at Vox, journals and funders also needs to rethink their incentive structures to reward more transparency and replications. Ã¢ÂÂ[Replication projects are] shining a light on the way we conduct research,Ã¢ÂÂ Errington said. For better or worse, the way studies are done now makes the work of replicating them very hard and the results of replications more dubious. But, he added, Ã¢ÂÂIf we make ourselves more open and transparent from the beginning, before our work is even published in a paper, thatÃ¢ÂÂll probably help a lot.

SheÃ¢ÂÂs far from keen on Donald TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs presidency but has a certain respect for Ivanka TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs class and ambition. SheÃ¢ÂÂs 21 years old, and she has cancer, and even that, suddenly, is not her only concern, due to an order signed by the new president.    ItÃ¢ÂÂs leukemia sheÃ¢ÂÂs battling at St. Jude Hospital in Memphis. ItÃ¢ÂÂs the second time in two years that her cancer has come back. Last year she was in treatment at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. SheÃ¢ÂÂs dreaming of living in New York, of going back to college. One year ago she was enrolled at university in Virginia, studying pharmacy, and plotting her future cosmetics line  Ã¢ÂÂ   specialized for cancer patients with skin weakened by chemotherapy treatments. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm someone who wants to complete my education and do something for the world,Ã¢ÂÂ she told me.

And Yaghoubi is an Iranian national who came to the United States in 2015 alone and healthy for university, and has since had to try to change her student visa to a medical visa. She is unsure of what her status is now. She is unsure of what it will be when she goes into remission.     Ã¢ÂÂWhen you are going through treatment for something so serious, the last thing you want to think about is your status,Ã¢ÂÂ Yaghoubi said. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs heartbreaking.

Her mother, who is staying with Yaghoubi in Memphis, is uncertain whether returning to visit her son in Iran or to check in on her job as an accountant would leave her daughter indefinitely alone.

2270," In his final State of the Union address one year ago, President Obama announced a Ã¢ÂÂmoonshotÃ¢ÂÂ initiative to Ã¢ÂÂcure cancer once and for all. Ã¢ÂÂ    Though the moonshot will be one of ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs few health programs to continue under President Donald Trump  Ã¢ÂÂ   its $1. 8 billion budget is secure  Ã¢ÂÂ   today, on World Cancer Day, it remains more difficult than ever to imagine a real cure.  Take the    man diagnosed with prostate cancer in my clinic at Brigham and WomenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital in Boston. He received a novel procedure to remove his prostate, and later received focused radiation to try to eradicate any remaining cancer. Unfortunately, his disease returned a year later. But after two new therapies, his cancer now appears in check. And if his cancer does spread, a host of other treatments  Ã¢ÂÂ   including many not even on the market yet  Ã¢ÂÂ   may put his cancer back in remission.  As with most cancers after treatment, my patientÃ¢ÂÂs disease is under control, but not cured. And it likely will never be.    The problem with the Ã¢ÂÂmoonshotÃ¢ÂÂ idea is that it focuses on magic bullets, at the expense of the majority of current and future cancer patients. To eliminate the global burden of cancer, patients and doctors need an equal focus on prevention as on cure  Ã¢ÂÂ   or we need to redefine the word Ã¢ÂÂcureÃ¢ÂÂ altogether. With increased funding for prevention research and wider dissemination of prevention initiatives, we could be even closer to eradicating cancer entirely.    The biggest lesson from the war on cancer is that we are incredibly far from a cure Why do we think that we can cure cancer? In his book The Death of Cancer, former National Cancer Institute director Vincent DeVita writes that the United StatesÃ¢ÂÂ war on cancer came about in the 1970s due to an assortment of advocates and politicians. Their mission was articulated best by the National Panel of Consultants on the Conquest of Cancer, whose report in 1970 called for Ã¢ÂÂthe conquest of cancer. Ã¢ÂÂ  At the time, the concept of Ã¢ÂÂcureÃ¢ÂÂ was eradication of cancers after they were diagnosed  Ã¢ÂÂ   to treat cancer with chemotherapy just as we treat infectious diseases with antibiotics. And so millions of dollars went toward funding research that studied and created novel therapies for cancer. And the idea of a Ã¢ÂÂwar on cancerÃ¢ÂÂ has persisted, with the Ã¢ÂÂmoonshotÃ¢ÂÂ its most ambitious attack yet.    The war on cancer has succeeded in creating more treatments, and oncologists have moved from extremely toxic chemotherapies to targeted molecular therapies, such as the drug imatinib for chronic myelogenous leukemia, which control cancer in many more individuals. Now cancer therapy has been revolutionized by Ã¢ÂÂimmunotherapiesÃ¢ÂÂ that ramp up the bodyÃ¢ÂÂs own immune system to fight cancer. But perhaps the biggest lesson from the war on cancer is that we are incredibly far from a cure. Cancer is not one disease but thousands, each with its own causes and genetic markers.  Take non Ã¢ÂÂ  small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) the most common cause of cancer death in the US. According to National Cancer Institute data, more than half of people with lung cancer are diagnosed after cancer has spread beyond the lung; more than 80 percent of these patients die within a year. Research on molecular targets has suggested that there are more than 15 different Ã¢ÂÂdriverÃ¢ÂÂ mutations in NSCLC, and most tumors possess a multitude of these mutations.     Just as it is difficult to defeat an army of enemies by picking off individual soldiers one at a time, even one targeted therapy in metastatic NSCLC is unlikely to eradicate the entire disease. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the case with most cancers and may explain why 63 percent of oncologists would never tell a patient that they are cured after treatment. Even newer immunotherapies at best delay the progression of cancer, but cannot cure it. It remains difficult, if not impossible, to cure cancers  Ã¢ÂÂ   if we define cure as treatment. New treatments open up an entirely new vision of preventative Ã¢ÂÂcuresÃ¢ÂÂ Prevention may instead provide the solution we have long been seeking. The 23 percent reduction in the US cancer mortality rate over the past two decades  Ã¢ÂÂ   1. 7 million cancer deaths prevented  Ã¢ÂÂ   is due in large part to cancer prevention interventions. These include   screening efforts in mammography and colonoscopy as well as increased vaccination efforts.  We can also find new innovations in prevention, some which may even eliminate incurable cancers. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer death in the world, and a major cause of morbidity globally. The hepatitis C virus is the major cause of HCC: Infected individuals have a   increased risk of developing HCC compared with   individuals.  Until recently, hepatitis C was incurable, and treatment to control the disease was associated with significant side effects. But in 2013, the drug sofosbuvir (trade name Sovaldi) was approved and offered many patients the opportunity to permanently eliminate hepatitis C  Ã¢ÂÂ   and prevent the possibility of subsequent HCC. Sofosbuvir, among other treatments, opens up an entirely new vision of Ã¢ÂÂcureÃ¢ÂÂ in cancer, more proactive than our previous conceptions. The need for prevention is dire: Tobacco control, good nutrition, vaccinations, and physical activity could prevent almost half of all cancers. Unfortunately, rates of hepatitis and human papillomavirus vaccination have remained below 60 percent for a decade. By focusing our efforts on the upstream determinants of cancer, we can achieve the elimination of cancer that has eluded us for the past 50 years. Unfortunately, there are no active moonshot grants funding prevention or early detection efforts. And the Blue Ribbon Panel Report, which describes the 10 research priorities for the moonshot, barely mentions prevention or early cancer detection. If this trend continues, funding for cancer prevention and control will be crowded out within the shrinking pie of federal research dollars.    Our cancer moonshot is a worthwhile goal  Ã¢ÂÂ   and will continue into Donald TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs presidency. More investment in eliminating cancer will accelerate progress. And developing new therapies is part of that strategy.  But we must acknowledge that a treatment that permanently eliminates cancer will likely never be found. Investing in creating and disseminating prevention strategies will save countless more lives than newer cancer treatments. This is the best chance of permanently eliminating cancer, nailing the cure that we all want. Ravi Parikh is a resident in internal medicine at Brigham and WomenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital in Boston.

2271," Julienne Edwards was 26, five days away from taking the California bar exam and 14 months away from her wedding, when she felt a twinge in her stomach. The throbbing grew sharper, like a knife puncturing her gut, so Edwards went to the hospital to get help.     It was the beginning of a nightmare. Edwards, who was otherwise healthy, was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer. Within four days of her hospital visit, she was on an operating table for emergency surgery to remove a tumor blocking her lower intestines and part of her colon. The surgeons also discovered the cancer had spread to her ovaries, so they removed them too. She left the hospital that day unable to have children with her own eggs.  Instead of starting her family and moving to LA for the dream job she had lined up at an agency that represents film composers, she found herself writing her will. She and her fiancÃÂ©   their wedding date by a year, aware that their time together might be cut short.  Ã¢ÂÂCancer has a way of putting your priorities through the spin cycle,Ã¢ÂÂ Edwards said from her home in Baltimore, where sheÃ¢ÂÂs living to be close to family and her doctors at Johns Hopkins.    The way cancer interrupted EdwardsÃ¢ÂÂs plans is more the rule than the exception. A diagnosis often means a complete life upheaval and, in America, stratospheric health care costs, compounded by employment pauses or even job losses.    The Affordable Care Act provided some   inoculation from the financial stress and hardship. Many provisions in the   law seemed to be designed for cancer patients like Edwards. She was able to stay on her parentsÃ¢ÂÂ insurance plan at first and then purchase affordable coverage on the individual marketplace, which covered the cost of her treatment.  But many of these provisions are now on the chopping block under Republican health reform plans. The 1. 6 million people who will be diagnosed with cancer in America this year, as well as the additional 15. 5 million who have a history of the disease, are in particular jeopardy: TheyÃ¢ÂÂre uncertain whether theyÃ¢ÂÂll be able to get insurance or afford their medical bills if the law is dismantled.     Cancer is hugely expensive to treat. Obamacare provided some protection for patients against those costs. Cancer bills have been a leading cause of personal bankruptcy in the US, and a third of survivors report ongoing   financial problems  Ã¢ÂÂ   a common reason many skipped health care they may have needed. According to a 2013 study in the American Journal of Clinical Oncology, from 2008 to 2010 the annual economic burden of the illness among recently diagnosed cancer survivors was more than $16, 000 per person.  The research also suggests that up to 85 percent of cancer patients stop working while getting treatment, with absences that range from 45 days to six months. Edwards experienced that disruption. She couldnÃ¢ÂÂt go to California to take the job sheÃ¢ÂÂd been offered because of her surgery, and the demands of her treatment delayed her bar exam, and left her unable to work full time.     Since her diagnosis two years ago, sheÃ¢ÂÂs gone through one course of chemotherapy, and has cobbled together   work, even managing to pass the Maryland bar in July. But in November, she learned that the cancer had come back.             Now sheÃ¢ÂÂs waiting to find out what her next treatment options will be, with a lot of time to think about the future. And her mind often wanders to worrying about one thing: the cost of her medical care.  For now, a number of Obamacare provisions have protected her from additional financial hardship.  Because Edwards was 26 when she learned she had cancer, her surgery and initial treatments were covered under the Affordable Care ActÃ¢ÂÂs dependent coverage provision, which allows young people to stay on their parentsÃ¢ÂÂ insurance plans until theyÃ¢ÂÂre 26. (Trump has said he favors this rule, and Republican replacement plans do too.)   After she aged off her parentsÃ¢ÂÂ plan last January, she was able to take advantage of the law again to buy an insurance plan at $450 per month from the ACA marketplace. This is because of another Obamacare provision called guaranteed issue, which says people with preexisting conditions like cancer canÃ¢ÂÂt be denied coverage.  The law required insurance companies to remove lifetime caps on spending, which means that people like Edwards can get the treatments they need throughout their lives without hitting a cost ceiling. Her chemotherapy was considered an Ã¢ÂÂessential health benefitÃ¢ÂÂ under the law, so she doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have copays for it.     The ACA also prevented insurance companies from charging different premiums based on a history of cancer (theyÃ¢ÂÂre now set based on age ranges) so that helped make EdwardsÃ¢ÂÂs insurance more affordable. Obamacare isnÃ¢ÂÂt perfect: Edwards still has hefty $350 copays every time she needs a CT scan, and some of her pharmaceuticals arenÃ¢ÂÂt covered.  But prior to the ACA, cancer patients were virtually uninsurable if they had to buy plans on the individual market.  Ã¢ÂÂMillions of cancer patients found themselves unable to purchase insurance because of their preexisting condition,Ã¢ÂÂ said J. Leonard Lichtenfeld, the deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, in a recent testimony at the House of Representatives. Ã¢ÂÂEven those who were able to obtain coverage often found that annual or lifetime limits severely curtailed their coverage, leaving them vulnerable to enormous costs. Ã¢ÂÂ Some patients had their insurance policies revoked after being diagnosed.  Had the ACA not been signed into law, Edwards might be uninsured and saddled with $200, 000 in medical debt from 2015 alone, on top of the student debt sheÃ¢ÂÂs still carrying from law school. SheÃ¢ÂÂd also have to pay $48, 000 for every course of chemotherapy. In other words, the cancer would not only challenge her health; it would cripple her financially.  How the Republican plans to dismantle Obamacare could make life tougher for cancer patients It has long been a truism of American health care that a small group of patients cost the most money. The top 1 percent of health care spenders account for nearly a quarter of overall health care spending, and the top 20 percent are responsible for 82 percent of the total.     It is this 20 percent that are the most challenging group for any insurance coverage expansion, because they have bills that are well beyond the financial reach of most people  Ã¢ÂÂ   and the government needs to decide how much money it wants to provide as a safety net for them.            The ACA tried to address this group by essentially putting the young, old, sick, and healthy into the same risk pool through the individual mandate, which requires everybody to purchase coverage. In a country without universal health care, the law also mandated that insurance companies no longer discriminate against people who have fallen ill or who are living with a chronic disease (as cancer often is) and it made health insurance and some of the most costly cancer treatments accessible and affordable.  Republican health reform plans aim to strip away the individual mandate. They also have weaker protections for people with preexisting conditions, and would not require insurers to offer as generous benefit packages as the ACA  Ã¢ÂÂ   something that could hit patients with costly treatments and medications especially hard.  House Speaker Paul RyanÃ¢ÂÂs plan would maintain the ACAÃ¢ÂÂs ban on lifetime caps  Ã¢ÂÂ   but Health and Human Services Secretary Tom PriceÃ¢ÂÂs plan would eliminate the provision. Under PriceÃ¢ÂÂs proposal, cancer patients would once again be subject to paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for their medical bills after hitting a spending limit.  If the Republicans go with PriceÃ¢ÂÂs plan, this will have life and death implications for cancer patients. Ã¢ÂÂMy worry is if [the Republicans] remove the lifetime caps again, I might be able to afford chemotherapy rounds one, two, and three,Ã¢ÂÂ Edwards said, Ã¢ÂÂbut when they get around to making that immunotherapy [that could eventually cure the cancer] I might not be able to afford it or the insurance wonÃ¢ÂÂt cover it. Ã¢ÂÂ The trouble with Ã¢ÂÂcontinuous coverageÃ¢ÂÂ and   pools for cancer patients Republicans (including Ryan, Price, and Senate Finance Chair Orrin Hatch) have also championed an idea called continuous coverage to get around the health lawÃ¢ÂÂs individual mandate. In sum, it would require insurance companies to not discriminate against patients based on their health status  Ã¢ÂÂ   so long as those patients have managed to maintain health insurance continuously, without a lapse.     The idea sounds okay in theory: If everybody maintains coverage all the time, the insurance pool is viable because you have sick people and healthy people in the system.  The reality is that many people with chronic diseases such as cancer may not be able to meet that requirement. Like Edwards, theyÃ¢ÂÂve had to leave their jobs, or they have interruptions in their employment during cancer treatments. Breaks in employment could mean breaks in insurance, and according to the Republican health reform plans, those gaps could allow insurers to deny people coverage or charge them more  Ã¢ÂÂ   which is why groups such as the American Cancer Society oppose continuous coverage.  For those who fall through the cracks, both Price and Ryan favor reestablishing   pools, state insurance programs for people with serious illnesses who canÃ¢ÂÂt get coverage on the marketplace. Obamacare killed   pools, which were in place in 35 states plus Washington, DC, since the law banned denying people insurance based on a preexisting condition. And they were no panacea for patients. Some state   pools had long waiting lists that left people dying while they waited to get covered. They charged premiums that were up to 250 percent higher. And most charged high deductibles and denied people coverage for a preexisting condition for up to a year after enrollment.   pools also had coverage limits like annual and lifetime caps. In many cases, they essentially punished the people they were designed to help. Ã¢ÂÂ[The return of   pools] is a walk into the twilight zone for people who are in need of coverage who fall into this gap,Ã¢ÂÂ said John McDonough, a Harvard professor and Obamacare expert. Ã¢ÂÂA lot of people with cancer are going through one of the toughest experiences in their lives, and if Republicans get their way, itÃ¢ÂÂll get a lot tougher. Ã¢ÂÂ Avik Roy, an ACA thinker and president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity think tank, pointed out that weÃ¢ÂÂll have to wait on the precise language in a new Republican bill to see how   pools are structured, and whether theyÃ¢ÂÂll be different from the old ones. He also noted that premiums have gone up under Obamacare, and Republicans could implement reforms that make health insurance even more affordable for cancer patients. Ã¢ÂÂWe just donÃ¢ÂÂt know yet,Ã¢ÂÂ he added.     Right now the fate of the Affordable Care Act is very much an open question. The law has never been more popular. And it seems repealing the ACA and taking health insurance away from people is shaping up to be a much trickier proposition politically than Republicans bargained for.  Cancer patients like Edwards are waiting anxiously on the RepublicansÃ¢ÂÂ next moves. She has been carefully tracking the news and legislation on health reform and thinking about her plan B. If the law is dismantled and she loses her coverage, sheÃ¢ÂÂll try to raise funds to pay for her medical bills.  Ã¢ÂÂMy entire family would start a Kickstarter before they let me go without treatment,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. Ã¢ÂÂBut itÃ¢ÂÂs very strange that we are a society that lauds cancer survivors for their bravery and is more than happy to share in a Kickstarter for somebodyÃ¢ÂÂs medical careÃ¢ÂÂ but wonÃ¢ÂÂt support health insurance for all. Ã¢ÂÂI canÃ¢ÂÂt square it in my head. Ã¢ÂÂ  ",cancer,Cancer can bankrupt its victims. Obamacare was designed to stop that.,2271.0,2271.0,271.0,
2272," IÃ¢ÂÂve been thinking frequently this month about Henrietta, my paternal grandmother. I try to imagine what it felt like to be an American Jew in the   with news coming in about what happened to oneÃ¢ÂÂs counterparts in Europe. Henrietta and all but one of my grandparents were born in the United States. But in 1945, at the age of 36, my fatherÃ¢ÂÂs mother died anyway: of breast cancer. And one by one, her sisters all died of the same disease.    I wonder about that as well. What  Ã¢ÂÂ   if any  Ã¢ÂÂ   treatment did they receive? What killed them: the cancer and its progression? Or the treatment? The times, which brought death sentences to so many people like them?  HenriettaÃ¢ÂÂs daughter  Ã¢ÂÂ   my aunt  Ã¢ÂÂ   and HenriettaÃ¢ÂÂs sisterÃ¢ÂÂs daughters all lived well into old age. Most of them lived Ã¢ÂÂ . Ã¢ÂÂ One of them, my fatherÃ¢ÂÂs cousin Jeanine, did get breast cancer. So did my mother. Her diagnosis came in 2009, just after my   died. It hit me and my sisters particularly hard, increasing our sense of the risk of cancer now from both sides of the family. Mom heard the news within days of my return home to Brooklyn after sitting shiva with her in Chicago.  But thanks to advances in science, treatments for breast cancer have improved a great deal. The research of Eugene DeSombre, a biochemist, became part of the reason I did not lose my own mother, as my father had 64 years earlier. And itÃ¢ÂÂs part of the reason I urge you to march for science this Saturday, as well as study science, donate to science, and educate everyone you know about it.    DeSombre and his colleagues investigated the connections between the hormone estrogen and breast cancer. Their discovery of the mechanism by which estrogen promotes the growth of some tumors helped lead to one of the treatments that have kept my mother and my cousin Jeanine, as well as many, many other women who had cancer, from dying of it and from contracting it again.    I grew up into an awareness not just that I would never know my biological paternal grandmother, but that her death and her absence ever since caused my father a great deal of harm, not to mention counseling fees. An astute psychologist would note its ongoing impact on me, my sisters, our cousins, and even our children. Perhaps itÃ¢ÂÂs obvious that like many people with breasts, I also grew up with an everyday conscious as well as unconscious fear of breast cancer.  But as my 20s gave way to my 30s and then, in my 40s, as menopause approached, some of that fear eased. I noted that Henrietta and her sisters had daughters who were living into their 70s and that breast cancer had not emerged in my generation. I did not know how old my grandmother was when she died, but assumed from the young age of her children at the time, that she had likely not reached her 40s. Yet all of her granddaughters did.    And this granddaughter found a way to dedicate myself to improving the pipeline to schools and professions promoting the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Science has come a long way As I approached the end of my 40s, that decade Henrietta never reached, working with the help of many friends old and new, I founded the nonprofit I had dreamed up years beforehand. Math4Science Inc. is devoted to improving math education in service of science for students of all ages and backgrounds.  We are building a math curriculum out of interviews with STEM professionals: scientists, computer technologists, engineers, and mathematicians. Knowing about the work these people do and solving math problems connected to that work inspires and prepares students to enter STEM fields. Just as the scientists who discovered ways to help women survive breast cancer were once students, the elementary, middle, and high school math students of today will make the advances in science, tech, and engineering that we so desperately need.     Building Math4Science led me to interview Gene DeSombre, the biochemist of whose work I had been nearly completely ignorant while growing up with his daughter in ChicagoÃ¢ÂÂs Hyde Park, home of the University of Chicago. When I spoke with him, I did not realize that my mother had taken medication developed out of his research findings. I also interviewed Andrew Vickers, a biostatistician whose son went to school with my daughter in Brooklyn. Vickers researches cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, or MSKCC, both its causes and its treatment. Most surgeons donÃ¢ÂÂt have time to track their patientsÃ¢ÂÂ progress after surgery and may not have the math skills to analyze the patterns in that progress constructively. Vickers and his colleagues do that for them, determining which surgeries and other treatments have the most beneficial results. Doctors at MSKCC use the conclusions that VickersÃ¢ÂÂs biostatistics team draws to improve cancer treatments and their patientsÃ¢ÂÂ lives. Then the diagnosis came I turned 50 last summer. Around eight months later, I felt a lump in my breast. One doctorÃ¢ÂÂs visit, a barrage of mammogram images, a sonogram, and a biopsy later, all but the first at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, I turned out to be the first of my generation in my family to be diagnosed with breast cancer.  I could write at length about the past few weeks: about living to face one of my greatest,   fears; about the power of the care of friends and family; about the dizzying   connection and the havoc it wreaks; about how slowly time passes as one awaits surgery.  The lump awaiting removal makes me feel closer to the grandmother I never met, feeling her anguish and my fatherÃ¢ÂÂs at a life cut short. The two of us had an imaginary laugh this morning, though, as I recalled the way my grandfather used to shout for his second wife from their cigar   den. The Henrietta in my head raised an eyebrow: Not every moment she missed out on was as sweet as the kids, grandchildren, and   she would never know.    My own children are at the threshold of adulthood, but that does not exempt them from needing a mom. And I desperately want to spend time with my own grandchildren one day. Thank goodness science has progressed.  The cancer my mother had eight years ago was similar to the one I have now. Like hers, mine is  : blocking estrogen from my system should help cure me. As I mentioned, Mom is   now and able to spend time with her grandchildren, nearly all of whom she just hosted at her annual Passover Seder. Thank you, biochemist Eugene DeSombre and all of your colleagues past, present, and future. My own lump will be removed as part of an outpatient surgery at MSKCC on Tuesday. The    Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve got this and frankly itÃ¢ÂÂs quite routineÃ¢ÂÂ attitude of the surgeon who will do the lumpectomy, as well as the kindness of the entire staff at the hospital, has helped me plow through fields of fear sown by my family history.  The survival rate of those diagnosed with breast cancer has increased so much since my grandmotherÃ¢ÂÂs diagnosis. In the past 60 years, the rate of survival for 10 years after treatment at the MD Anderson Cancer Center has tripled. Thank you, biostatistician Andrew Vickers and all of your colleagues past, present, and future. And if my daughter or my future grandchildren or perhaps you, your friends, your children, or your grandchildren find lumps in their breasts that prove to be cancer, even better science, technology, engineering, and math may save their lives. Perhaps they will then go on to become scientists like DeSombre, Vickers, or Derek West. Right now, bioengineer Derek West and his colleagues are testing the power of gold. Nanoparticles of that precious metal can burn away cancer cells. They can also deliver   of chemotherapy to those cells. In other words, thanks to the work of Derek West and other scientists, technologists, and engineers, we may soon have treatments that target and kill cancer cells and leave the rest of our cells alone.    The dozens of interviews I have conducted for Math4Science introduced me to the research of West, Vickers, and DeSombre years before I discovered just how relevant that work would be to me and my family. They also provide the basis of the curriculum that will help us teach young math students the power of what theyÃ¢ÂÂre learning in school and its connections to the careers of so many essential people.  I have spoken with women and men whose work brings us water, protects us from hurricanes and other natural and less natural disasters, improves public transportation, manipulates genetic material to cure diseases like HuntingtonÃ¢ÂÂs, investigates the damage done to our immune systems when we play football or experience even psychological childhood trauma, makes sure the products we buy work and are safe, and much more.  And I have spoken to the men and women whose research has impacted multiple generations of women in my family who are battling breast cancer and who have helped increase the survival rate for breast cancer significantly. For your health and mine and for the health of generations to come, please protect, promote, and fund science. March for science Saturday and every day. And encourage children everywhere to study math and science and to become part of this fascinating, sometimes frustrating, powerful phenomenon. ItÃ¢ÂÂs likely to save my life, starting with surgery next Tuesday and with other treatments in the weeks, months, and years ahead.

2273," When Susan Thornton was 30, she noticed a flat red rash in a small band around her waist. It was itchy and terribly persistent. No cream or lotion made it go away.    One year and half a dozen dermatologists later, she was diagnosed with mycosis fungoides, a rare form of   lymphoma thatÃ¢ÂÂs often mistaken for eczema or psoriasis in its early stages.   years later, ThorntonÃ¢ÂÂs cancer is still around. It persists mostly as a manageable rash, treated with a topical steroid. At certain points the disease has flared up, requiring more drastic treatments. By 1998, the cancer had progressed to tumors, with scaly, itchy splotches spreading all over her body. It took a series of electron beam radiation treatments to knock it back, she says, Ã¢ÂÂmelting the tumors away.Ã¢ÂÂ ThorntonÃ¢ÂÂs cancer has been under control since her last radiation treatment five years ago. Still, itÃ¢ÂÂs never completely gone, never cured  Ã¢ÂÂ   instead, itÃ¢ÂÂs just something she lives with.    Most days, the Philadelphia native feels great. She participates in triathlons every year and travels the world for work as the CEO of the Cutaneous Lymphoma Foundation. Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt know why, but IÃ¢ÂÂm one of the lucky ones,Ã¢ÂÂ she says.    This sounds like a remarkable   story. But itÃ¢ÂÂs actually an increasingly common cancer experience. The cancer death rate has dropped by 23 percent since 1991, with some even larger gains in types of cancer that used to be extremely lethal. This means there are more and more patients like Thornton who are neither dying from cancer nor defeating it entirely. Instead, theyÃ¢ÂÂre learning to live with it.             Trends in cancer incidence and death rates by sex, United States, 1975 to 2012. () The way we think about cancer is outdated Many people have a simple narrative in mind when they think about cancer. Doctors discover a lump and treat it with surgery or radiation. Then one of two outcomes follows: complete remission or death.    But this couldnÃ¢ÂÂt be further from the reality of many cancer patients. Increasingly, researchers are learning that cancer can be many, many things. Under the   lymphoma umbrella alone, there are 60 different subtypes  Ã¢ÂÂ   and each has a different disease progression. To match these different diseases, there are now dozens of treatments and surgical interventions that are used in hundreds of combinations depending on the patient, cancer stage, and type.    Ã¢ÂÂTo imagine that we will find a simple solution to this doesnÃ¢ÂÂt do service to the true complexity of the problemÃ¢ÂÂ Most of these treatments do not Ã¢ÂÂcureÃ¢ÂÂ the disease  Ã¢ÂÂ   instead, they Ã¢ÂÂcontrolÃ¢ÂÂ it, turning it into something akin to a chronic condition, like diabetes. The conversation around cancer, however, hasnÃ¢ÂÂt caught up with this reality. Politicians are constantly promising to push for a cure, as Vice President Joe Biden did recently with his Ã¢ÂÂmoonshotÃ¢ÂÂ initiative. But many scientists now think cancer is too complex  Ã¢ÂÂ   itÃ¢ÂÂs not just one thing  Ã¢ÂÂ   for there to ever be a single silver bullet. Ã¢ÂÂTo imagine that we will find a simple solution to this doesnÃ¢ÂÂt do service to the true complexity of the problem,Ã¢ÂÂ explains Siddhartha Mukherjee, author of the cancer history The Emperor of All Maladies. If weÃ¢ÂÂre not going to cure cancer, weÃ¢ÂÂve got to learn to live with the disease. And this means radically changing how we talk and think about cancer. How we talk about cancer informs how people feel about the disease   When Whitney Archer was 25, she was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. Ã¢ÂÂI walked into this expecting I would lose my hair, my life,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. Ã¢ÂÂBut I have been able to keep all that.Ã¢ÂÂ    A brain tumor sounds terrifying. And it was for Archer, at first. But like lymphoma, there are numerous types of brain cancers. Archer was diagnosed with an astrocytoma: a tumor that grows in the astrocytes, or the supportive tissue, of the brain. Depending on the particular subtype of astrocytoma, the cancer can progress slowly or be very aggressive. Archer had a surgery to remove the tumor but has had no other therapies since, and no side effects from the condition. Ã¢ÂÂMy life is mostly like everyone elseÃ¢ÂÂs,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. The war metaphors people use havenÃ¢ÂÂt squared with ArcherÃ¢ÂÂs cancer experience. Ã¢ÂÂNot everything is a battle or fight,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. Ã¢ÂÂSometimes living is all you want.Ã¢ÂÂ Instead, she prefers the metaphor of living in two worlds. Every four months, when she goes for an MRI to make sure the cancer hasnÃ¢ÂÂt grown or changed in any way, she finds herself back in Ã¢ÂÂCancerland.Ã¢ÂÂ In that world, her vision of the future is a little more limited. She confronts her own mortality. Otherwise, itÃ¢ÂÂs just life as sheÃ¢ÂÂs always known it in Gainesville, Virginia, where she works as a writer and school librarian.  Ã¢ÂÂI told my son, Ã¢ÂÂI have this thing in my head. ItÃ¢ÂÂs called a tumor, a growth, but itÃ¢ÂÂs not growing. IÃ¢ÂÂm not sick. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ     Explaining this to her son wasnÃ¢ÂÂt easy at first: Ã¢ÂÂI just told him, Ã¢ÂÂI have this thing in my head. ItÃ¢ÂÂs called a tumor, a growth, but itÃ¢ÂÂs not growing. IÃ¢ÂÂm not sick. Look at me; you can see IÃ¢ÂÂm fine. I still go to work, like you go to school. We do normal things. Yes, itÃ¢ÂÂs cancer, but as far as we know, itÃ¢ÂÂs a kind thatÃ¢ÂÂs mostly okay.Ã¢ÂÂ With him, everything is so simple.Ã¢ÂÂ Her    seemed to grasp that concept more readily than a doctor she went to see for heartburn. The doctor wanted to order an endoscopy. Ã¢ÂÂThen she saw my medical history and said that if I have cancer, I had to do the procedure at a hospital,Ã¢ÂÂ Archer says. She had to explain that the two things were completely unrelated, that she wasnÃ¢ÂÂt on treatment and her cancer was under control. Overall, Archer points out, the language around cancer in general desperately lags behind the current scientific understanding of the disease  Ã¢ÂÂ   and that has implications for cancer patients and their families. She has to be careful about how she talks about her condition. Ã¢ÂÂSometimes I donÃ¢ÂÂt use the   because itÃ¢ÂÂs more shocking,Ã¢ÂÂ she says. Whenever she mentions her illness to friends for the first time, it means shock, an inevitable interruption in the conversation, and lots of explaining that sheÃ¢ÂÂs actually okay before they can keep talking about something else. This is why some cancer patients decide to keep their diseases a secret for as long as they can, says Laurence Klotz, a researcher at Sunnybrook in Toronto who works with prostate cancer patients. Ã¢ÂÂOne of the major challenges is to get patients off the incredible anxiety that goes along with cancer. ItÃ¢ÂÂs described in medical dictionaries as a lethal, rampaging disease,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. For most patients, however, prostate cancer is very slow to progress. Men who are diagnosed with the disease are generally more likely to die from something else. So Klotz always tries to urge his newly diagnosed patients that they should not consider the diagnosis an emergency. The Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ can initiate a panicky urgency in them. He opts for a different vocabulary. Ã¢ÂÂI describe this as a disease that develops with age,Ã¢ÂÂ he says, Ã¢ÂÂand I use phrases like Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂpart of the aging process,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂnot a real disease. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ    Ã¢ÂÂThere are many organs where this occurs  Ã¢ÂÂ   thyroid, breast, prostate, lung cancers,Ã¢ÂÂ Klotz continues. Ã¢ÂÂThese can develop and sometimes disappear.Ã¢ÂÂ Using a different language helps patients view these cancers for what they are: an almost inevitable mutation of cells that comes with getting older. Living with cancer can mean coping with cancer distress  Long after any physical changes that cancer brings are managed, emotional distress can linger, and it often comes in fits and bursts. One of the cancer counselors I spoke to, Matt Stevenson at the Abramson Cancer Center, has come up with a term to describe what many patients experience every time they go in for a scan or checkup: Ã¢ÂÂ .Ã¢ÂÂ The psychological effects of cancer are in fact so widespread that the American College of Surgeons recently required all accredited cancer centers to screen for the level of cancer distress in new patients and then offer psychosocial care to match patientsÃ¢ÂÂ needs. Ã¢ÂÂDistress can mean anxiety, depression, and anything else that causes stress,Ã¢ÂÂ explains Shawna Ehlers, a   at the Mayo Clinic. Ã¢ÂÂThe cancer community in general is getting much better at recognizing these psychological impacts.Ã¢ÂÂ In part, thatÃ¢ÂÂs because the psychology of cancer can have direct effects on patientsÃ¢ÂÂ treatments and health outcomes. Fear of progression or recurrence is the most common psychological impact cancer patients struggle with, and itÃ¢ÂÂs associated with both   and overuse of health care, Ehlers explains. Ã¢ÂÂAnxiety can cause us to be recurrently checking and calling the doctor and requesting testing and evaluation. But on the flip side, anxiety can be associated with avoidant coping, when people donÃ¢ÂÂt want to go to the doctor,Ã¢ÂÂ she says.    Depression is also associated with medical   meaning, for example, a patient may skip a chemotherapy treatment or forget to take her medications. In patients with chronic cancer, these effects can persist long after the diagnosis, long after families have dealt with the initial cancer shock. Ã¢ÂÂThe thing I wish everybody understood is that cancer can impact everything  Ã¢ÂÂ   depression, anxiety, fatigue,Ã¢ÂÂ Ehlers says. Ã¢ÂÂAnd those impacts can be lasting.Ã¢ÂÂ     ",cancer,The way we think about cancer is outdated. HereÃ¢ÂÂs how to change that.,2273.0,2273.0,273.0,
2274," Pharmaceutical companies will earn nearly $2 billion this year selling drugs that patients never take.    These are expensive cancer drugs that can cost upward of $13, 000 per month. A new study suggests that the way drug companies package these intravenous drugs  Ã¢ÂÂ   in   vials that contain way more medication than an average patient needs  Ã¢ÂÂ   ends up wasting a lot of money. Ã¢ÂÂWhat manufacturers are doing is theyÃ¢ÂÂre not   the vials to the dosages patients actually need,Ã¢ÂÂ says study author Peter Bach, who is a physician at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Cancer drugs are different from most other medications because they are delivered intravenously. Unlike pills that get dispensed out of a bottle, these are liquids or powders that will lose their potency if they sit on a shelf. Once opened, safety standards mandate that they must be used within six hours. After that, any leftovers have to go in the trash.    Bach and his   argue in their new paper, published Monday in the British Medical Journal, that some drug companies sell   dosages that inevitably lead to waste. This creates income from medication that hospitals and patients will never actually use. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs bad for the health care system but good for the drugmakers who net more revenue.    One drug only comes in 3. 5 milligram doses  Ã¢ÂÂ   even when patients only need a fraction of that One of the most striking examples of this oversizing is a drug called Velcade that treats multiple myeloma, a bone marrow cancer. Takeda Pharmaceutical, which makes Velcade, only sells the drug in 3. 5 milligram vials in the United States (the company does manufacture 1 milligram vials abroad).    The amount of medication that patients need turns out to be significantly smaller than the single dosage size. Using data on the weight distributions of cancer patients, Bach and his colleagues estimate that the average Velcade dose is 2. 2 milligrams. The green bars below represent the estimated dosage of Velcade (also know by the name of its active compound, bortezomib) that American cancer patients need. The red line represents the current dosage that VelcadeÃ¢ÂÂs manufacturer, Takeda, sells.         Each vial of Velcade contains 1. 3 milligram more medication than the average cancer patient needs. This disparity between vial size and patient dosage means hospitals will waste about 27 to 30 percent of the Velcade they purchase. TheyÃ¢ÂÂll spend $308 million on leftover Velcade that they never use.    I reached out to Takeda, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures Velcade, and spokesperson Amy Atwood told me the vial size was developed in coordination with the Food and Drug Administration. Ã¢ÂÂTakeda worked closely with the FDA to establish the VELCADE vial size of 3. 5 mg to ensure that one vial of VELCADE would provide an adequate amount of the drug for a patient of almost any size,Ã¢ÂÂ she wrote in an email. But there is a solution that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt create nearly as much waste, and allows for accurate dosing. A better way to package drugs  Ã¢ÂÂ   and save money Bach argues that this much leftover medication is pricey and unnecessary. As a counterexample to Velcade, he points to Treanda, a leukemia drug manufactured by Teva Pharmaceuticals. Teva sells its drug in 25, 45, 100, and 180 milligram vials. This means that providers can essentially mix and match the different vials to more closely match the dosage their patients need. You can see in this graph below how the different dosage combinations of Treanda (also known by the name of its active ingredient, bendamustine hydrochloride) overlay with the population of patients. The red bars show all the possible combinations of Treanda with those   vials.            This graph looks really different from the Velcade one; it shows that there are lots of dosage combinations. And that means less drug waste: Bach estimates about only 1 percent of all Treanda gets thrown out. Ã¢ÂÂWhen there are drugs where 30 percent are wasted and drugs with only 1 percent waste, its inconceivable that drug companies donÃ¢ÂÂt know about this,Ã¢ÂÂ Bach says. Ã¢ÂÂThese are extremely sophisticated businesses. They know everything about the patients getting their drugs, and certainly have the capability to figure out what weÃ¢ÂÂve described in this paper.Ã¢ÂÂ There are, however, risks to combining dosages: Using more than one vial of medication does leave more space for math errors on the part of the provider. This is why the FDA generally encourages single vials that have enough medication to treat a patient. If the FDA wanted to go further, it could more strictly regulate vial size  Ã¢ÂÂ   looking for dosages that are enough to treat the average patient but not so large that they lead to significant waste. And this is something that PhRMA, the trade group for drug companies, did express some openness toward. Ã¢ÂÂManufacturers are committed to working with FDA and Congress . .. to modify their products as we learn about the safety, efficacy and manufacturing of new medicines from the real world clinical setting,Ã¢ÂÂ PhRMA spokesperson Allyson Funk said in a statement.

2275," I hate to pick on a fellow news outlet, but this was a breathtaking example of irresponsible science hype from Mother Jones:              No. Please stop this. No one has established that cellphones cause cancer, particularly in humans. That headline and image combo is wildly misleading. You can find other bad headlines here and here. What actually happened is that scientists released the results of a big  Ã¢ÂÂ   but not yet    Ã¢ÂÂ   study in which they exposed rats to the sorts of radio frequency radiation emitted by cellphones and found higher incidences of two types of tumors in male rats, compared with a control group. (Though, oddly, the exposed rats also lived longer.) ItÃ¢ÂÂs the first study to show   radiation causing cancer. But there are major caveats here: This is just one study (we shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt dismiss it, but itÃ¢ÂÂs quite possible the results were simply due to chance). The effects were only found in rats (and may not translate at all to humans). And this needs to be weighed against other evidence that cellphones arenÃ¢ÂÂt a big risk for people (weÃ¢ÂÂve been using phones for decades now with no uptick in brain cancer). This is an important bit of research and deserves careful scrutiny and  . But itÃ¢ÂÂs not an occasion for  .    Look: Science moves slowly. Individual studies are often wrong, and itÃ¢ÂÂs rare for one paper to completely upend everything we know about a topic. There are very few genuinely Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ studies. And reporters need to do a better job of putting this incrementalism in context  Ã¢ÂÂ   rather than preying on peopleÃ¢ÂÂs fears for clicks.    (IÃ¢ÂÂll note that there were quite a few careful, nuanced stories on the cellphone study, including this from Rachel Feltman of the Washington Post and this from Megan Thielking and Dylan Scott of Stat News.) What the new study on cellphones, rats, and cancer found             The US National Toxicology Program, which is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) released the results of a big,   study in which researchers exposed rats to the types of radio frequency radiation that cellphones emit and compared them with a control group.    You can read the paper here. Note that the findings have been reviewed by other experts, but they havenÃ¢ÂÂt yet gone through a formal journal peer review, which may lead to further edits. An NIH spokesperson told Stat News that the agency is also reviewing the work. A careful summary of the results was done by Aaron Carroll, Professor of Pediatrics and Associate Dean for Research Mentoring at Indiana University School of Medicine. IÃ¢ÂÂll turn the mic over to him:  They exposed pregnant rats to whole body   and   radiofrequency radiation, for 9 hours a day, 7 days a week. Then they exposed 90 pups of each sex to three levels of each type of radiation for up to 2 years . .. At the end of the study, survival was lower in the control group of males than in all the exposed males. Survival was lower in the control group of females for two of the three exposed groups. Yet no headlines blared that cell phones extend life. Nor will mine. No statistics are presented on whether this is significant. Now letÃ¢ÂÂs get to brain cancer. There were no significant differences in the incidences of lesions in exposed male rats compared to controls. There was a Ã¢ÂÂstatistically significant positive trend in the incidence of malignant glioma (p < 0. 05) 16 for   RFR exposures.Ã¢ÂÂ Not GSM, though. No differences were seen in the female rats at all. The cardiac schwannomas [a type of heart tumor] were more compelling, but again, only for males. No differences for females. I didnÃ¢ÂÂt see any sample size calculation, nor any discussion of what they expected to see. One of the reviewers did a power calculation . .. and found that based on 90 rats per group, the power was about 14%. This means that false positives are very likely. The cancer difference was only seen in females, not males. The incidence of brain cancer in the exposed groups was well within the historical range. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no clear dose response. . .. And one more thing  Ã¢ÂÂ   the survival of male rats in the control group was relatively low, and if these tumors developed later in life, this could be the whole reason for the difference.     So: The researchers found an increased incidence of two types of tumors in male rats  Ã¢ÂÂ   malignant gliomas in the brain and schwannomas in the heart  Ã¢ÂÂ   after heavy exposure to cellphone radiation. But we canÃ¢ÂÂt rule out false positives. And the dangers arenÃ¢ÂÂt entirely  : note that the exposed rats actually lived longer than the unexposed rats. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the study. Now keep in mind these big caveats: 1) Single studies, even   studies like this one, donÃ¢ÂÂt always hold up. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why replication is so crucial in science. Other researchers need to dig into this study and try to reproduce its findings. 2) This study was done on rats. Rats have some similarities to humans, and can be good test subjects for medical research, but they are not identical to us. Science is littered with animal studies whose results donÃ¢ÂÂt carry over to humans. 3) The researchers treated the rats to very heavy amounts of radiation  Ã¢ÂÂ   nine hours a day, seven days a week  Ã¢ÂÂ   which is far more than most people spend holding their cellphones to their heads. (Many people nowadays rarely hold their cellphones up to their heads at all.) 4) ThereÃ¢ÂÂs a fair bit of countervailing evidence that cellphones arenÃ¢ÂÂt a major cancer risk. HereÃ¢ÂÂs Carroll again: Ã¢ÂÂCell phones are UBIQUITOUS in the United States. If they were causing cancer, we would expect to see rates of cancer going up, right? ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not what weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing. TheyÃ¢ÂÂve been decreasing since the late 1980s.Ã¢ÂÂ Other   studies have shown little evidence of cancer risk in humans from cellphone use.    ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not to dismiss this research, but it does suggest caution is warranted. Outside experts were much more cautious about the study Here are a few comments on the study from other scientists, courtesy of the Genetic Expert News Service. They add some   nuance and skepticism. Malcolm Sperrin, director of medical physics at Royal Berkshire Hospital in the United Kingdom, thought the study was Ã¢ÂÂinteresting and  Ã¢ÂÂ but merited careful  :  This is a very interesting and   study of the incidence of two types of tumour in rats.  The conclusions suggest that there is a small additional risk from exposure to RF [radiofrequency radiation] similar to that used in mobile phones, although the increase is very small. . .. However, the exposures given to the rats is high, the rats are clearly not human equivalent and perversely, the life expectancy of the rats exposed to the RF is marginally greater than the control. This report is a forerunner of a more comprehensive study but does lend credibility to the cautions necessary in very long RF exposures. . .. It should be borne in mind that the hypothesis of cancer genesis is not postulated and certainly does not reveal a link between normal domestic use of RF devices and health detriment, but does suggest that further studies are warranted.  Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University in Britain, pointed out that the uptick seen in rat tumors could well be due to chance. He noted that he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt intend to stop using his cellphone just yet:  The study is statistically underpowered. That means that not enough animals were used to allow the researchers to have a good chance of detecting a risk from radiofrequency radiation of the size one might plausibly expect, on the basis of previous findings.  . .. The concern here is that risks and effects that are detected in underpowered experiments often turn out to be exaggerated  Ã¢ÂÂ   they may or may not still be real effects, but further study shows them to be smaller than the original research indicated. ItÃ¢ÂÂs too soon to tell if that will be the case here. So here we have a study that found fairly weak evidence of small effects of mobile phone radiation on tumours in rats, where itÃ¢ÂÂs plausible that the effects are even smaller than what was found, and where itÃ¢ÂÂs not (yet) clear how far any such results are applicable to humans. IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to stop using my mobile phone in the light of this.     Rodney Croft, director of the Australian Centre for Electromagnetic Bioeffects Research, raised several key questions about the study and noted that it Ã¢ÂÂdoes not provide reason to move from the current scientific consensus that mobile   exposure does not impact healthÃ¢ÂÂ:  Of particular note is that the rats treated with RF lived longer than the controls (which is counter intuitive given that the increased tumour rates normally lead to reduced lifespan) the controls did not have Ã¢ÂÂanyÃ¢ÂÂ tumours (which is also not what is normally found) and the lack of clear   relationships raises the possibility that the results may merely be Ã¢ÂÂfalse positivesÃ¢ÂÂ (particularly given the large number of statistical comparisons, the one significant result would appear consistent with chance). It is also noteworthy that the results do not appear consistent with the cancer rates within the human population, nor with the majority of other experimental research, even at the very high exposure levels, which are many times higher than humans are exposed to. The NTP study will thus need to be fully evaluated once further details become available, and considered within the context of RF emissions science as a whole. At present though, and particularly given a range of uncertainties regarding its results, the NTP report does not provide reason to move from the current scientific consensus that mobile   exposure does not impact health.  This is how scientists usually think about any important new study. They take the results seriously, they point to questions that demand further investigation, but they remain skeptical that this is the last word. The press should strive to follow suit. Further reading:   Julia Belluz has previously written a terrific piece about how science is often flawed and we need to recognize that.

2276," A World Health Organization panel of experts on cancer risks just declared that drinking coffee may protect against some cancers. But if the coffee is too hot, it actually slightly increases the risk of other cancers.    The International Agency for Research on Cancer, an arm of the WHO, periodically makes declarations about the strength of evidence of a link between cancer and things like bacon, cellphones, or exposure to certain chemicals. In the case of coffee, the IARC reviewed more than 1, 000 studies in humans and animals and found there was Ã¢ÂÂinadequate evidenceÃ¢ÂÂ that coffee raises the risk of cancer. So the agency opted to categorize the beverage as Ã¢ÂÂunclassifiableÃ¢ÂÂ when it comes to its carcinogenicity. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a pretty confusing classification, but it means the evidence went in so many directions, depending on the type of cancer, that there was no way to say with certainty that coffee is generally safe.    There was some good news, however. Coffee didnÃ¢ÂÂt seem to raise the risk for pancreatic, breast, or prostate cancers, the experts wrote in an announcement, which was published along with a statement in the Lancet Oncology. Coffee drinking was also associated with a reduced risk of liver and endometrial cancer.    The data on more than 20 other cancers  Ã¢ÂÂ   including lung, colorectal, stomach, esophageal, oral cavity, ovarian, and brain cancers, and childhood leukemia  Ã¢ÂÂ   were too limited or inconsistent to draw any grand conclusions. Hence the categorization of coffee as Ã¢ÂÂunclassifiableÃ¢ÂÂ when it comes to its potential   properties.    Still, this declaration on coffee was a slight improvement over the IARCÃ¢ÂÂs 1991 finding that coffee was Ã¢ÂÂpossibly carcinogenic.Ã¢ÂÂ  (The IARC classifies carcinogens in five categories ranging from carcinogenic to humans to probably not carcinogenic to humans.) That concern was based on some evidence that suggested coffee drinking might be linked with urinary bladder cancer. This time, with much more evidence at their disposal, the researchers found that there was Ã¢ÂÂno consistent evidenceÃ¢ÂÂ of an association between drinking coffee and bladder cancer, according to the groupÃ¢ÂÂs   in the Lancet. Also note: The IARC is only looking at cancer risks. And coffee is also associated with other   health effects, including lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why the most recent US dietary guidelines suggested that drinking three to five cups per day could actually be part of a healthy diet.    Hot drinks raise the risk of esophageal cancer  Ã¢ÂÂ   by a little more than half a percentage point           (Shutterstock) The IARC had a much more declarative statement on very hot beverages: They are Ã¢ÂÂprobably carcinogenicÃ¢ÂÂ for humans. This was based on evidence from hot beverage Ã¢ÂÂ  loving countries like China, Iran, Turkey, and Argentina. There, researchers uncovered positive associations between people who drink hot teas or matÃÂ© (a traditional South American caffeine drink) and esophageal cancer specifically. The risk here has to do with how very hot beverages damage the lining of the esophagus, potentially triggering   genetic mutations or making it easier for carcinogens  Ã¢ÂÂ   like cigarette smoke  Ã¢ÂÂ   to flow into the cells. As Mariana Stern, an associate professor at the Keck School of Medicine at USC who worked with the IARC, explained in a statement, Ã¢ÂÂThere is physical evidence that very hot beverages can contribute to cell injury in the esophagus and thus contribute to cancer formation.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂEnjoy your coffee or matÃÂ©, but make sure itÃ¢ÂÂs not very hot,Ã¢ÂÂ she added. These risks need to be put into perspective, though. The overall lifetime risk of developing esophageal cancer is very low, and hot beverages would only raise it by a tiny amount. Thomas Sherman, an associate professor in the department of pharmacology and physiology at Georgetown University Medical Center, explained in a statement from the Genetic Expert News Service that very hot drinks raise a personÃ¢ÂÂs absolute risk of cancer by about 2. 4 times compared with someone who doesnÃ¢ÂÂt drink very hot beverages. Since the lifetime risk of developing esophageal cancer is about 0. 5 percent, hot drinks would bring that risk up to a little more than 1 percent. Ã¢ÂÂAs an absolute cancer risk, very hot beverage consumption is very low compared to known carcinogens, including alcohol,Ã¢ÂÂ he added.  ThereÃ¢ÂÂs another thing to keep in mind here: In the countries where the cancer association was discovered, people typically drink their hot teas or matÃÂ©s at temperatures that exceed 150 degrees Fahrenheit, which many of us would consider to be scalding. Though chains like Starbucks and McDonaldÃ¢ÂÂs brew their coffee at comparable temperatures, researchers have found the sweet spot for drinking is about 136 degrees Fahrenheit.    So as long as you let your drink cool down a bit from the scalding point, there is little to fear in your cup of joe (or matÃÂ©).

2277,"            For a long time, if you lived in America, there was a very good chance youÃ¢ÂÂd die of heart disease. For more than half a century, itÃ¢ÂÂs been far and away the leading cause of death here.    In recent years, however, the picture has started to change. The gap is narrowing between deaths due to heart disease and deaths caused by cancer in the United States, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After peaking in 1985, heart disease deaths have been falling (with a small uptick after 2010). Meanwhile, the number of deaths from cancer has nearly tripled since the 1950s.            The general rise in both diseases in the last half century is Ã¢ÂÂlargely due to the aging of the U. S. population,Ã¢ÂÂ the CDC report states. But in the 1980s, the trend started to change: The gap between the two causes of death narrowed.    This means that while heart disease remains the leading killer in America, in some states cancer has caught up or passed it. Ã¢ÂÂBy 2014, cancer had replaced heart disease as the leading cause of death in 22 states,Ã¢ÂÂ according to the report, or in about half of the country. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a big change. In coming years, cancer deaths could even outstrip heart disease deaths for the first time.    So whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on here? It turns out several other   countries are also seeing cancer deaths creep up while heart disease deaths decline. There are a few reasons for this. As a 2016 report from the American Cancer Society shows, better cancer detection means more cases are being diagnosed that would have otherwise gone unnoticed.             Americans are also simply living longer, and the overwhelming majority  Ã¢ÂÂ   86 percent  Ã¢ÂÂ   of all cancers in the US are diagnosed in older people, over the age of 50.    But while more people may be dying from cancer, the cancer death rate has actually been declining since the early 1990s. (In other words, of the people diagnosed with the disease, fewer are now dying from it.) These changes are mainly attributed gains in early detection and treatment advances, as well as declines in the smoking rate. The drop in heart disease deaths is also clearly good news. According to the American Heart Association, it can also be attributed in part to the decline in smoking, as well as improvements in emergency care for heart disease patients, medications and procedures, and increased awareness about healthy eating and lifestyle.    The big picture          HereÃ¢ÂÂs what these death trends look like over the life span. Nathan Yau at Flowing Data used mortality information from the CDC from 2005 to 2014 to make death trend graphics for men and women from the age of 0 to 100. The chart shows percentages  Ã¢ÂÂ   not absolute counts  Ã¢ÂÂ   for the 20 categories of disease deaths the CDC tracks, as well as deaths from external causes. And you can see how much the risks change as we age. For example, the risk of death from chronic diseases like cancer, circulatory causes (i. e. heart disease) and respiratory issues (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) starts to rise at about age 20 and keep climbing. Meanwhile, the risk of death from Ã¢ÂÂexternal causesÃ¢ÂÂ (like traffic accidents) starts to shrink at about 20. In the chart below, youÃ¢ÂÂll notice the trend lines look remarkably similar for women, except for when it comes to external causes. Yau points out, Ã¢ÂÂFor females, it [deaths from external causes] accounts for about 5 percent of deaths. ItÃ¢ÂÂs twice as common for males, and mostly at a young age  .Ã¢ÂÂ             These trends have dramatically morphed over time. YauÃ¢ÂÂs data covers a recent period (again, from 2005 to 2014). But if you go all the way back to 1900, as the New England Journal of Medicine did in the chart below, you can get an even richer view of how causes of death have transformed:            The illnesses that did us in in 1900  Ã¢ÂÂ    when life expectancy at birth was 47  Ã¢ÂÂ   are quite different from what we see in 2010, when Americans could expect to live until 79. Chronic illnesses (such as cancer and heart disease) as well as diseases of aging (AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs) have overtaken infectious diseases like tuberculosis. The newest CDC data suggests that in a few years, the bar for cancer will be even larger.  ",cancer,"Cancer is now the leading cause of death in 22 states.

Ã¢ÂÂBiking, swimming,   and bird hunting remain active interests  Ã¢ÂÂ   but in a new context.Ã¢ÂÂ While his cancer is now in remission, it continues to shadow his life: Ã¢ÂÂMorning, noon and night, asleep and awake, malignant cells are determined to alter or end your life. Combating cancer is a   job that, in my case, requires 24 pills a day, including one that runs $500 a dose.Ã¢ÂÂ    Brokaw then describes what sounds like another   job: making sure thoughts about dying donÃ¢ÂÂt consume whatÃ¢ÂÂs left of his life, and that he learns to accept his illness. Ã¢ÂÂThis cancer ordeal is by far the worst, though it has redeeming qualities,Ã¢ÂÂ he writes. Cancer has heightened his awareness about the fragility of life, brought him fellowship with other patients, and made him appreciate the Ã¢ÂÂdoctors and laboratory technicians who spend their lives in tedious pursuit of a cure.Ã¢ÂÂ BrokawÃ¢ÂÂs insights are important because they reflect a new reality. While the Ã¢ÂÂCÃ¢ÂÂ word can conjure up so much dread and shame in patients, cancer is often no longer a death sentence but a chronic disease that people need to learn to live with.   The cancer death rate has dropped by 23 percent since 1991, with some even larger gains in types of cancer that used to be extremely lethal. This means there are more and more patients, like Brokaw, who are neither dying from cancer nor defeating it entirely.    Some patients  Ã¢ÂÂ   notably Oliver Sacks, Christopher Hitchens, and Robin Roberts  Ã¢ÂÂ   have gone public with the details of their cancer experience. And we have a lot to learn from them. With insights like theirs on what it means to live with  Ã¢ÂÂ   and, most importantly accept  Ã¢ÂÂ   cancer as part of life, maybe some of the shame and dread will go away.

2279," October is Breast Cancer Awareness month, and with the flurry of pink ribbons comes new studies about the harms and benefits of mammograms for   screening. Every year, confusion ensues.    The whole idea behind cancer screening is that it can help find the disease earlier  Ã¢ÂÂ   even before symptoms appear. With early   detection, doctors should, in theory, be more likely to successfully treat the disease and control any spread.            But as this chart, from the latest issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, shows, the introduction of mass mammography screening  Ã¢ÂÂ   for all women over the age of 40  Ã¢ÂÂ   has failed to deliver on this promise. Despite widespread screening programs, incidences of metastatic cancers (or   cancers that have already spread and are therefore more deadly) have remained stubbornly stable since 1975.    Meanwhile, the rate of finding small (Ã¢ÂÂinvasiveÃ¢ÂÂ) tumors has increased by 30 percent.    This gets at the heart of the controversy about   screening. If mass mammography was a total   success, weÃ¢ÂÂd see the red line for metastatic cancer drop at the same time the blue line for small cancers rises. Instead, researchers increasingly worry, mammography has failed to reduce illness and death in women with   disease. Conversely, more women with tumors that may have never advanced to anything serious are undergoing difficult, costly procedures like surgery and chemotherapy.    This is far from the first time researchers have questioned the effects of mass mammography. A 2015 study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, found more breast cancer screening didnÃ¢ÂÂt actually save lives. It did however lead to more Ã¢ÂÂoverdiagnosisÃ¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ   detecting cancers that would not have been fatal or even harmful. In more than 500 US counties, that study found, mammography screening programs were linked with more diagnoses of smaller breast cancers  Ã¢ÂÂ   but not with fewer deaths or with fewer larger breast cancers (which theoretically would be prevented by finding the disease early through screening). So, again, more patients and treatments, but not fewer deaths.             While this means mass mammography programs targeting all women may be delivering more harms than benefits and should therefore be reconsidered, it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean no one should get screened.    Right now, health groups offer different advice about when women should start annual screening. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has some of the most aggressive guidance, recommending age 40 as the start time. Meanwhile, the US Preventive Services Task Force  Ã¢ÂÂ   an   group that governments and insurers usually follow  Ã¢ÂÂ   suggests screening every two years starting at age 50. So the decision is really left to women and their individual values, preferences, and risks. Those with a family history of the disease, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations, or habits like smoking may consider initiating screening sooner. Those who donÃ¢ÂÂt may consider waiting. Doctors can also help patients by more often explaining both the harms and risks of mammography and factors that contribute to their individual   risk profiles.

2280," Three years ago, Angelina Jolie announced in a New York Times   that sheÃ¢ÂÂd had a preventive double mastectomy after testing positive for mutations in the BRCA1 gene, which put her at an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers.    The article went hugely viral, and became a flashpoint in the debate about breast cancer risk and prevention. It also spurred a bunch of researchers to study what impact JolieÃ¢ÂÂs decision might have on mastectomy rates and testing for the   BRCA1 and 2 genetic mutations. In the latest paper, published in the BMJ, researchers from Harvard looked at insurance data from nearly 10 million women before and after JolieÃ¢ÂÂs May 2013 editorial. In the two weeks following the article, they found that BRCA testing rates shot up by 65 percent. But mastectomy rates remained unchanged in the months after that. If more women with the mutation, like Jolie, were being diagnosed, the researchers expected to find an increase in these surgeries, one of the   Sunita Desai, explained. Ã¢ÂÂThe other possible explanation is that the [Jolie] editorial was responsible for an increase in rate of BRCA mutation diagnoses but that these women were for some reason less likely to undergo mastectomy,Ã¢ÂÂ she added. Ã¢ÂÂWe think this is a less likely explanation. If anything, given the content of JolieÃ¢ÂÂs article [in which she shares her own decision to undergo a  ] we are predicting that it would lead women to be more likely to undergo mastectomy.Ã¢ÂÂ              These BRCA1 and 2 mutations are rare, and most experts agree only women with a very particular family history and risk profile should bother getting tested. Yet the study suggests women may have followed Jolie into medical screening they didnÃ¢ÂÂt need.        ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not to mention the cost to the health system: At about $3, 000 per test, the researchers estimate this   surge led to $14 million in health care spending in those two weeks alone. And the Ã¢ÂÂJolie effectÃ¢ÂÂ seemed to persist long after the   appeared. Average monthly test rates increased from 16 tests per 100, 000 women between January and April 2013 to 21 tests per 100, 000 women after the   during May through December that year.    In sum, this looks like a case of   overtesting, the researchers wrote: Ã¢ÂÂCelebrity announcements can reach a broad audience but may not effectively target the population that would benefit most from the test.Ã¢ÂÂ This is just one of many examples of where a celebrity says something about health and we follow like sheep. In 2000, Katie CouricÃ¢ÂÂs awareness campaign about colorectal screening led to an increase in colonoscopy use, and was dubbed the Ã¢ÂÂKatie Couric effect.Ã¢ÂÂ News of Kylie MinogueÃ¢ÂÂs announcement about a breast cancer diagnosis in 2005 led to an Ã¢ÂÂunprecedented increaseÃ¢ÂÂ in mammography bookings. After Charlie Sheen disclosed  last year that he was   researchers sifted through Google search information and found that his announcement Ã¢ÂÂcorresponded with the greatest number of   Google searches ever recorded in the United States. Ã¢ÂÂOther studies have found evidence of the Ã¢ÂÂJolie effect:Ã¢ÂÂ an uptick in referrals to genetic testing centers and online web searches about preventive mastectomies and the genetics of breast and ovarian cancer after the  . Ã¢ÂÂThe research  Ã¢ÂÂ   on the aggregate, at the population level  Ã¢ÂÂ   says itÃ¢ÂÂs clear: Celebrity culture, celebrity endorsements, have an impact,Ã¢ÂÂ said Tim Caulfield, a researcher and author of the book Is Gwyneth Paltrow Wrong About Everything?. Ã¢ÂÂNow we can debate whether thatÃ¢ÂÂs good or bad.Ã¢ÂÂ    The celebrity health impact usually isnÃ¢ÂÂt very positive JolieÃ¢ÂÂs efforts to raise awareness about the BRCA genes were probably helpful for women who may also carry the mutations that can lead to cancer. But the rarity of the BRCA 1 and 2 mutations seemed to be lost on the public. As far as celebrity health statements go, JolieÃ¢ÂÂs    Ã¢ÂÂ   and another that followed  Ã¢ÂÂ   was actually quite measured in how she characterized risk. Ã¢ÂÂMy doctors estimated that I had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer, although the risk is different in the case of each woman,Ã¢ÂÂ she wrote. Ã¢ÂÂOnly a fraction of breast cancers result from an inherited gene mutation.Ã¢ÂÂ Jolie clearly tried to convey the uniqueness of her situation and the fact that it may not apply to all women. That didnÃ¢ÂÂt translate to more public understanding, however. One study, in Genetics in Medicine, looked at the effect JolieÃ¢ÂÂs   had on public awareness. It found that she did not actually help to improve peopleÃ¢ÂÂs understanding of breast and ovarian cancer risk. Ã¢ÂÂWhile three of four Americans were aware of Angelina JolieÃ¢ÂÂs double mastectomy,Ã¢ÂÂ the University of Maryland researchers wrote, Ã¢ÂÂfewer than 10 percent of respondents had the information necessary to accurately interpret Ms. JolieÃ¢ÂÂs risk of developing cancer relative to a woman unaffected by the BRCA gene mutation.Ã¢ÂÂ The news media, which often botches risk communication, is partly to blame for this. Another article, also published in Genetics in Medicine (and   by Caulfield) found that journalists took an overwhelmingly positive slant on JolieÃ¢ÂÂs preventive surgery, instead of discussing the relative rarity of her genetic mutation and the fact that most women would have many other options besides a double mastectomy. Celebrity health endorsements, no matter how   and carefully crafted, frequently lead to misunderstanding. But there are exceptions, Caulfield said: Ã¢ÂÂCelebrities are most helpful in areas where the message is straightforward and simple  Ã¢ÂÂ   wear your seatbelt, donÃ¢ÂÂt smoke, eat fruits and vegetables.Ã¢ÂÂ They are less instructive when the messages are complex, like communicating individual genetic risk information. So we should keep the Jolie case study in mind next time we hear a celebrity with a health message thatÃ¢ÂÂs more nuanced than Ã¢ÂÂeat your broccoli.Ã¢ÂÂ Update: This piece was updated with additional information on why the researchers thought the Jolie   may have inspired unnecessary BRCA tests.

The governor fainted Monday night, slurring his words and then striking his head on a lectern as he fell to the floor. His staffers caught him, and legislators immediately adjourned the meeting at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul. The governorÃ¢ÂÂs chief of staff said in a statement that Ã¢ÂÂhe quickly recovered, walked out of the Capitol, and returned home,Ã¢ÂÂ where he was checked out by emergency personnel.

(Glen   Tribune via AP)  During TuesdayÃ¢ÂÂs afternoon news conference, Dayton (D) 69, said he had planned to disclose information about the cancer next week after further tests and visits with his doctor to determine the best course of treatment. But, he said, following his sudden fainting spell, he decided to go ahead with the public announcement. Dayton added that his treatment could include radiation or surgery to remove a tumor. Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt expect it to impede my performance or responsibilities,Ã¢ÂÂ he told reporters, Ã¢ÂÂbut IÃ¢ÂÂll know more next week. Ã¢ÂÂ      Gov.

Lawmakers rushed to help escort the    governor out of the chamber, and his staff reported that he Ã¢ÂÂquickly recoveredÃ¢ÂÂ at home and will resume his normal schedule on Jan. 24. (Video: KSTP   Photo: Scott   Press via AP)   Aside from skin cancer, prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men in the United States, according to the National Institutes of Health. Earlier data from NIH estimated that more than 180, 000 men would be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2016, and more than 26, 000 would die from it. In its early stages, prostate cancer may not need treatment, according to the Mayo Clinic. But when treatment becomes necessary, doctors may consider hormone or other therapies, radiology, chemotherapy or surgery to remove the prostate gland, according to the Mayo Clinic. The governor said his tumor was discovered during an annual examination and a biopsy confirmed it was cancer late last week, but there is no evidence to suggest that it has spread beyond the prostate. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs grim, but it is what it is,Ã¢ÂÂ Dayton said of the diagnosis, adding: Ã¢ÂÂYou have to do what you have to do in life. Ã¢ÂÂ This isnÃ¢ÂÂt the first time Dayton has struggled with his health, according to the Star Tribune. He had a similar fainting spell about the same time last year at a political event; his senior adviser said he was hospitalized and treated for dehydration, according to the Tribune. He has also had trouble with his back, undergoing two surgeries in recent years to help treat spinal stenosis. On Monday, during the State of the State address, Dayton had appeared to stumble as he made his way into the house chamber, according to the Associated Press. He later said he was sweating a bit but was not aware of any issues. Ã¢ÂÂIt just came up on me before I could do anything about it,Ã¢ÂÂ he told reporters during TuesdayÃ¢ÂÂs news conference. About 40 minutes into his address, the governor started to tremble and lost his place in his speech, according to the AP. He took several sips of water before he fell to the floor. Not long after the fall, however, the governor had reportedly bounced back and was making fun of himself, state Sen. Dan Schoen said, the AP reported. DaytonÃ¢ÂÂs son, Eric Dayton, said in a tweet that his father was Ã¢ÂÂdoing great. Ã¢ÂÂ He later tweeted a photo of his father and DaytonÃ¢ÂÂs grandson, Hugo, making an Ã¢ÂÂadvanced puzzleÃ¢ÂÂ together, adding, Ã¢ÂÂthat must be a good sign!Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂGovernor Dayton and his entire staff thank the people of Minnesota for their outpouring of support and concern,Ã¢ÂÂ the statement read. On Tuesday, the governor seemed in high spirits, saying he was grateful for the outpouring of support he had received, then he started poking fun at the situation. Ã¢ÂÂIf IÃ¢ÂÂd known that it was going to result in the Republicans not criticizing my speech,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂd have tried it years ago. Ã¢ÂÂ Before fainting Monday night, Dayton unveiled a broad vision for his final two years in office, calling for targeted Ã¢ÂÂpublic investmentsÃ¢ÂÂ that include $371 million in additional funding for schools and the creation of a public health insurance option, the Star Tribune reported. He touted a falling unemployment rate and a projected budget surplus of $1. 4 billion, a substantial improvement from the massive budget deficit facing the state six years ago. He also discussed the need to address a number of problems in the state, including aging roads and bridges, diminished water quality and racial disparities. Dayton faces pressures from the    legislature to make broad   changes and offset massive premium hikes. This post has been updated.

2283,"     Rates of colon and rectal cancer are rising sharply among young and   Americans, at the same time that they continue to decline for adults 55 and older, according to a startling new study that is sparking questions about whether screening should start earlier. The study, published Tuesday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, found that between the   and 2013, colon cancer rates increased about 1 to 2 percent per year for people in their 20s and 30s. Rates for   adults also rose, but at a slower pace. Rectal cancer rates climbed even faster in recent decades, at about 3 percent per year for people in their 20s and 30s and 2 percent annually for those ages 40 to 54. As a result, three in 10 new cases of rectal cancer now are diagnosed in patients younger than 55  Ã¢ÂÂ   double the proportion in 1990. By contrast, rectal cancer rates in adults ages 55 and older have dropped for four decades. American Cancer Society researcher Rebecca Siegel, who led the study, said that earlier work had signaled a growing incidence of colorectal cancer among the groups known as Gen X and millennials. But the magnitude of the increase identified Ã¢ÂÂwas just very shocking,Ã¢ÂÂ she said.   [Cancer patients, survivors, fear Republican bid to gut the Affordable Care Act]   The study, which included scientists at the NCI, didnÃ¢ÂÂt determine the reason for the shift. But Siegel suggested one explanation might be a complex interaction involving the same factors that have contributed to the obesity epidemic  Ã¢ÂÂ   changes in diet, a sedentary lifestyle, excess weight and low fiber consumption. Experts said the cancers are not related to the human papilloma virus. HPV is associated with squamous cell cancers, which are common in   anal cancer, but not in colorectal cancers. Colorectal cancer refers to malignancies in the colon or rectum, which are parts of the large intestine. Most cancers there start as polyps, or growths, on an inner wall. Most polyps are benign, but over time some can develop into cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that more than 95, 000 new cases of colon cancer and almost 40, 000 new cases of rectal cancer will be diagnosed in 2017. About 50, 000 people are expected to die of colorectal cancer in the United States this year.       The latest research involved a retrospective look at more than 490, 000 people ages 20 and older who received diagnoses of invasive colorectal cancer between 1974 and 2013, with a specific focus on years of birth and   age groups. By comparing different generations at similar ages, it found that people born around 1990 have double the risk of colon cancer and quadruple the risk of rectal cancer of people born around 1950. Jessica Dilts, 34, of New Hudson, Mich. was a fitness devotee and   runner when she noticed blood in her stool in October 2014. Her gastroenterologist dismissed her symptoms as hemorrhoids or an intestinal disorder; a year later, after her symptoms worsened, she had a colonoscopy and was diagnosed with rectal cancer that already had spread to her lungs and liver. Ã¢ÂÂI was in shock,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂMy whole world changed that day  Ã¢ÂÂ   I could hardly get out of bed. Ã¢ÂÂ She began an aggressive chemotherapy regimen and expects to be on maintenance chemotherapy indefinitely. For now, she is doing well. Her lung tumors have disappeared, and those in her liver are shrinking. SheÃ¢ÂÂs working full time in sales and getting married in June.   [Cancer death rate has declined again, but is higher in men.]   The study confirms what many doctors have been seeing among their younger patients, said Nilofer Azad, an oncologist at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, who was not involved in the research. Ã¢ÂÂI have many patients in their 30s and 40s, and some in their 20s,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Azad stressed that the incidence of colorectal cancer in young people, while on the rise, remains very low. The disease will be diagnosed in just 1 in 100, 000 people in their 20s compared with about 50 in 100, 000 people in their early 60s, according to data used in the study. Ã¢ÂÂThe vast majority of young people wonÃ¢ÂÂt get colorectal cancer, and their symptoms are more likely not the disease,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Still, she added, itÃ¢ÂÂs critical that young people who have symptoms  Ã¢ÂÂ   which include rectal bleeding or a change in bowel habits  Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂpush their doctors if the problem doesnÃ¢ÂÂt resolve. Ã¢ÂÂ Young people often are diagnosed at a later stage because, unlike older Americans, they arenÃ¢ÂÂt getting screened, and doctors donÃ¢ÂÂt necessarily suspect cancer, Azad noted.     Recommendations by the American Cancer Society and other expert groups generally have called for colonoscopies or other tests starting at age 50 for a person with average risk but earlier screening for individuals with a family history of cancer. Some of those recommendations are under review.  Ã¢ÂÂWe need to do a new analysis to see if we should start screening earlier, like at 45,Ã¢ÂÂ Azad said. With colorectal cancer rates increasing for people in their early 50s but decreasing for those in their late 50s, the study found a strikingly smaller gap in incidence within just that decade of life. The younger groupÃ¢ÂÂs rate used to be half that of the older group; it now is just 12 percent lower. Accountant Dorothy OÃ¢ÂÂShea of Marlborough, Mass. refused when her   provider urged her to get a colonoscopy at age 50. As a runner and vegetarian, she said she didnÃ¢ÂÂt see the need to undergo screening. Then a close friend was diagnosed with colorectal cancer and begged her to get tested. She decided to use the   Cologuard test, which involves sending a stool sample to a lab that looks for abnormal cells. Two weeks later, her doctor got the results, which indicated there might be a problem. At that point, she readily underwent a colonoscopy and was diagnosed with Stage 1 colon cancer. She has now changed her mind: Ã¢ÂÂI really think that everyone should get screened in their 40s. Ã¢ÂÂ      $(function() );    Read more: Defeating cancer: War or moonshot?

2284,"     More than   of   mutations are the result of random mistakes in DNA replication that occur when normal cells divide, according to a paper published Thursday. The study is sure to renew a vigorous debate over how much people can do to prevent cancer and how much is unavoidable. The researchers, mathematician Cristian Tomasetti and cancer geneticist Bert Vogelstein, both of Johns Hopkins University, set out to determine what proportion of cancer mutations are due to unpredictable   errors  Ã¢ÂÂ   as opposed to the two other main contributors to cancer, inherited genes and environmental factors, such as smoking and obesity. For their study, published in Science, the scientists used a mathematical model that analyzed genome sequencing and epidemiological data for 32 types of cancer. Overall, they concluded, 66 percent of mutations that contribute to cancer are due to unavoidable   mistakes, while 29 percent are attributable to environmental factors and 5 percent to heredity. That doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean that   of cancer cases are caused by random copying errors, they said; it can take three, four or more mutations to make a cell turn malignant. Moreover, the proportion of mutations due to random copying errors varies depending on the cancer, the researchers said. Random   mistakes account for about 77 percent of critical mutations in pancreatic cancer, and virtually all childhood cancer, they said. By contrast, they concluded that more than   of the mutations in lung cancer were due to environmental factors, mostly smoking. Humans have trillions of cells, which are constantly regenerating by dividing and making new cells. But each time DNA is copied, the scientists said, an average of three random mistakes will occur. While most are harmless, a small number affect genes that will promote cancer. The new research builds on a 2015 study that highlighted the role of Ã¢ÂÂbad luckÃ¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ   random DNA errors  Ã¢ÂÂ   in developing cancer. That study drew vehement protests from some cancer physicians and researchers who worried it would encourage people to take a fatalistic approach to cancer rather than trying to reduce their cancer risk by maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, eating a good diet and avoiding cigarettes. The Hopkins researchers have said their earlier work was widely misinterpreted. Nevertheless, in a news briefing earlier this week, they took pains to stress that their study was consistent with estimates that 40 percent of cancers can be prevented, and urged the public to pursue healthy lifestyles. But they also said it is important for scientists and the public to recognize that a large percentage of cancer mutations occur no matter how pristine the environment or how laudable someoneÃ¢ÂÂs lifestyle choices. Ã¢ÂÂMost of the enemies are inside us  Ã¢ÂÂ   they are already here,Ã¢ÂÂ Vogelstein said, referring to the random   mutations. He said that science needs to find better ways to detect cancer early, when there is a greater chance of curing it.   [Proposed Trump budget would devastate cancer research, advocates say]   Vogelstein also argued that the new research about random mutations should offer comfort to people who develop cancer despite having Ã¢ÂÂ  lifestyles,Ã¢ÂÂ as well as to parents who are worried that they somehow Ã¢ÂÂgaveÃ¢ÂÂ their children cancer, either by passing on a harmful gene or inadvertently exposing them to an environmental toxin. Ã¢ÂÂWe donÃ¢ÂÂt need to add guilt to an already tragic situation,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Tomasetti said the work represented a paradigm shift because it marked the first time that researchers had measured the respective contributions of the three dominant causes of cancer mutations. Some researchers were skeptical, echoing the criticism of the 2015 work. Ã¢ÂÂThey say randomness is a major cause of cancer, and they said it last time,Ã¢ÂÂ said Anne McTiernan, an internist and epidemiologist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Ã¢ÂÂBut the data doesnÃ¢ÂÂt convince me. Ã¢ÂÂ She said that environmental causes of cancer have long been underestimated and that estimates on their contribution to cancer will increase as more is learned. Yusuf Hannun, director of the Stony Brook University Cancer Center, agreed, arguing that the 66 percent contribution of random DNA errors to mutation was Ã¢ÂÂway exaggerated. Ã¢ÂÂ In late 2015, a team he led reported that the vast proportion of lifetime cancer risk is due to environmental factors. Others welcomed the new Hopkins study. Brian Druker, director of the Oregon Health and Science UniversityÃ¢ÂÂs Knight Cancer Institute, said it provided a data framework Ã¢ÂÂto understand much of what we already know about cancer epidemiology. Ã¢ÂÂ Often, he said, he sees cancer patients who have had a healthy lifestyle and are looking for an explanation for their disease. Ã¢ÂÂOften there isnÃ¢ÂÂt one,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.  Daniel Haber, director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, said it is beside the point to focus on the specific percentage of cancer risk contributed by random errors, environmental factors and heredity. The most important point, he said, is the need for early cancer detection  Ã¢ÂÂ   something that medicine now is Ã¢ÂÂvery badÃ¢ÂÂ at. In their 2015 study, Tomasetti and Vogelstein compared cancer incidence in the United States to the total number of cell divisions to different kinds of tissues in the body. They wanted to determine why, for example, cancer is more likely to develop in the colon than in the brain. They found a strong correlation between cancer incidence and the number of times the stem cells in the tissues divide. They figured that the more cells divide, the higher the potential for random   mistakes  Ã¢ÂÂ   and attributed the errors to Ã¢ÂÂbad luck. Ã¢ÂÂ But critics disliked the Ã¢ÂÂbad luckÃ¢ÂÂ explanation and complained that the study was limited to the United States and didnÃ¢ÂÂt include the most common cancers  Ã¢ÂÂ   breast and prostate. In a new analysis also reported Thursday, which included information on breast and prostate cancers, Tomasetti and Vogelstein said they had done additional work that confirmed and broadened their 2015 conclusions. They examined 17 cancer types in 69 countries and found a strong correlation between the number of   divisions and the incidence of the disease, regardless of the countriesÃ¢ÂÂ environment or state of economic development.

2285,"     Henrietta Lacks probably didnÃ¢ÂÂt seem so immortal to doctors when she was first diagnosed at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1951. The poor    African American woman  Ã¢ÂÂ   the subject of a   book, Ã¢ÂÂThe Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,Ã¢ÂÂ and a new HBO movie starring Oprah Winfrey  Ã¢ÂÂ   was suffering from cervical cancer.    Ã¢ÂÂIt was generally a death sentence then,Ã¢ÂÂ said Patricia Eifel, a professor of radiation oncology at the  MD Anderson Center in Houston. Today, the disease is considered a cancer success story. Routine screening and improved treatment have driven its rates down from a major cause of death among women to one the rarest: Cervical cancer ranks just 14th in cancer frequency, and deaths from the disease have fallen some 70 percent since the 1950s. But when Lacks, a mother of five, was being treated in East Baltimore during the Truman era, it was an illness clouded in secrecy, shame and dread. It wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be until the 1980s that the sexually transmitted Human Papillomavirus (HPV) was identified as the cause of most cervical cancer, but it was still had whispered associations with sex, a disease of the poor and promiscuous. Ã¢ÂÂNuns famously didnÃ¢ÂÂt get cervical cancer, you would hear that in medical school,Ã¢ÂÂ said Eifel, who has worked in the field for 30 years. Lacks, in the public Ã¢ÂÂcolored wardsÃ¢ÂÂ of the   hospital, got the standard treatment for invasive cervical cancer at the time. Doctors stitched tubes and pouches filled with radium inside her cervix, sewing them and packing them in place. At the same time, without her knowledge or consent, the surgeon snipped a sample of her tumor for a research team down the hall. Those cells grew robustly in the lab and became the famous Ã¢ÂÂHeLaÃ¢ÂÂ line of cells that would transform medical research, even as LacksÃ¢ÂÂs children struggled to understand their motherÃ¢ÂÂs fate. That story of discovery, ethics and race is told in the HBO movie debuting Saturday.       HBO Films chronicles the story of Henrietta Lacks, a mother whose cells were harvested without her knowledge and then led to medical breakthroughs, and her familyÃ¢ÂÂs attempt to reclaim her legacy. (HBO)   As the HeLa cells thrived, Henrietta herself failed, dying in agony a few months after the treatment. Ã¢ÂÂShe really had her cancer at the wrong time,Ã¢ÂÂ Eifel said. One month after Lacks was buried, another woman whose name would live forever was wheeled into an operating room to be treated for cervical cancer, and she didnÃ¢ÂÂt even know it. Eva Peron, the glamorous and powerful wife of Argentinian President Juan Peron, was never told she had the disease. Evita thought she was having a procedure by a leading Buenos Aries surgeon to stop some cervical bleeding. Instead, after she was anesthetized, George Pack, a cancer specialist from New York who had been flown secretly to South America, entered the O. R. and performed a radical hysterectomy. There was a such a taboo around cancer that many doctors didnÃ¢ÂÂt want to use the   at all, lest the patient lose hope Ã¢ÂÂ  or commit suicide Ã¢ÂÂ  at a time when cancer seemed always to lead to a coffin. Ã¢ÂÂThere were a lot of euphemisms used at that time: Ã¢ÂÂYou have a tumor,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂYou have an inflammation that we need to take out,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ said Barron Lerner, a physician and medical historian at New York University who has written about the Peron case.    The body Eva Peron was publicly displayed after she died of cervical cancer in 1952. (  Images)  With Peron, of course, politics and power also played a role in the secrecy. But even when the surgery failed to stop the cancer, and she went into a painful decline, she was kept in the dark. Peron and Lacks fell to cervical cancer right at the beginning of a new age in fighting the disease. The biggest breakthrough was the introduction of a remarkably effective test for   cells developed by a   violin player and doctor named George Papanicolaou. His simple Ã¢ÂÂpap smear,Ã¢ÂÂ which allowed doctors to treat and cure the cancer before it became established, was just coming into general use as a screening tool when Lacks fell ill. By the early 1960s, radiation therapy was becoming more refined, too, with cobalt beams and linear accelerators allowing for targeted dosages that didnÃ¢ÂÂt wreak such damage in surrounding tissue. Better anesthesia and surgical techniques boosted survival rates. Procedures that spared a womanÃ¢ÂÂs ability to have children made many of them more willing to undergo treatment. And then came the drugs. Lerner noted that Peron was given a nitrogen mustard concoction in a   attempt to arrest her cancer, reportedly making her ArgentinaÃ¢ÂÂs first chemotherapy patient. Today, of course, the pharmacopoeia includes multiple agents capable of shrinking tumors. Cervical cancers are now considered one of the more treatable malignancies, but not everywhere. In poor areas, where screening and treatment remain    for many women, itÃ¢ÂÂs still 1951. Kathleen Schmeler, a gynecologic oncologist at the MD Anderson Center, often works outside the bubble of modern medicine. In the border region of Texas, cervical cancer rates are 30 percent higher than the national average. In Mozambique, Schmeler found only one practicing medical oncologist in the entire country. Ã¢ÂÂShe told me no one wants to go into the oncology. Ã¢ÂÂThey say we just take care of the dead,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Schmeler said. Ã¢ÂÂI didnÃ¢ÂÂt live in that [earlier] era, but I feel like I still see it in these countries. Ã¢ÂÂ Most promising perhaps, are the vaccines that can keep people from contracting the   HPV viruses in the first place. If enough children are immunized Ã¢ÂÂ  something that hasnÃ¢ÂÂt happened yet Ã¢ÂÂ  doctors predict another plunge in the rates of cervical cancer in women and the   head and neck carcinomas that are the fastest growing cancers in men. And yes, those vaccines that could have spared Henrietta Lacks were developed from her own cells. Read more on Retropolis: She was attacked 50 years ago for being a woman in the Boston Marathon.

2286,"     Vice President Biden said in an interview broadcast Monday night that President Obama offered him financial help when his son Beau Biden was suffering from cancer. In the interview with CNN, the vice president said he had told Obama over one of their regular private lunches that if his son Beau were forced to step down his position as DelawareÃ¢ÂÂs attorney general and lose his income because of the brain cancer that ultimately killed him, the vice president and his wife Jill would have to sell their home to pay for BeauÃ¢ÂÂs medical expenses. He said Obama told him not to do that. Ã¢ÂÂHe said Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂll give you the money. Whatever you need, IÃ¢ÂÂll give you the money. DonÃ¢ÂÂt, Joe. Promise me. Promise me,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Biden told CNN.   [For all their political differences, Biden and Ryan share striking similarities]   Biden said that his son was worried he would have to resign if the cancer affected his cognitive abilities, and that it did affect his speech before he died. Biden had told Obama that if Beau resigned there would be Ã¢ÂÂnothing to fall back on.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂI said, Ã¢ÂÂBut I worked it out,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Biden recalled telling Obama.

The emotional toll of his sonÃ¢ÂÂs death on the vice president was one reason the elder Biden, 73, decided against running for president this year. The vice president said he would Ã¢ÂÂnever forgetÃ¢ÂÂ the eulogy Obama delivered at BeauÃ¢ÂÂs funeral.

2287," Kurt GodwinÃ¢ÂÂs obituaries in The Washington Post and on Legacy. com contained all the basics: He was the son of a CIA officer. He lived in Alexandria, Va. and was married. He taught art at Virginia Commonwealth and Catholic universities. He died Sept. 19, 2014, at the age of 58.  The cause of death was another matter. Ã¢ÂÂThe cause was cancer, said his wife, Karin Godwin,Ã¢ÂÂ the Post obituary noted. Ã¢ÂÂKurt Douglas Godwin passed away at INOVA Fairfax Hospital, due to stage 4 Cancer complications,Ã¢ÂÂ read a slightly more detailed death notice on Legacy. Godwin purposely withheld a salient fact: what kind of cancer. She didnÃ¢ÂÂt think her husband wanted others to know, she said. The same impulse was on display this month when rock legend David Bowie and actor Alan Rickman died of cancer and their families did not divulge the exact form of the disease in their announcements. Even in an era when cancer is discussed more openly and of   foundations, relatives of the ordinary and famous still omit the exact cause of death when it comes to the  .   Rock musician David Bowie passed away on Jan. 10, after a battle with cancer. The end to his influential,   career sparked hundreds of messages of grief and tribute. (Jenny   Washington Post)   Cancer will kill nearly 600, 000 Americans this year, according to the American Cancer Society. Experts say withholding the information about the type of cancer in obituaries only reinforces the diseaseÃ¢ÂÂs persistent stigma and can deprive researchers and advocates of opportunities to educate people about specific cancers and fundraise for their cures. Some relatives, though, say their loved ones would be embarrassed by disclosing which organ failed them, especially if the body part felt like too much information, or if it was the liver or lung, where cancers often originate because of smoking or drinking. Ã¢ÂÂThe cause was cancerÃ¢ÂÂ should suffice, they argue, because any more detail diverts attention from the personÃ¢ÂÂs life. Obituary writers at The Post and the New York Times estimate families resist naming specific cancers about 15 percent of the time. The news organizations typically ask for the type of cancer, particularly if the person who died was young, but an omission would never rule out an obituary. Ã¢ÂÂIf we push too much, it carries the risk of sounding to the family like we have a lurid obsession,Ã¢ÂÂ said Adam Bernstein, the PostÃ¢ÂÂs obituaries editor. Ã¢ÂÂBut Ã¢ÂÂcancerÃ¢ÂÂ is very general. ItÃ¢ÂÂs like saying someone died of a Ã¢ÂÂdisease.Ã¢ÂÂ Well, what kind of disease?Ã¢ÂÂ In the case of BowieÃ¢ÂÂs death on Jan. 11, it was announced on his official Facebook page that he died after a Ã¢ÂÂcourageous   battle with cancer. Ã¢ÂÂ Soon after, some of his fans began to wonder which cancer. Ã¢ÂÂI understand the value of privacy but now that we know that he was battling the cancer which ended his life after 18 months, the least David BowieÃ¢ÂÂs publicist can have the permission to do is disclose what type of cancer took BowieÃ¢ÂÂs life! !Ã¢ÂÂ wrote one fan, Richard Goldy. But GoldyÃ¢ÂÂs curiosity was not shared by other Bowie fans  Ã¢ÂÂ   his post only netted nine Facebook Ã¢ÂÂlikes. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂWhat does it matter what cancer he had? The man has battled it for 18 months and itÃ¢ÂÂs his and his familyÃ¢ÂÂs business not ours as fans. We donÃ¢ÂÂt need to know the details,Ã¢ÂÂ replied Jodie Riley Darlington, whose censure earned 688   from fellow Bowie fans. Days after BowieÃ¢ÂÂs death, some news outlets reported heÃ¢ÂÂd had liver cancer, based on a single source: his friend, the Belgian theater director Ivo van Hove, whose New York production of Ã¢ÂÂLazarusÃ¢ÂÂ featured the singerÃ¢ÂÂs music. According to Reuters, van Hove told Dutch NPO radio: Ã¢ÂÂHe told me more than a year and three months ago just after he had heard himself .Ã¢ÂÂ.Ã¢ÂÂ. he said it was liver cancer. Ã¢ÂÂ The purported revelation  Ã¢ÂÂ   never confirmed by BowieÃ¢ÂÂs family  Ã¢ÂÂ   set off a cycle of news stories around the world. Ã¢ÂÂDavid Bowie died of liver cancer, friend and collaborator says,Ã¢ÂÂ blared a New York Daily News headline. Ã¢ÂÂWhat could have David gone through during this horrible time? HereÃ¢ÂÂs five things to know,Ã¢ÂÂ read a story in Hollywoodlife. com, ticking off liver cancer symptoms and how liver cancer is diagnosed. When reached by The Post, however, van Hove recognized the sensitivity of his disclosure and tried to backtrack. Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt know if I can go into that. I am not a close friend, and I am not part of the family. I donÃ¢ÂÂt remember saying it. Perhaps I said it,Ã¢ÂÂ van Hove said. Ã¢ÂÂWhat I want to say officially was that it was cancer. I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to comment on liver cancer or brain tumors or whatever. I donÃ¢ÂÂt know. I donÃ¢ÂÂt know why that should be important at this moment. Ã¢ÂÂ Steve Martin, BowieÃ¢ÂÂs publicist, declined to comment. Richard Wender, the chief cancer control officer of the American Cancer Society, said when celebrities open up about their cancers, it can help educate people about getting colonoscopies or tests for hepatitis C.  Paul Goldberg, a District resident and novelist who runs a   Web publication called The Cancer Letter, cited Betty FordÃ¢ÂÂs divulgence in 1974 of her breast cancer diagnosis, which prompted women across the country to get mammograms. He also pointed to the more recent outpouring after Beau BidenÃ¢ÂÂs disclosure of his brain cancer, and how President Obama announced at his State of the Union address this month that Vice President Biden was now Ã¢ÂÂin charge of mission controlÃ¢ÂÂ for Ã¢ÂÂa new moonshotÃ¢ÂÂ to cure cancer. The disease exacts a nearly $75 billion toll in medical costs in the U. S.  Ã¢ÂÂAfter a lot of stagnation, now thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of money coming to cancer research. Look at whatÃ¢ÂÂs going to happen with the Ã¢ÂÂmoonshotÃ¢ÂÂ program,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. If ordinary families note the type of cancer their loved ones had in obituaries, then cancer patients can see how long someone lived since their diagnosis and perhaps find where they received treatment, Goldberg added. Ã¢ÂÂThe need for privacy is very personal, and you canÃ¢ÂÂt prescribe what the optimum amount of privacy is on something like this,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂThe argument for disclosing is that it makes people more aware of that disease and prompts them to think what can be done. Ã¢ÂÂ When Denise McQuighan died in March 2014 at the age of 55, Thomas McQuighan, a Maryland government contractor, made sure her obituary left out the exact kind of cancer. During her life, she only told two of her girlfriends that she had a combination of multiple myeloma and leukemia. She worried friends would treat her differently and had little interest in hearing anyone elseÃ¢ÂÂs   suggestions for treatments. Ã¢ÂÂThe cause of death was leukemia, but that leukemia came about from other therapies she had,Ã¢ÂÂ McQuighan said. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs an irrelevant question. She was a private person. What does the average person know about multiple myeloma? Nothing. Ã¢ÂÂ But when Bowie died, McQuighan immediately had questions: Ã¢ÂÂThe news said he had cancer, and I was like, Ã¢ÂÂWhich one?Ã¢ÂÂ But then I said, Ã¢ÂÂDoes it really matter?Ã¢ÂÂ If he had the same one my wife did, IÃ¢ÂÂd say, Ã¢ÂÂGee, I wish they had a cure for it.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Karin Godwin, a retired elementary art school teacher who lives in Alexandria, said her husband, Kurt, would have been happy with her decision to leave out his specific cancer in his obituary. He was always   about his colostomy bag and colon cancer diagnosis. Now that so much time has passed since his death in September 2014, she is comfortable speaking openly about his disease. Ã¢ÂÂHe didnÃ¢ÂÂt want everyone to know. It was a very embarrassing situation for him,Ã¢ÂÂ Godwin said. But when Bowie died earlier this month, Godwin, like McQuighan, said she instantly wanted to know the real truth. Which cancer claimed his life? Ã¢ÂÂI really did wonder. I have all his LPs,Ã¢ÂÂ Godwin said. Ã¢ÂÂI knew so much about Bowie, but theyÃ¢ÂÂre not going to tell how he died. ItÃ¢ÂÂs like thereÃ¢ÂÂs no closure to his life.

2288,"       Is a newly announced cancer therapy touted as Ã¢ÂÂunprecedentedÃ¢ÂÂ as   as itÃ¢ÂÂs said to be? ItÃ¢ÂÂs simply too soon to tell. At the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science on Sunday, Stanley Riddell, an immunotherapy researcher and oncologist at SeattleÃ¢ÂÂs Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, announced an exciting potential treatment. Ã¢ÂÂThe early data is unprecedented,Ã¢ÂÂ Riddell said during SundayÃ¢ÂÂs media conference in D. C. Riddell and his colleagues are working on immunotherapy. While chemotherapies attack tumors and cancer cells directly  Ã¢ÂÂ   usually causing significant damage to healthy tissues in the process  Ã¢ÂÂ   immunotherapy is about finding ways to help the human immune system fight off cancer cells the way it would attack foreign bacteria or a virus. Cancer cells are adept at outlasting or hiding from immune responses, so immunologists have to find ways to trigger the immune system to act out anyway.   [Cancer was killing her. She tried immunotherapy.]   Jill OÃ¢ÂÂ  chief executive of the Cancer Research Institute, said 2015 was Ã¢ÂÂa truly special year for cancer immunotherapyÃ¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ   and more than half of active clinical cancer trials use some form of it. With the White House set to fund a cancer Ã¢ÂÂmoonshotÃ¢ÂÂ to the tune of $1 billion, many are looking to immunotherapy as the best hope for a cure  Ã¢ÂÂ   or at least a much better treatment  Ã¢ÂÂ   for cancer.    Positron emission tomography (PET) images showing large tumor mass in the kidney prior to therapy that completely regressed on a repeat PET scan performed two months after. (Fred Hutch News Service)  According to Riddell, his teamÃ¢ÂÂs studies on a technique called adoptive T cell therapy are seeing stupendous results. In this process, doctors take white blood cells called T cells from cancer patients and genetically modify them, giving them tags that will help them to target specific cancer cells in the body. The doctors then allow these cells to multiply and reintroduce them into the body, providing patients with a   immune system tailored to fight the cancerous cells inside of them. In theory, these cells could keep protecting the body from cancerous invasions long after the initial treatment.   [Personalized cancer vaccines have already helped treat three patients]   The research is yet to be published, which means it hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been   (vouched for by scientists outside of the study) and is tough to evaluate. But the data Riddell is reporting is indeed impressive. In one study, the therapy eliminated all symptoms in 94 percent of participants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with other blood cancers showing response rates greater than 80 percent. More than half the subjects reportedly experienced complete remission. And these patients are ones who seemed sick beyond all hope. Ã¢ÂÂWe have very high rates of complete responses in patients that have failed all other conventional therapies, including bone marrow transplantation,Ã¢ÂÂ Riddell said during the briefing. But the BBC reports that seven of the patients had immune responses so severe they ended up in intensive care  Ã¢ÂÂ   and two of those patients died as a result. These risks are the biggest hurdle for immunotherapy to overcome. But even ignoring the potentially fatal   which Riddell hopes could be avoided by using lower doses of the therapy, the treatment has a long way to go before we can hail it as a   cure for cancer. For now, it has only been used to treat cancers of the blood. Not even the excited researchers behind the findings really think this will be a cancer Ã¢ÂÂcure.Ã¢ÂÂ What they hope is that their therapy can finally usher immunotherapy into the ranks of standard cancer treatment  Ã¢ÂÂ   something that could be used routinely alongside chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgical interventions. The team will keep working on ways to make their technique safer and more effective for all types of cancer. And when their results are formally published, other researchers can assess just how revolutionary the therapy truly is.

2289," ATLANTA  Ã¢ÂÂ   Jimmy Carter announced Sunday that he no longer needs treatment for cancer, less than seven months after revealing he had been diagnosed with melanoma that spread to his brain. Carter, 91, shared the news at one of his regular Sunday School classes at Maranatha Baptist Church in his hometown of Plains, Georgia. Carter always starts his lessons with a brief update on his recent activities. This week, Carter told the class, he received an MRI lasting more than 2 hours.  Ã¢ÂÂAnd then the doctors determined that I didnÃ¢ÂÂt need any more treatment,Ã¢ÂÂ Carter said in a video posted by  . Ã¢ÂÂSo IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to have any more treatment. Ã¢ÂÂ He smiled as the audience applauded. CarterÃ¢ÂÂs spokeswoman Deanna Congileo said in an email Sunday that his doctors will continue to perform scans to ensure cancer cells have not returned, and Carter will Ã¢ÂÂresume treatment if necessary. Ã¢ÂÂ A spokesman for Emory UniversityÃ¢ÂÂs Winship Cancer Institute, where Carter has been treated, declined to comment on Sunday, citing patient privacy. CarterÃ¢ÂÂs treatment plan for the aggressive form of cancer including a round of targeted radiation at several tumors on his brain and doses of an   drug every three weeks from August through February. The drug, Keytruda, was approved not long before CarterÃ¢ÂÂs announcement and helps his body seek out and destroy cancer cells. Medical experts have called Keytruda and similar immune therapy drugs Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ for patients with melanoma. But the drugs are relatively new, and doctors are still learning about how they should be used and for how long, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society. He is not involved in CarterÃ¢ÂÂs treatment.  Ã¢ÂÂSome people believe they should be continued as long as a patient is doing well, some feel the drugs should continue for a period of time and then be stopped,Ã¢ÂÂ Lichtenfeld said. Ã¢ÂÂThis is clearly a (decision) based on individual evidence specific to the president and made with his doctors. Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Douglas Johnson, a melanoma specialist at   Cancer Center who is not treating Carter, said the FDA did not provide a specific   for patients who see improvement while taking the drugs. Patients who see results may want to stop but battle with fear that the cancer could return, he said.  Ã¢ÂÂThat has become a very difficult question,Ã¢ÂÂ Johnson said. Ã¢ÂÂWe can say that patients who have stopped treatment have continued to do very well, but the drug has been around less than 10 years. Whether all patients have the same results, we donÃ¢ÂÂt know. Ã¢ÂÂ Carter made another unexpected announcement about his health at a December class, telling the audience that a recent scan of his brain detected no sign of cancer. At the time, Carter told the group that he planned to continue receiving doses of Keytruda every three weeks. He has said the drug caused few side effects. Jill Stuckey, a Maranatha Baptist Church member, said in a phone interview that CarterÃ¢ÂÂs updates have become Ã¢ÂÂa pattern for our church. Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂPresident Carter comes in, tells us phenomenal news and we all applaud,Ã¢ÂÂ Stuckey, also a close friend of the Carters, said. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre all on pins and needles wondering how things are going, because you never know from looking at somebody. Ã¢ÂÂ Carter has remained active throughout his treatment, including participating in a building project with Habitat for Humanity. He also continued work at the Carter Center, the human rights organization he founded after leaving the White House, contrary to his initial plans to step back during treatment. Tim Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation, said CarterÃ¢ÂÂs age or busy schedule may have been a factor in deciding to stop the treatment.  Ã¢ÂÂWhen you have a drug thatÃ¢ÂÂs working to keep cancer at bay, itÃ¢ÂÂs a hard decision to stop,Ã¢ÂÂ Turnham, who is not involved with CarterÃ¢ÂÂs treatment, said. Ã¢ÂÂIt really becomes a conversation between the patient and their doctor. Ã¢ÂÂ Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

2290,"     NEW ORLEANS    New immunotherapy drugs are showing significant and extended effectiveness against a broadening range of cancers, including rare and intractable tumors often caused by viruses. Researchers say these advances suggest the treatment approach is poised to become a critical part of the nationÃ¢ÂÂs   strategy. Scientists reported Tuesday that the medications, which marshal the bodyÃ¢ÂÂs own immune defenses, are now proving effective against    head and neck cancer and an extremely lethal skin cancer called Merkel cell carcinoma. Both can be caused by viruses as well as DNA mutations, and the drugs help the immune system to recognize the   cancer and attack it. Since pathogens are responsible for more than 20 percent of all cancers, Ã¢ÂÂthese results have implications that go far beyond a rare cancerÃ¢ÂÂ like Merkel cell carcinoma, said Paul Ngheim, an investigator with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle who led that study. The new data, plus research released Sunday that showed sharply higher survival rates among   patients who received immunotherapy, is prompting growing, albeit guarded, optimism among researchers attending the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting here. In addition to melanoma, the infusion drugs already have been approved for use against lung and kidney cancers.   [  survival rates increase for patients treated with immunotherapy]   Ã¢ÂÂWe are in the midst of a sea change in how we are treating cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ said Louis Weiner, director of the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, who wasnÃ¢ÂÂt involved in the studies. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre really seeing the fruits of many years of research into what drives cancer and how it interacts with the immune system to defeat it and survive.Ã¢ÂÂ The latest findings, as well as hundreds of ongoing clinical trials across the country, suggest that immunotherapy could be beneficial for more than two dozen kinds of cancer    and maybe many more. One of the most prominent patients is former president Jimmy Carter, who last year was diagnosed with advanced melanoma that had spread to his brain. He was treated with one of the new drugs, Keytruda, as well as radiation. The combination worked so well, causing his tumors to disappear, that he was able to stop treatment in March. Ã¢ÂÂWhatÃ¢ÂÂs happening to Jimmy Carter is happening to many, many people,Ã¢ÂÂ Weiner said. At the same time, however, researchers caution that they have a long way to go in fully understanding the therapy and transforming it into a viable treatment for a majority of patients. Ã¢ÂÂThis period for immunotherapy is comparable to the 1960s for chemotherapy, when we were just beginning to use it,Ã¢ÂÂ said Roy Jensen, director of the University of Kansas Cancer Center. Ã¢ÂÂThere is so much to do and to figure out. WeÃ¢ÂÂre just at the start of this.Ã¢ÂÂ Scientists donÃ¢ÂÂt know why some patients benefit from immunotherapy and others donÃ¢ÂÂt. In some trials, for example, less than a third of patients have had a positive response. Researchers think that proportion can be increased by combining these Ã¢ÂÂcheckpoint inhibitorÃ¢ÂÂ drugs    three have been approved by the government, with several more in development    or by adding conventional treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. Yet much work is needed on how exactly to do that and on how to better comprehend cancerÃ¢ÂÂs wide range of defenses. The research successes are emerging just as the Obama administration, as well as private philanthropists, focus on ways to radically accelerate progress against cancer. Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and tech billionaire Sean Parker have announced that they will invest hundreds of millions of dollars in immunotherapy research. On Wednesday, Vice President Biden will address the conference about the Obama administrationÃ¢ÂÂs   Ã¢ÂÂmoonshotÃ¢ÂÂ initiative.   [Cancer experts named to advise Obama administration on Ã¢ÂÂmoonshotÃ¢ÂÂ effort]   Head and neck cancer, a devastating disease that affects the patientÃ¢ÂÂs ability to eat, breathe and talk, can be caused by the human papillomavirus, or HPV. Data released as an abstract Tuesday showed the immunotherapy drug Opdivo led to improved overall survival for patients with advanced cancer who had not responded to chemotherapy. Such benefit had not been seen before, according to Maura Gillison of the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, who led the study. The scientists divided 361 patients into two groups: One got Opdivo, and the other received chemotherapy selected by individual researchers. At the end of a year, 36 percent of the Opdivo patients were still alive, compared to 17 percent of the chemotherapy group. The immunotherapy drug was beneficial regardless of whether a patient had been infected with HPV. Gillison said she hoped that the results would establish Opdivo Ã¢ÂÂas a new standard of care option for this patient population and thereby fulfill a huge unmet need.Ã¢ÂÂ With Merkel cell carcinoma, which almost always kills quickly, many more cases are triggered by a common virus than by exposure to ultraviolet light. And in the trial, slightly more than half of the 25   patients had a significant reduction in their tumors. The drug prompted the immune system Ã¢ÂÂto get up out of its rocking chairÃ¢ÂÂ and go attack the cancer, Ngheim said. More than 80 percent of the patients who responded are still experiencing Ã¢ÂÂexcellent disease controlÃ¢ÂÂ six months after starting treatment, and several patients have no sign of disease, he added. The study was published online Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. Suzanne Topalian, a   of the study and associate director of Johns HopkinsÃ¢ÂÂ new   Institute for Cancer Immunology, said the results provide an Ã¢ÂÂopen doorÃ¢ÂÂ for considering immunotherapy for other cancers caused by viruses.    Stan Collender receives an immunotherapy drug as part of his treatment for rare Merkel cell carcinoma. (Robert   Hutch News Service)  Stan Collender, a   Washington budget expert and public relations executive, was facing the typically dire prognosis when he was diagnosed with Merkel cell carcinoma in 2012. He had three recurrences, with tumors under his chin and in his brain and chest. Ã¢ÂÂI was convinced I was going to die,Ã¢ÂÂ he recalled recently. Then in 2015, Collender became one of the patients enrolled in NghiemÃ¢ÂÂs trial. Last spring, he began flying to Seattle every three weeks to get a   infusion of Keytruda. A few months later, the doctors got the first scans of his body and brain. His oncologist at Hutchinson texted him the news: Ã¢ÂÂYour scans look fantastic. ..Ã¢ÂÂ That was almost 10 months ago, and the    Collender said he now feels Ã¢ÂÂmiraculously well.Ã¢ÂÂ He has gone Ã¢ÂÂfrom not being able to stop thinking about my cancer to not thinking about it at all.Ã¢ÂÂ Collender is hoping the benefit will last.

2291,"     It was clear from the first paragraph that this wasnÃ¢ÂÂt your typical consumer report. Ã¢ÂÂI write this from the hospital,Ã¢ÂÂ John Stossel of Fox wrote. Ã¢ÂÂSeems I have lung cancer. Ã¢ÂÂ This was quite the revelation  Ã¢ÂÂ   one all the more powerful for its delivery in terse,   prose. But Stossel, who said he Ã¢ÂÂwill barely notice that a fifth of my lung is goneÃ¢ÂÂ and that he will Ã¢ÂÂbe fine,Ã¢ÂÂ wasnÃ¢ÂÂt here for a meditation on mortality a la Oliver Sacks. Instead, from the highly regarded New   Hospital, the    consumer affairs reporter quickly transitioned into a discussion of why his Ã¢ÂÂhospitalÃ¢ÂÂs customer service stinks. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂMy doctors tell me my growth was caught early and IÃ¢ÂÂll be fine,Ã¢ÂÂ he wrote. Ã¢ÂÂSoon I will barely notice that a fifth of my lung is gone. I believe them. After all, IÃ¢ÂÂm at New   Hospital. U. S. News & World Report ranked it No. 1 in New York. I get excellent medical care here. Ã¢ÂÂBut as a consumer reporter, I have to say, the hospitalÃ¢ÂÂs customer service stinks. Doctors keep me waiting for hours, and no one bothers to call or email to say, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm running late.Ã¢ÂÂ Few doctors give out their email address. Patients canÃ¢ÂÂt communicate using modern technology. Ã¢ÂÂI get   EKG tests, echocardiograms, blood tests. Are all needed? I doubt it. But no one discusses that with me or mentions the cost. Why would they? The patient rarely pays directly. Government or insurance companies pay. Ã¢ÂÂ   [Video: This app allows unhappy patients to request refunds]   Ã¢ÂÂCustomer service is sclerotic because hospitals are largely socialist bureaucracies,Ã¢ÂÂ Stossel added. Ã¢ÂÂInstead of answering to consumers, which forces businesses to be nimble, hospitals report to government, lawyers and insurance companies. Ã¢ÂÂ StosselÃ¢ÂÂs opinion wasnÃ¢ÂÂt a surprise  Ã¢ÂÂ   heÃ¢ÂÂs known for his libertarian critiques of everything from school vouchers to pornography to euthanasia. Ã¢ÂÂGovernment Ã¢ÂÂhelpÃ¢ÂÂ encourages poor people to be dependent and passive,Ã¢ÂÂ he wrote last year. Ã¢ÂÂDependent, people stay poor. Also, most government handouts donÃ¢ÂÂt even go to the poor. They go to the middle class (college loans, big mortgage tax deductions, Medicare) and the rich (corporate welfare, bailouts to banks Ã¢ÂÂtoo big to failÃ¢ÂÂ). Instead of making government more powerful, letÃ¢ÂÂs get rid of those handouts. Left and right ought to agree on that. Ã¢ÂÂ But the widely shared Fox piece, in which Stossel praised nurses but criticized hospitalsÃ¢ÂÂ endless forms, antiquated machinery, ambiguity about costs and necessary fear of lawsuits, seemed to crystallize the problems with American health care for many. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂve been a hospital nurse for >30 yrs and patient a number of times,Ã¢ÂÂ one commenter on StosselÃ¢ÂÂs Facebook page wrote. Ã¢ÂÂAlways frustrated by having to repeat the same info on paper forms. Since [the Affordable Health Care Act] I have a high deductible plan and all the care I get comes out of my pocket. I find it extremely difficult to enter into a market negotiation for price or even find out what a cost will be before I get the services. Govt has distorted our system that I donÃ¢ÂÂt think I will will ever see a return to market forces in my lifetime. Ã¢ÂÂ Known for his love of University of Chicago economist and   guru Milton Friedman, Stossel has also faced charges that his reporting is inaccurate and biased. In 2013, for example, the liberal media watchdog Media Matters criticized a video series called Ã¢ÂÂStossel in the ClassroomÃ¢ÂÂ it said was funded by   donors. Ã¢ÂÂThe program now offers hundreds of free clips from StosselÃ¢ÂÂs shows and specials that claim to seriously address a range of academic subjects, including Art (Ã¢ÂÂWhy does Hollywood Hate Capitalism? Ã¢ÂÂ) Biology (Ã¢ÂÂDebunking Food MythsÃ¢ÂÂ) and History (Ã¢ÂÂThe Real Story of Thanksgiving,Ã¢ÂÂ which explains Ã¢ÂÂhow the Pilgrims were hurt by sharingÃ¢ÂÂ),Ã¢ÂÂ it wrote. StosselÃ¢ÂÂs criticism of his hospital stay, however, didnÃ¢ÂÂt demand a deep understanding of Austrian economics or a love of the Koch brothers. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm as happy as the next guy to have government or my insurance company pay, but the result is that thereÃ¢ÂÂs practically no free market,Ã¢ÂÂ he wrote. Ã¢ÂÂMarkets work when buyer and seller deal directly with each other. That doesnÃ¢ÂÂt happen in hospitals. Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,FoxÃ¢ÂÂs John Stossel: Ã¢ÂÂI write this from the hospital.

2292,"         DALLAS  In 2014, Diana visited our genetics clinic in Texas. She was only in her early 40s, but her mother had died of breast cancer at 42, and two of her aunts had received the same diagnosis at young ages. As we tested her for a panel of breast cancer gene mutations, she joked about her Irish heritage, of which she was clearly proud. But we discovered that Diana carried an Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA1 mutation that predisposed her to breast and ovarian cancer. During World War II, it turned out, her French Jewish family converted to Catholicism and made Ireland their home. Nobody had told her. The secrecy was understandable. But as an oncologist, I know it can carry major risks. One of the most important things I need to learn about my patients is their family medical history. Many illnesses  Ã¢ÂÂ   from diabetes and asthma to heart disease and dementia  Ã¢ÂÂ   are at least partly hereditary. One recent study found that 33 percent of cancer diagnoses can be explained by genes. Alcoholism is as much as 60 percent genetic; schizophrenia occurs in less than 1 percent of the general population but in 10 percent of people who have a sibling or parent with the disorder. Ã¢ÂÂWhat happens in your family is an approximation of what happens to you,Ã¢ÂÂ geneticist Joe Nadeau told New York magazine. Ã¢ÂÂThe conventional family history is still the best predictor of disease risk. Ã¢ÂÂ For many patients, sharing this information could save their lives. If a patientÃ¢ÂÂs family is peppered with alcoholics, I might advise him or her to avoid liquor. If a patientÃ¢ÂÂs relatives have suffered from colon cancer, IÃ¢ÂÂd know to look for gene mutations and prescribe frequent colonoscopies.  But few of us have an accurate understanding of what came before us,  . Only   of Americans have ever tried to collect their family medical histories from relatives. And even when they do, they can run into major problems. You probably know less than you think about your familyÃ¢ÂÂs predispositions. Part of that is the fault of the medical profession. Doctors spend very little time  Ã¢ÂÂ   just 15 minutes, in a lot of cases  Ã¢ÂÂ   with patients. We simply canÃ¢ÂÂt afford to construct a family tree. One study found that physicians devote just three minutes to asking   questions during a patientÃ¢ÂÂs first visit. Even when doctors ask, they may not get the right answers. Many patients donÃ¢ÂÂt really know their familiesÃ¢ÂÂ health histories. In some instances, relatives might never have revealed that they were sick, particularly if they struggled with a disease that carries a stigma. According to one study, 58 percent of psychiatrists said they wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt tell family and friends if they suffered from a mental illness. Cancer advocate Doug Ulman wrote that heÃ¢ÂÂs known many people to keep their illness under wraps because of Ã¢ÂÂfear, ostracism and shame. Ã¢ÂÂ IÃ¢ÂÂve seen this in my family, too. My    mother loves to talk about her fatherÃ¢ÂÂs daily visits to speakeasies and his 1931 imprisonment for drunken driving. But she would never describe him as an alcoholic.  Other times, patients are aware of only the outlines of their familiesÃ¢ÂÂ medical histories, or they interpret them incorrectly. One person visiting our genetics clinic denied that he had a family history of cancer because, he said, nobody had died. Another suggested that her sisterÃ¢ÂÂs breast cancer at age 38 was due to her divorce. One even told me her father had only Ã¢ÂÂa touch of melanoma. Ã¢ÂÂ And when we can look back at family records, we might not understand what weÃ¢ÂÂre reading. It wasnÃ¢ÂÂt so long ago that tuberculosis was known as Ã¢ÂÂconsumptionÃ¢ÂÂ and epilepsy was Ã¢ÂÂfalling sickness. Ã¢ÂÂ Strokes were Ã¢ÂÂapoplexy,Ã¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂbad bloodÃ¢ÂÂ was code for syphilis. Studies show just how widespread this problem is. In one study, researchers asked more than 1, 000 people about cancers in their relatives and then checked those responses against information in registries, Medicare databases, death certificates and other health records.   of the histories that patients reported had errors. Even with official health documents or family stories, we need to remain skeptical. Mistakes in records happen. And memory is not a factual accounting of past events but a construction of what we think happened. Lung cancer may have, in fact, been colon cancer; ovarian cancer perhaps was cervical cancer. This matters because different types of cancers put patients at risk for different kinds of diseases.  I had a colon cancer patient who was adopted at birth. Before starting a family, he wanted to learn more about his biological parents and their health histories. As a psychiatrist, he was concerned about mental disorders that have a hereditary component, such as schizophrenia. After much work with an adoption disclosure agency, he met his birth parents. He learned that they had been unmarried when he was born. He asked his biological parents about mental illnesses. None, he was assured. He didnÃ¢ÂÂt think to ask about cancer. He and his wife had two children. Then, at 42, he was diagnosed with colon cancer. He contacted his biological mother to let her know. She wasnÃ¢ÂÂt surprised. You should know, she told him, that others in the family had suffered from the same disease. When he pressed, he found out that Ã¢ÂÂothersÃ¢ÂÂ also included secret siblings. His biological parents had told him only about siblings who were born after they married. They hadnÃ¢ÂÂt shared the medical histories of the other children who had also been given up for adoption. Eventually, he met the rest of the family. One of his siblings was about to cancel her regular colonoscopy when she learned about the colon cancer in her newly discovered brother. She kept the date, and the gastroenterologist discovered polyps, a precursor to colon cancer. The polyps were removed, and her life was most likely saved. ItÃ¢ÂÂs rarely easy to learn about your familyÃ¢ÂÂs health history, but itÃ¢ÂÂs worth doing your research. (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health have online guides to help people get started.) Knowing what you know  Ã¢ÂÂ   and donÃ¢ÂÂt  Ã¢ÂÂ   about your familyÃ¢ÂÂs medical history is one of the most important tools there is to save lives in predictable and, more often than not, unpredictable ways.  outlook@washpost. com   Read more from Outlook and follow our updates on Facebook and Twitter.

2293,"     Joe ScholtenÃ¢ÂÂs sister had already beaten breast cancer and was battling ovarian cancer when she tested positive for a genetic mutation linked to both. He responded by doing something unusual: He got tested, too. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs how the District resident discovered that he also carried the defective BRCA gene. He quickly told his brothers, other relatives and, hardest of all, his daughter. Ã¢ÂÂGetting tested was a Ã¢ÂÂ he said, wondering what steps his sister would have taken if sheÃ¢ÂÂd learned early on about her own genetic risk. She was 54 when the ovarian cancer killed her. He realizes now that not knowing your medical pedigree is Ã¢ÂÂclearly a danger. Ã¢ÂÂ Yet ScholtenÃ¢ÂÂs action makes him an outlier. Many women are acutely aware of the stark dangers posed by mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes  Ã¢ÂÂ   the kind that prompted actress Angelina Jolie to have her breasts and ovaries removed preemptively. Few men, however, know that the same genetic defects can have deadly consequences for them as well as their children. [New immunotherapy drugs hold promise for treating a variety of cancers] New research could prompt a major rethinking. BRCA mutations were already linked to prostate cancer, and a growing body of studies suggests they might play an even bigger role than early findings indicated. Men with these mutations are more likely than   to contract aggressive, lethal prostate cancer, to be diagnosed at a more advanced stage and to ultimately die of the disease, researchers say. Just last week, a new analysis showed that men with BRCA2 mutations had a higher rate of   prostate cancer at the time of diagnosis and worse outcomes. Ã¢ÂÂWe are only just beginning to truly understand how these genes could impact a manÃ¢ÂÂs risk,Ã¢ÂÂ said Brian Helfand, a urologic oncologist with NorthShore University HealthSystem in Evanston, Ill.   [What men need to know about the Angelina Jolie Ã¢ÂÂ  geneÃ¢ÂÂ]   The latest studies suggest that a manÃ¢ÂÂs BRCA status can be an important piece of information, especially at a time when many doctors are taking a less aggressive stance in screening and treating prostate cancer. The two genes produce proteins that help repair damaged DNA, and alterations in either diminish the bodyÃ¢ÂÂs defense against cancer. Besides being linked to breast, ovarian and prostate cancers, BRCA defects have been implicated in melanoma and pancreatic cancer. If a parent has the mutation, a child has a 50 percent chance of inheriting it. Although many people who have these mutations wonÃ¢ÂÂt ever get cancer, the risks are still much higher. They differ by individual cases, race and gender.   [Five daunting things you need to know about ovarian cancer]   An estimated 12 percent of women will develop breast cancer during their lifetimes, according to the National Cancer Institute. That proportion rises to as high as 65 percent of women who inherit a BRCA1 mutation and about 45 percent for those with a BRCA2 defect. Almost 40 percent of women with a BRCA1 mutation and up to 17 percent with a BRCA2 defect will get ovarian cancer. MenÃ¢ÂÂs risk of getting breast cancer, generally one in 1, 000, rises to about 7 percent for BRCA2 mutation carriers. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂsignificantly elevated,Ã¢ÂÂ said Marc Schwartz,   of the cancer prevention and control program at the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center. A BRCA1 mutation also appears to increase the risk, but itÃ¢ÂÂs not clear by how much. As for prostate cancer, the analysis presented last week at an American Urological Association meeting found that 17 percent of patients with BRCA2 mutations already had advanced disease, four times the rate of patients without the mutation. In a study on African American men, researchers at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center examined more than 850 archived blood samples and found that blacks were more likely than whites to have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, as well as more aggressive disease.   [When the oncologist has the Ã¢ÂÂbreast cancer geneÃ¢ÂÂ]   Ã¢ÂÂThe problem is, everyone associates this with women and their cancers,Ã¢ÂÂ said Bruce Montgomery, an oncologist at the Seattle Cancer Care   of Washington Medical Center. Ã¢ÂÂIn menÃ¢ÂÂs minds, BRCA is about breast cancer, so they donÃ¢ÂÂt see it as relevant. Ã¢ÂÂ Bill Rotter, 63, of Mequon, Wis. wishes he had known earlier about his BRCA2 mutation. He probably wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt have ignored the   lump he discovered next to his right nipple in late 2013. When he finally had a mammogram, ultrasound and then biopsy, invasive ductal carcinoma was found, making him one of about 2, 200 American men diagnosed with breast cancer each year. About 400 die of the disease annually. Rotter had a mastectomy on his right side and a second surgery a few weeks later to remove 13 lymph nodes because the cancer had appeared in a Ã¢ÂÂsentinelÃ¢ÂÂ node. Chemotherapy and radiation followed. He learned of his genetic mutation in between the two surgeries and wonders if earlier action could have prevented the disease from spreading.    Bill Rotter only learned he had a BRCA genetic mutation after being diagnosed with breast cancer. He underwent a mastectomy and now urges other men to find out if theyÃ¢ÂÂre at risk. (Darren Hauck for the Washington Post)  In retrospect, he said, the finding shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt have been a surprise: His father died of prostate cancer at 64, and two of his fatherÃ¢ÂÂs brothers also died of the disease. A male first cousin he had never met died of breast cancer in his 30s. Plus, his familyÃ¢ÂÂs Ashkenazi Jewish heritage increases the chance of being a mutation carrier by tenfold. [  survival rates double for melanoma patients getting immunotherapy]  The father of two sons is now what Boston College sociologist Sharlene   calls a Ã¢ÂÂBRCA warrior,Ã¢ÂÂ one of a small group of men determined to alert others to the dangers of inherited genetic defects. Ã¢ÂÂMy passion is to create awareness about the genetic component of cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ said Rotter, who writes occasional blog posts for Ambry Genetics, a company that offers testing. Ã¢ÂÂIt is amazing how many people, even in the field of medicine, have no clue. Ã¢ÂÂ BRCA mutations have testing and treatment implications for men, who, for starters, should be screened for prostate cancer starting at age 40, according to Theodora Ross, director of the cancer genetics program at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. In addition, drugs called PARP inhibitors, which have been shown to benefit some ovarian cancer patients with BRCA mutations, may be of use for prostate cancer patients with the gene defects. But if men embrace more genetic testing, theyÃ¢ÂÂll inevitably face the kind of questions women have been dealing with for years. Not all families want to discuss their health risks, as Vincent Moltisanti of Staten Island realized when his breast cancer was diagnosed in 2005. He put together a family medical history  Ã¢ÂÂ   no easy task  Ã¢ÂÂ   and underwent genetic counseling. Ã¢ÂÂIn Italian families, no one gives out information about their health; itÃ¢ÂÂs on a    basis,Ã¢ÂÂ said Moltisanti, who is now 68. Ã¢ÂÂYou have to kind of guess what your great aunts and uncles had and what caused their demise. Ã¢ÂÂ When testing showed he had a BRCA mutation, his daughter, Jaime, was tested and told she was positive as well. She planned to have her breasts and ovaries removed at some point but died of lung cancer in 2014. Moltisanti urged his two older brothers to take action. Neither was interested. Ã¢ÂÂYouÃ¢ÂÂd think they would want to know,Ã¢ÂÂ the retired longshoreman said, adding that he worries not only about both of them but about his nieces and nephews and their children. Scholten understands the risks of family secrets. His sister, a lawyer who lived in Alabama, contracted breast cancer in the early 2000s but kept it to herself because their mother had dementia and she didnÃ¢ÂÂt want to upset her. She didnÃ¢ÂÂt know that a male cousin had died of breast cancer. If her doctors had known about their cousin, maybe they would have ordered testing much earlier, Scholten said. As it happened, his sister didnÃ¢ÂÂt undergo testing until after her ovarian cancer was diagnosed. Ã¢ÂÂThe dots,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, Ã¢ÂÂdidnÃ¢ÂÂt get connected.

2294,"     People with cancer that starts on the left side of their colon live significantly longer than those with   tumors, according to a new study that provides insights into how best to match drugs to patients with advanced disease. The retrospective analysis, released Wednesday, involved a federally funded clinical trial with more than 1, 100   patients. Overall, it found that those with   tumors survived for a median of 33. 3  months, while those with   tumors survived for 19. 4 months. Lead author Alan Venook, a professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco, said previous studies had suggested tumor location played a role in patientsÃ¢ÂÂ survival, but the effect shown by the new study was greater than he expected.   [HereÃ¢ÂÂs what men need to know about the Angelina Jolie Ã¢ÂÂ  geneÃ¢ÂÂ]   The data also turned up a striking difference in drug efficacy depending on the location of the tumors. Two therapies were used in the trial, in combination with chemotherapy, to see whether one worked better than the other. The answer was no based on initial results. But when the data was evaluated based on a tumorÃ¢ÂÂs location, things changed. Avastin was associated with longer survival times in cases of   tumors, while Erbitux was linked to longer survival with   malignancies. Specifically, patients with   tumors who were given Avastin survived for 24. 2 months compared to 16. 7 months for those treated with Erbitux. Patients with   tumors treated with Erbitux survived 36 months compared to 31. 4 months for those treated with Avastin. Venook said researchers now are looking for the underlying biological reasons for these findings. He noted that the left and right sides of the colon arise from different embryonic tissues and have different characteristics. Ã¢ÂÂAre there more bad actors on the right side?Ã¢ÂÂ he said, adding that the difference between   and   tumors could be Ã¢ÂÂa surrogate for some  Ã¢ÂÂ that scientists have yet to find.   [How this financial counselor saves patients from the toxic effects of high drug prices.]   Richard Kim, an associate professor in the department of gastrointestinal oncology at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, said he wasnÃ¢ÂÂt surprised by the results because earlier studies had pointed to similar, if less definitive, conclusions. But Kim, who wasnÃ¢ÂÂt involved in the latest research, said it was still important because it retrospectively analyzed such a large group of patients. The findings underscore how different the two sides of the colon are and how tumors likely need to be treated differently depending on their location. Once the molecular reasons for that are determined, he said, physicians can apply the information in their choice of cancer drugs. The colon, also called the large intestine, is a strong, long muscle critical for the last phase of digestion. Its right side includes the cecum and the ascending colon, while the left side is made up of the descending colon, the sigmoid colon and the rectum.   [Defective Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ genes are dangerous for men as well as women.]   Venook said that the results might not apply to patients who didnÃ¢ÂÂt have advanced cancer. The findings will be presented as an abstract at the American Society of Clinical Oncology next month.

2295,"     CHICAGO  Ã¢ÂÂ   Researchers said extending hormone therapy to 10 years reduces the risk of a recurrence of breast cancer in many older women and decreases the chance of a new cancer emerging in the other, healthy breast. The study, which was released Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, involved   women who had a type of   breast cancer known as hormone  . That means the cancer was driven by estrogen, progesterone or both.  The data showed that women benefited from taking the drug letrozole, part of a class of   called aromatase inhibitors, for 10 years. Typically, that kind of drug is taken for five years, sometimes after a course of another hormone therapy, tamoxifen. While many women with   breast cancer live for a long time, they Ã¢ÂÂface an indefinite risk of relapse,Ã¢ÂÂ said the studyÃ¢ÂÂs lead author, Paul Goss, director of breast cancer research at Massachusetts General Hospital. He said the new research Ã¢ÂÂprovides direction for many patients and their doctors, confirming that prolonging aromatase inhibitor therapy can further reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrences.Ã¢ÂÂ     [Large study of Ã¢ÂÂliquid biopsiesÃ¢ÂÂ shows promise of being alternative to traditional biopsies]   However, women who were treated with the drug for a total 10 years didnÃ¢ÂÂt live longer than those who were given a placebo in the study. Goss said at a news briefing on Sunday that heÃ¢ÂÂs confident a survival benefit will emerge in the data in coming years.   The results of the study were published online in the New England Journal of Medicine, which also featured an editorial calling the study Ã¢ÂÂreassuringÃ¢ÂÂ and saying that Ã¢ÂÂthe findings have direct application for clinical practice.Ã¢ÂÂ  But some experts were cautious about predicting changes in treatment strategies. Letrozole has side effects, and the women who took it for a prolonged period as part of the study suffered more bone pain, fractures and the onset of osteoporosis compared with the women who didnÃ¢ÂÂt get the drug.    [HereÃ¢ÂÂs what men need to know about the Ã¢ÂÂ  geneÃ¢ÂÂ]   Those side effects, as well as the absence of a survival benefit, means doctors and patients will have to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of taking an aromatase inhibitor for a decade, said J. Leonard Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society who wasnÃ¢ÂÂt involved in the research. The study itself, he said, does not offer Ã¢ÂÂas clear a result as one might like.Ã¢ÂÂ Claudine Isaacs, a medical oncologist at Georgetown UniversityÃ¢ÂÂs Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, said the data was   by clinicians who wondered whether prolonged treatment with aromatase inhibitors would be beneficial and safe for patients. Ã¢ÂÂThis gives us data to take back to the clinic to talk to our patients about,Ã¢ÂÂ said Isaacs, who led LombardiÃ¢ÂÂs participation in the study. Ã¢ÂÂIf I had a patient who doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have side effects from this therapy and has a higher risk of recurrence, IÃ¢ÂÂd consider extending it  Ã¢ÂÂ   or at least having an informed discussion with her. Ã¢ÂÂ The study enrolled 1, 918 postmenopausal women in the randomized Phase 3 trial. All had taken letrozole for about 5 years; some also had been treated previously with tamoxifen. Half of the women were given a daily pill of letrozole for an additional 5 years, while the rest were put on a placebo. At a   followup, a total of 165 women had experienced a recurrence of breast cancer or developed a new cancer in the opposite breast. Of those, 67 were in the letrozole group while 98 were in the placebo group. That meant the risk of disease recurrence and new cancer was 34 percent lower among women who continued the aromatase inhibitor for 10 years compared with the other group, researchers said. Looked at another way, 95 percent of the women in the letrozole group experienced   survival for five years, compared with 91 percent in the placebo group.   [Immunotherapy boosts   survival for melanoma patients]   Currently, when older women develop breast cancer, they are prescribed a variety of regimens to reduce the possibility of recurrence, including taking tamoxifen for five or 10 years, some combination of tamoxifen and an aromatase inhibitor, or an aromatase inhibitor alone for five years.   Clinicians knew from previous studies that using tamoxifen for up to 10 years was better than using it for five years, but there wasnÃ¢ÂÂt corresponding data for aromatase inhibitors. Harold Burstein, a medical oncologist at   Cancer Institute and a spokesman for the oncologistsÃ¢ÂÂ group, acknowledged that Ã¢ÂÂ10 years of any therapy is a long time. Ã¢ÂÂ But he said he expected there to be Ã¢ÂÂtremendous interestÃ¢ÂÂ in the study.

2297,"     Doctors have long known that many   breast cancer patients who undergo chemotherapy donÃ¢ÂÂt actually need it to prevent recurrence of the disease after surgery. But they havenÃ¢ÂÂt known exactly which patients might safely skip the toxic treatment. A European study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine sheds new light on the issue, concluding that many such patients might be able to avoid chemo. The key factor: Nearly half of the patients considered at high risk for recurrence might actually be low risk based on genetic factors, researchers found. The study involved almost 6, 700 patients with localized breast cancer that hadnÃ¢ÂÂt spread beyond three lymph nodes. Of those, about half were considered high risk based on clinical measures such as tumor size and patient age. Typically, all would have considered chemotherapy as part of their treatment. But a   test called MammaPrint found that about 1, 500 of that group were low risk based on genomic factors. They were considered Ã¢ÂÂdiscordantÃ¢ÂÂ      patients based on clinical factors, but low risk based on   results.   [IVF doesnÃ¢ÂÂt increase chance of getting breast cancer, according to study]   The 1, 500 women then were randomly assigned to two groups, with one getting chemo and one not getting it. After five years, the survival rates of the groups were similar    just 1. 5 percentage points higher for the women whoÃ¢ÂÂd received chemo. The survival rate for the   group was close to 95 percent. Given those findings, the researchers say, about 46 percent of women with breast cancer who are classified as high risk based on clinical factors might not need chemo. Study   Laura van Ã¢ÂÂt Veer, a molecular biologist and leader of the breast oncology program at the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of California at San Francisco, did the research that led to the gene test while working for the Netherlands Cancer Institute. Van Ã¢ÂÂt Veer, who is an officer in the company now marketing the test, said MammaPrint Ã¢ÂÂlooks under the hood of the tumor and into the engine of the cancer to show whether the biology is truly aggressive and has capacity to invade surrounding tissue.Ã¢ÂÂ     [Prolonging   therapy reduces   recurrence]   She said the 1. 5   difference in survival rates between women who got chemo and the ones who didnÃ¢ÂÂt was not statistically significant, especially considering the side effects of chemo, which can include fatigue, cognitive impairment and a prolonged disruption in schedule. But Paul Kelly Marcom, a breast cancer oncologist at Duke Cancer Institute, said that whether that   difference is significant is a personal decision by a woman and her doctor. He also noted that there are other genomic tests on the market and that physicians are in the early stages of learning how to use them. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs not a quick or easy process,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, adding that he thinks physicians need more data before making big changes in clinical practice. Another test, called Oncotype DX, came on the U. S. market earlier and is more widely used. But it analyzes a smaller set of genes than MammaPrint and is used for only certain types of breast cancer. Both Oncotype DX and MammaPrint cost about $4, 000. In many cases, Marcom said, insurance covers the tests. An accompanying editorial in the journal said the trial showed Ã¢ÂÂhow a   and highly collaborative multinational team of investigators can efficiently conduct a potentially   study.Ã¢ÂÂ It said the results Ã¢ÂÂcould allow some doctors and patients to choose to avoid chemotherapy if they have carefully considered their own tolerance for toxicity, risk, and uncertainty.Ã¢ÂÂ Yet such decisions are Ã¢ÂÂhighly individualized.Ã¢ÂÂ The European study was called MINDACT for Microarray for   Disease May Avoid Chemotherapy Trial. Some of the information was released in April at the American Association for Cancer Research annual conference. Read more: Merck   parents on HPV vaccine.

2298,"      Bald but beaming,    Eden Oyelola yanked the long rope to ring the Ã¢ÂÂvictory bellÃ¢ÂÂ at ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs National Medical Center last September. She was finally done with her treatment for brain cancer  Ã¢ÂÂ   surgery followed by months of radiation and chemotherapy that made her terribly ill. At a Ã¢ÂÂbell partyÃ¢ÂÂ at her home in Upper Marlboro, Md. later that week, she gobbled down ice cream with friends and rode a pony around the back yard. Her parents exhaled in relief. Ã¢ÂÂWe thought she was in the clear,Ã¢ÂÂ her father said. The relief was  . In January, the little girl who loved gymnastics started having seizures and losing control of her left side. She frequently stumbled. Ã¢ÂÂWhatÃ¢ÂÂs wrong with my legs?Ã¢ÂÂ she asked. A second surgery followed after an MRI showed that the tumor had returned, forcing her doctors at ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs to ask whether there was anything else that would give Eden a chance to survive.  The team ultimately turned to the hottest field in medicine and a new class of drugs that has had stunning success in some adults, including former president Jimmy Carter, with even    malignancies. Growing ranks of pediatric oncologists are considering immunotherapy and Ã¢ÂÂcheckpoint inhibitorsÃ¢ÂÂ to try to save desperately ill children.  But young patients with cancer present a special challenge. Research can seem more dangerous because of their age, and drugs that work in adults may fail for the same reason. No one can yet say with certainty whether  Ã¢ÂÂ   or to what degree  Ã¢ÂÂ   these treatments hold equal promise for children. That allows for hope as well as, in EdenÃ¢ÂÂs case, devastating disappointment. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs a new horizon that we need to explore and see if it can help these kids,Ã¢ÂÂ said Brian Rood, EdenÃ¢ÂÂs  . Ã¢ÂÂBut weÃ¢ÂÂre still learning how to use it. Ã¢ÂÂ   [Immunotherapy shows promise in a growing list of cancers]   Immunotherapy, which one specialist calls Ã¢ÂÂthe fourth pillar of cancer treatmentÃ¢ÂÂ after surgery, radiation and chemo, marshals the bodyÃ¢ÂÂs immune system to fight a malignancy. As part of that approach, checkpoint inhibitors disrupt a cloaking device tumors wield to evade and suppress T cells, the foot soldiers of the immune system. Once T cells can see the cancer, they attack it just as they would other foreign intruders such as bacteria.    Four checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for adults, but they are only now undergoing broader testing in children. The lag reflects the many significant hurdles of conducting clinical trials with this age group. EdenÃ¢ÂÂs doctors set their hopes on a     clinical trial led by ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs, a study testing a checkpoint inhibitor treatment in children who have aggressive brain tumors. The complex strategy has its own set of risks; the treatment often causes inflammation and swelling, a dangerous combination in the contained space of the brain. In describing the trial to EdenÃ¢ÂÂs parents, Rood was cautious. Their daughter would need yet another surgery to reduce the size of her tumor, and there was no guarantee she would be eligible for the trial after that, or that the treatment would work. Ã¢ÂÂAbout the best we can say,Ã¢ÂÂ Rood acknowledged, Ã¢ÂÂis that we donÃ¢ÂÂt know that it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt work. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂEden will be a guinea pig,Ã¢ÂÂ thought EdenÃ¢ÂÂs mother, Sara Amare. But like her husband, Toks Oyelola, she was eager to press ahead. Both knew that the study medication, Keytruda, also called pembrolizumab, was the same one that Carter received after advanced melanoma spread to his liver and brain. Last December, following surgery, radiation and the immunotherapy, the former president announced that his cancer had disappeared. Ã¢ÂÂHe was 91,Ã¢ÂÂ Amare said. Ã¢ÂÂI thought, Ã¢ÂÂSurely, this will work in a   .Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ    As a child with cancer, Eden belongs to a relatively small group. An estimated 16, 000 children up to age 19 will be diagnosed with the disease in the United States this year, and it will kill fewer than 2, 000. By contrast, about 1. 6 million adults are expected to get a diagnosis, and more than 590, 000 will die of the disease. Pediatric oncologists complain that medicines for children are too few and too toxic, largely because drug companies focus their efforts on the adult market. Only one immunotherapy drug has been specifically approved for pediatric cancer. Ã¢ÂÂOver the last 30 years, we have had very, very few new drugs in our clinics, and we still rely on radiation and chemo,Ã¢ÂÂ said Michael Jensen, director of the Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research at Seattle ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs. Ã¢ÂÂWhen a drug is developed for prostate cancer or breast cancer or colon cancer, they will say, Ã¢ÂÂHere, try this for kids with brain tumors.Ã¢ÂÂ It really doesnÃ¢ÂÂt help these underserved kids. Ã¢ÂÂ       Eden likes drawing, ponies, and the toy babies and pets called Twozies. (Michael S.   Washington Post)  Researchers have long known that children are not simply miniature adults; they are biologically different. They tend to get different cancers than adults  Ã¢ÂÂ   leukemia rather than lung cancer, for example  Ã¢ÂÂ   and even the same cancer can play out differently in their bodies. So, perhaps, may immunotherapy. Many adult tumors have mutations caused by cigarette smoke, sunlight and other environmental insults. Once unmasked by a checkpoint inhibitor, such mutations can be seen by the immune system as Ã¢ÂÂforeignÃ¢ÂÂ and deserving of attack. ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs cancers, however, generally have far fewer mutations and thus may offer fewer targets, according to one theory.   [Checkpoint inhibitor helps melanoma patients survive longer ]   Another kind of immunotherapy, called   cell therapy, is being widely tested in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common and once universally fatal childhood cancer. It has shown extraordinary effectiveness in treating recurrent disease.  By contrast, checkpoint inhibitors in children Ã¢ÂÂmay not be the home run they are in adults,Ã¢ÂÂ said Crystal Mackall, head of the cancer immunology and immunotherapy program at the Stanford University School of Medicine. Ã¢ÂÂBut itÃ¢ÂÂs too early to know. Ã¢ÂÂ  The Oyelola family lives in a comfortable house in a gated community in Prince GeorgeÃ¢ÂÂs County, with a back yard big enough to accommodate pony rides on special occasions. Eden, who is obsessed with unicorns, has a    sister, Sade, and an    brother, Tobi. Ã¢ÂÂHe chases me, then I chase him,Ã¢ÂÂ Eden said on a recent afternoon as the children raced around. Dressed in a shirt decorated with lions, tigers and zebras, she showed little sign of being sick, other than a little puffiness in her face and slightly shorter hair where she had surgery.     Eden and her sister, Sade, 7, look at a picture book of animals and insects as they play in their home in Upper Marlboro, Md. (Michael S.   Washington Post)  EdenÃ¢ÂÂs father is a consultant for Ernst & Young whose parents came from Nigeria decades ago. Her mother is a native of Ethi o pia who moved to the United States as a little girl. A wall of photographs in the family room shows a handsome and happy family. On Halloween 2014, Oyelola remembers, Ã¢ÂÂa new normalÃ¢ÂÂ took hold. Amare was driving their daughters home from a school parade  Ã¢ÂÂ   Eden had been dressed up as the country of Russia. Suddenly, Sade cried from the back seat: Ã¢ÂÂMommy, Eden is shaking!Ã¢ÂÂ Saliva foamed on her lips. Doctors at ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs diagnosed a febrile seizure, a   event in childhood. But several weeks later, another seizure followed. This time, ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs did a scan. Ã¢ÂÂWe see a mass,Ã¢ÂÂ the doctors told Amare. Brain surgery was scheduled for Christmas Eve. EdenÃ¢ÂÂs family decorated her   room with lights, wreaths and a tree. When she woke up on Christmas, she was amazed by the presents, sneaked in by nurses, and by a visit from Santa Claus himself. Those would be the only bright spots of the holiday. The ultimate diagnosis was that Eden had a Ã¢ÂÂprimitive, very rare, very unusual tumor,Ã¢ÂÂ Rood said, with many of the characteristics of glioblastoma. This deadly type of cancer arises from glia cells, which support brain function. Months of radiation and chemo followed, ending with the bell party in September 2015. Late last year, the    Foundation arranged for the family to go on an   scavenger hunt that culminated in a ride on a Ã¢ÂÂunicornÃ¢ÂÂ at Verizon Center. Ã¢ÂÂYes, itÃ¢ÂÂs a real unicorn!Ã¢ÂÂ Eden declared, caressing the big white horse.  The tumorÃ¢ÂÂs return in January was a crushing blow. Eden quickly had surgery and eventually entered a clinical study involving pomalidomide, a thalidomide derivative that is thought to interfere with tumor growth. She began getting violent headaches. Ã¢ÂÂShe could wake up in the morning and be hysterical for two hours,Ã¢ÂÂ her father said. And she was having three to four seizures an hour.    EdenÃ¢ÂÂs father, Toks Oyelola, wears a variety of inspirational wristbands. As her tumor grew, he pushed her doctors hard for treatment alternatives. (Michael S.   Washington Post)   The doctors took her off the medicine and talked to her parents about the immunotherapy trial and another operation. Ã¢ÂÂIt was Ã¢ÂÂ Rood said. Yet they had no other options. In late May, Eden had her third surgery, which succeeded in sharply reducing the tumor and the swelling, and in easing her pain. A few days later, she celebrated her sixth birthday.  Not long after, she got a spot in the ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs trial.  Brain and    tumors are the    type of childhood cancers, after leukemia. A patientÃ¢ÂÂs prognosis depends on the type of malignancy, whether cancer cells remain after surgery and whether the tumor recurs.  Given the success seen with checkpoint inhibitors for some adult cancers, there is intense interest in trying them in brain tumors in patients of all ages. The hope is that the immune system will be effective at attacking the tumor and breaching the   barrier, a kind of security system that protects the brain yet also prevents many treatments from getting through. Several pediatric trials are underway or in development, including one trying a combination of checkpoint inhibitors that New YorkÃ¢ÂÂs Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has set for next year.   [How cancer gets around the new immunotherapy drugs]   The    trial at ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs and other institutions is   by the National Cancer Institute and the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, a network of childrenÃ¢ÂÂs hospitals and academic medical centers that conducts   studies of novel treatments. Up to 70 patients will be enrolled, ages 1 to 21, with participants given infusions of Keytruda for 30 minutes every three weeks. The treatments are slated to extend over two years.    Sara Amare has relied on her faith during the nearly two years since her daughter Eden was diagnosed with cancer. (Michael S.   Washington Post)  Eugene Hwang, a pediatric   at ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs, and the other investigators are proceeding carefully because of the risks, frequently Ã¢ÂÂpausingÃ¢ÂÂ the study to examine results and decide whether changes are needed. One of the toughest challenges in using checkpoint inhibitors or any immunotherapy for brain tumors, Hwang said, is figuring out how to produce the right level of immune response. Too weak and it wonÃ¢ÂÂt affect the tumor. But too strong and the swarm of T cells could trigger lethal swelling.  Ã¢ÂÂI have desperation in my back yard, where kids are dying, and thereÃ¢ÂÂs hope the next yard over, where adults who have failed trial after trial are surviving,Ã¢ÂÂ said Hwang, the study chairman. Ã¢ÂÂThere is nothing that is going to dissuade me from trying something that has really revolutionized care for many adults. Ã¢ÂÂ  Eden got her first dose of Keytruda on June 22, and everything seemed fine for the first two weeks. But shortly before her planned second dose, she again began having headaches, and numbness in her left arm. An MRI showed that the mass in her head had doubled in size in barely a month. That raised a critical issue for her physicians: Did the larger mass mean the drug had triggered the robust immune response they wanted? Or was the treatment failing and the cancerÃ¢ÂÂs growth accelerating? Or some combination of both? It was impossible to tell from the scan. Yet the answer would determine whether Eden could continue in the trial. The doctors delayed the second dose and gave her steroids to reduce the brain swelling. That effectively negated the effects of the immunotherapy, but it was the only way to figure out what was happening as they chose how to proceed. Her family tried to carry on with life. They all took a vacation to the beach, making sure they visited Assateague Island to see the wild ponies. Eden seemed to be doing well, and her parents were increasingly sure she would soon get her second Keytruda dose. But on July 28, she awoke in intense pain and was rushed the 20 miles to ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs. The tumor had gotten significantly bigger in just a few weeks and was starting to push the brain from the right side of her head toward the left. Blood and fluid also appeared to be leaking into the space between the brain and the skull. Doctors treated Eden with high levels of painkillers and higher levels of steroids. And they sat down with her parents. Rood told them that the tumorÃ¢ÂÂs fast growth was making it impossible for Eden to stay on the trial. Take her home, Rood suggested, and make her as comfortable as possible. Ã¢ÂÂI canÃ¢ÂÂt accept that,Ã¢ÂÂ Amare said later, even as she talked about going Ã¢ÂÂthe God route. Ã¢ÂÂ At her request, pastors from her Ethio pian Orthodox church have come to pray for her daughter.  Her husband is similarly torn. The doctors, he said, Ã¢ÂÂdonÃ¢ÂÂt expect a miracle to happen. But I do. Ã¢ÂÂ Eden still romps through the house and plays with her dogs, Winter and Summer. On a recent afternoon, bored for the moment, she climbed onto her fatherÃ¢ÂÂs lap and whispered in his ear to take her to Target. She wanted to get more Twozies to add to her already sizable collection of the toy babies and pets. Ã¢ÂÂOkay,Ã¢ÂÂ Oyelola said with a smile. Ã¢ÂÂLetÃ¢ÂÂs go.

2299," Jessie Quinn of Sacramento was 36 years old when loss of appetite, weight loss, some eye issues and finally pelvic pain sent her to the emergency room in 2010. Tests quickly revealed she had acute myeloid leukemia  Ã¢ÂÂ   a type of blood cancer that progresses quickly  Ã¢ÂÂ   and doctors told her that chemotherapy would probably not be enough; she would need a   transplant.  Quinn, who has a science background, knew that finding a donor would be difficult. In college, she had donated to a   registry after learning that people like her, with a mixed racial heritage, have a much harder time than others finding a match. In fact, when she and her doctors scoured the registry for a match for her, only one name came up: her own. Ã¢ÂÂI didnÃ¢ÂÂt know whether to laugh or cry,Ã¢ÂÂ Quinn said. While searching unsuccessfully for a match for five months, Quinn underwent four cycles of chemotherapy to keep the leukemia at bay. What eventually saved her, though, was an experimental transplant using stem cells from the blood of a babyÃ¢ÂÂs umbilical cord, an approach that can be used without perfectly matching blood types.   Colleen Delaney of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle helped create the   technique. (Courtesy of Colleen Delaney )  This therapy and another  Ã¢ÂÂ   haploidentical transplantation, which uses   cells that are only   to a patient  Ã¢ÂÂ   have revolutionized the treatment of blood cancers in the past few years. Every biological child is a   for a parent, and vice versa. Ã¢ÂÂMany patients who previously died for lack of a match are now cured of their underlying malignancy,Ã¢ÂÂ said Richard Jones, director of the   transplant program at Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center. A dangerous process   transplants, which infuse healthy blood cells taken from a donor, are used when chemotherapy and radiation fail to stop cancerous blood cells from taking over and ultimately destroying a personÃ¢ÂÂs immune system.  The transplant can be taken from either the blood or bone marrow, which produces blood cells. The procedure is typically preceded by high doses of chemotherapy and radiation that wipe out the patientÃ¢ÂÂs faulty blood cells and replace them with healthy ones from a donor.  The process is dangerous because it leaves a patient vulnerable to   infection for months before the reconstituted immune system begins to work.   In the past, a patientÃ¢ÂÂs body would reject as a foreign intruder anything but a perfect or   match, a usually fatal development.   stem cells, however, are sort of a blank slate because they havenÃ¢ÂÂt been exposed to much life  Ã¢ÂÂ   such as bacteria and viruses  Ã¢ÂÂ   and thus are more easily accepted even if they arenÃ¢ÂÂt a perfect match.  When QuinnÃ¢ÂÂs doctors found no match on the donor registry, she turned to a clinical trial examining the safety of taking blood cells from umbilical cords, expanding their numbers in a laboratory and then infusing them into patients.

2300,"     The survival rate for   prostate cancer is 99 percent after 10 years, regardless of whether men undergo surgery, radiation or are Ã¢ÂÂactively monitored,Ã¢ÂÂ according to studies published Wednesday. Researchers hailed the results as good news, saying they had been expecting a survival rate of 90 percent. The two new studies, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, also illustrated the complicated treatment equations facing men with   prostate cancer, and they immediately set off a debate among physicians about how to interpret the results. Researchers from the universities of Oxford and Bristol found no difference in survival rates among men who were randomly assigned to surgery, radiation or monitoring; it is the largest study of its kind. Those who underwent surgery or radiation cut in half the risk that their disease would spread to bones and lymph nodes, compared with those who were simply monitored. Although the treatment didnÃ¢ÂÂt extend life during the first 10 years, a survival benefit might yet emerge in the next five or 10 years, the researchers said. The scientists also found that the surgery and radiation treatments sometimes caused severe side effects, including sexual dysfunction, incontinence and bowel problems, that hurt the patientsÃ¢ÂÂ quality of life. Ã¢ÂÂMen with newly diagnosed, localized prostate cancer need to consider the critical   between the   and   effects of radical treatments on urinary, bowel and sexual function and the higher risks of disease progressionÃ¢ÂÂ that comes with monitoring, the researchers wrote. Freddie Hamdy, a professor of surgery and urology at the University of Oxford who was the lead researcher, said his advice to patients is that they should not Ã¢ÂÂrush to receive treatment, but to really digest and really look at the side effects that the treatments produce.Ã¢ÂÂ Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, who had no role in the study, agreed. Ã¢ÂÂWe have already had an increased number of men in the United States who choose to be observed after diagnosis, and I would hope this would encourage more of that,Ã¢ÂÂ he said of the study. But he also acknowledged that there would be differences of opinions about the study, adding, Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂs a little something for everybody.Ã¢ÂÂ   [Leading researchers recommend major change in prostate cancer treatment]   Indeed, in an editorial that accompanied the studies, Anthony DÃ¢ÂÂAmico, chief of genitourinary radiation oncology at Brigham and WomenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital and   Cancer Institute, emphasized the studiesÃ¢ÂÂ finding that surgery and radiation reduced the risk of metastasis and disease progression. Ã¢ÂÂIf a man wishes to avoid metastatic prostate cancer and the side effects of its treatment, monitoring should be considered only if he has   coexisting diseaseÃ¢ÂÂ that might prevent him from living for much longer than 10 years. Jim Hu, a urologic oncologist at Weill Cornell Medicine, said he was struck by the Ã¢ÂÂsignificant differences in the likelihood of metastatic disease,Ã¢ÂÂ which he said could eventually translate into a survival benefit for the men who got surgery or radiation. But other physicians said that might not be the case, and that men who got the treatments might die first from other causes, such as heart attacks. For the British study, more than 82, 000 men between 1999 and 2009, ages 50 to 69 were tested with a blood test called PSA, for   antigen. About 1, 600 were diagnosed with   cancer and agreed to take part in the study. They were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Those who got surgery to remove the prostate, called a radical prostatectomy; those who got radiation; and those who got active monitoring, which researchers described as Ã¢ÂÂless passiveÃ¢ÂÂ than the Ã¢ÂÂwatchful waitingÃ¢ÂÂ stance used by many doctors in the United States. Researchers studied mortality rates at 10 years and whether the cancer progressed and spread; a second study addressed the impact of the treatments reported by the men. Their conclusion was that the three approaches did not translate into Ã¢ÂÂsignificant differencesÃ¢ÂÂ in deaths caused by prostate cancer or other causes. Ã¢ÂÂThus,Ã¢ÂÂ they concluded, Ã¢ÂÂ    is necessary.Ã¢ÂÂ Part of the conundrum facing researchers and clinicians is that prostate cancer is both overtreated and undertreated. For years, many doctors say, men were overtreated based on the results of a PSA test. The test can result in Ã¢ÂÂfalse positives,Ã¢ÂÂ or encourage aggressive treatment of malignancies that are so   that they arenÃ¢ÂÂt a threat. In many cases, men no longer get PSA tests as a routine matter. However, men still die from prostate cancer  Ã¢ÂÂ   because doctors donÃ¢ÂÂt know which cases will turn into a lethal, metastatic form of the disease. More than 180, 000 men in the United States will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year, and more than 26, 000 will die from the disease.   [How the   mutation gene can affect men]   Ã¢ÂÂEverybody is searching for the key to identifying cancers that will progress,Ã¢ÂÂ or spread, said Jenny Donovan, a researcher at the University of Bristol who took part in the studies. Ã¢ÂÂWe all want to do that.Ã¢ÂÂ Brawley, of the American Cancer Society, noted: Ã¢ÂÂThis study has just 10 years of data, and it may take 20 or 25 years to see survival improvements from treatment, so we cannot say yet with certainty whether and how much of an advantage treatment has over no treatment. We can only say that at 10 years, there is no difference.Ã¢ÂÂ Read more: How cancer can thwart immunotherapy drugs The FDA requires new warnings on combining opioids and benzodiazepines Teenage boysÃ¢ÂÂ HPV vaccination rate hits 50 percent",cancer,"Almost all men with early prostate cancer survive 10 years, regardless of treatment",2300.0,2300.0,300.0,
2301,"         By the time    Ava Christianson got to the National Institutes of Health this summer, she had lost several grueling rounds to leukemia and was bracing for the next one. Intensive chemotherapy, which cures up to 90 percent of children with the most common type of leukemia, hadnÃ¢ÂÂt kept her cancer from coming back. Neither had a painful   transplant nor an experimental treatment. Her careworn father cried in the shower to hide his anguish. Her mother couldnÃ¢ÂÂt help but wonder, Ã¢ÂÂWhy is this happening to our child?Ã¢ÂÂ But Ava was fortunate in one respect. Discoveries in the burgeoning field of immunotherapy are offering lifelines to desperate patients who previously had none. Ã¢ÂÂFive years ago,Ã¢ÂÂ said her mother, Bethany Christianson, Ã¢ÂÂour doctor would have just had to tell us to go home. Ã¢ÂÂ Instead, in a   procedure at the NIH Clinical Center in late July, the   girl got another chance to beat the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that has stalked her since age 4. She was infused with 30 million of her own T cells, a key part of the immune system, that had been genetically modified to track down and kill her cancer like a pack of crazed dogs. AvaÃ¢ÂÂs treatment, called CAR   therapy, is one of the new immunotherapies that attempt to rally the bodyÃ¢ÂÂs own defenses to fight malignancies. Unlike other cancer advances, it is being tested widely in children because of its stunning effectiveness in ALL, the most common pediatric cancer. In   trials, many patients who had repeatedly relapsed saw their leukemia disappear. Some remain  . Yet big questions surround the therapy, and many scientists are urging caution. Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂs very real promise with this approach, but the immune system is complicated,Ã¢ÂÂ said Terry Fry, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) scientist who is running AvaÃ¢ÂÂs trial. Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot that still needs to be worked out. Ã¢ÂÂ   [HereÃ¢ÂÂs what you need to know about immunotherapy]   Complications can be lethal; one clinical trial was briefly halted in July after three young adults died of brain swelling. It is also far from clear that such a personalized approach  Ã¢ÂÂ   possibly costing hundreds of thousands of dollars  Ã¢ÂÂ   is economically viable on a large scale or will produce the lasting remissions that everyone hopes to see. U. S. researchers running CAR   trials for children and adults with leukemia and lymphoma have reported remission rates up to 90 percent in some cases. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a major achievement in a group whose cancer is emboldened by every treatment failure. But rates in other trials are considerably lower, and many patients eventually relapse. Ã¢ÂÂThe treatment is great about getting people into remission but not at keeping everyone in remission,Ã¢ÂÂ said Rebecca Gardner, a pediatric oncologist at Seattle ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs hospital. She ran an   trial using CAR   therapy in which 39 of 42 patients went into complete remission. By a year, about half had relapsed, either because their T cells had inexplicably disappeared or their cancer had changed so that the T cells could no longer recognize it. Ã¢ÂÂLeukemia is really smart,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. AvaÃ¢ÂÂs family understands that better than most. She underwent her first CAR   procedure in Minnesota last year, but her leukemia returned within six months. Her treatment at NIH involved a   version, developed by NCI, that used a different target for her marauding T cells. In this    trial, she is Patient No. 18. In late August, the Christiansons learned that Ava had gone into remission. She and her mother, who were still at the Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md. gleefully rushed home to Wisconsin so Ava could start third grade.     Ava, who is participating in a clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health, plays with her mother, Bethany Christianson, during a checkup visit in September. (Marvin   Washington Post)  Her parents, so frequently disappointed, remain guardedly optimistic. Ã¢ÂÂHope is all you have,Ã¢ÂÂ said her father, Jay Christianson. Her mother added, Ã¢ÂÂWe just need this to work and to stay working. Ã¢ÂÂ NCIÃ¢ÂÂs Fry is careful not to make any promises about an extended remission. Ã¢ÂÂI canÃ¢ÂÂt say thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to be the case,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, Ã¢ÂÂbecause we just donÃ¢ÂÂt know. ItÃ¢ÂÂs too soon. Ã¢ÂÂ  Scientists have wanted for decades to marshal the immune system to vanquish cancer, but their attempts have mostly been frustrated. In the past few years, however, breakthroughs have led to the development of two types of immunotherapy  Ã¢ÂÂ   checkpoint inhibitors and CAR T cells  Ã¢ÂÂ   that are generating enormous excitement. Checkpoint inhibitors are    therapies aimed at unleashing the immune systemÃ¢ÂÂs power to see and attack the disease. Used mostly in adults, to date, they are producing impressive results, albeit in a minority of cases. The most prominent: Jimmy Carter. The former president became the poster patient when he was successfully treated last year with a checkpoint inhibitor called Keytruda, along with surgery and radiation, for his advanced melanoma. Much of the earliest research for customized CAR   therapy was conducted at NCI, the University of Pennsylvania, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Seattle ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs. Ã¢ÂÂThe technology of CAR T cells is really a breakthrough, especially for children,Ã¢ÂÂ said Michael Jensen, director of the Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research at Seattle ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Research Institute. Almost all the initial work focused on CD19, a protein found on the surface of   acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Scientists figured out ways to use a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, to reprogram T cells to recognize the protein and kill the cancer.   [Immunotherapy is showing benefits in an increasing number of cancers]   Zane Esposito, a    from Plano, Tex. calls himself the Ã¢ÂÂ  Explorer. Ã¢ÂÂ He was diagnosed with ALL in June 2010. Ã¢ÂÂI just thought my back hurt,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂI couldnÃ¢ÂÂt walk up the steps very well. Ã¢ÂÂ Almost three years of treatment, including punishing chemotherapy, provided a couple of years of remission. His leukemia returned in January, and this time it did not respond to treatment. Soon after Zane relapsed, he and his father bumped into friends in a local doughnut shop who told them about a TV segment on CAR   therapy. Paul Esposito searched online and found GardnerÃ¢ÂÂs clinical trial in Seattle. Zane signed on, got the treatment, went back into full remission and gained 25 pounds.  His Texas doctors have talked about a   transplant to increase the chance of a true cure, but the Espositos have resisted. The Seattle doctors say it is not clear yet whether that is necessary or whether there would be still other options should ZaneÃ¢ÂÂs cancer recur. Zane is moving on, with dreams of competing on Ã¢ÂÂChopped JuniorÃ¢ÂÂ to show off his homemade pasta and pizza. On July 27, the day that Ava got her T cells, he celebrated his 13th birthday.  Ava was 4 when she started having leg pains, then trouble standing up. Her mother suspected Lyme disease. Ã¢ÂÂYou never think of cancer with a child,Ã¢ÂÂ she said, eyes filling as she recalled her daughterÃ¢ÂÂs cancer diagnosis in November 2012. The doctors assured the family that it was typical leukemia  Ã¢ÂÂ   and curable.    Ava receives   therapy for leukemia from nurse Julie Thompson at the NIH Clinical Center, her mother nearby for support. (Bill OÃ¢ÂÂ  Washington Post)  Like most children, Ava quickly went into remission after starting the prescribed 30 months of chemotherapy. But at home in Prescott, a small Wisconsin city at the confluence of the Mississippi and St. Croix rivers, things did not get easier for the Christiansons. In early 2013, Ava was hospitalized in Minneapolis for a lung infection. About the same time, the coupleÃ¢ÂÂs second daughter, Audrey, was born 13 weeks premature and hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit in St. Paul. Bethany, who manages occupational therapists for a   chain, and Jay, a rural mail carrier, shuttled between the Twin Cities visiting their daughters. Ã¢ÂÂI would be with Ava during the day, and then when Jay got home, he would stay with Ava, and I would spend time with Audrey,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂNo matter what you do, you feel like a bad mom. Ã¢ÂÂ A year or so after treatment began, Ava relapsed. Now she was in a much more dangerous category: children whose leukemia no longer responds to chemo. Her doctors arranged for a   transplant, with her baby sister as the donor. The transplant made her sick and the whole family miserable. Ava spent months in the hospital and then a year at home. Because of fears of infection, she couldnÃ¢ÂÂt go out much. She missed all of first grade. But her parents had hope that the transplant would keep her cancer at bay.   [Brain cancer now the leading cause of cancer deaths in children]   At a   checkup, tests showed that the leukemia was back again. There were no more conventional treatments to try. But because of her two relapses, Ava was now eligible for a CAR   trial at the University of Minnesota Masonic ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital. Her T cells would be genetically altered to go after CD19. The number of cells then would be vastly increased and reinfused. It sounded like science fiction, but Bethany Christianson found comfort in talking to the father of Emily Whitehead. In 2012, the    Pennsylvania girl became the first child to be treated with reprogrammed T cells for leukemia. She has been in remission ever since. Ava got her treatment in April 2015  Ã¢ÂÂ   after her cells were extracted via a tube inserted into her neck  Ã¢ÂÂ   and five days later had a massive immune reaction with a high fever and intense pain. While that is typical, some patients become dangerously ill. Yet Ava recovered fast, went into remission and attended summer school, where she learned how to make     and wrote her own cookbook. By then, her parents had gotten used to living in the midst of remissions and relapses. Ã¢ÂÂWhen she felt better, we would do everything we could,Ã¢ÂÂ Bethany said. They visited Robot World, a scientifically themed attraction a few hours from Prescott. Ã¢ÂÂYou donÃ¢ÂÂt put things off, because you are always thinking, Ã¢ÂÂWhat if?Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Last fall, doctors delivered the bad news. AvaÃ¢ÂÂs cancer had changed. It was no longer producing the CD19 protein, which meant her modified T cells could no longer recognize the disease. But the leukemia was still producing another common protein, called CD22, and that offered an opportunity.  As it happened, Fry, head of the   section in NCIÃ¢ÂÂs pediatric oncology branch, had already launched the worldÃ¢ÂÂs first trial using CAR   therapy to focus on CD22. It seemed an equally promising target that could broaden the therapyÃ¢ÂÂs impact, researchers thought. At the time, they did not realize that a significant percentage of patients in the other trials might relapse because of changes in their cancer.  Fry insisted as he designed the study that children be included, despite   concerns about exposing them to safety risks. He wanted to avoid a delay in testing what could be a lifesaving pediatric treatment. Ã¢ÂÂI didnÃ¢ÂÂt want to take two to three years on adults, and then go back and do children,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.  [For a    with cancer, a future staked on medicineÃ¢ÂÂs hottest field]  The clinical trial already has treated nearly two dozen leukemia and lymphoma patients through age 30. The majority have gone into remission, although some have had their cancer return. While it is far too early to know   outcomes, Fry said he is convinced the CD22 treatment holds much potential. He is planning another trial next year with the Stanford University School of Medicine. It will target both proteins  Ã¢ÂÂ   CD19 and CD22  Ã¢ÂÂ   simultaneously.    With her leukemia in remission following a promising immunotherapy procedure being tested at NIH, Ava was able to start third grade with her friends. (Marvin   Washington Post)  Once Ava relapsed after the Minnesota trial, FryÃ¢ÂÂs study at the NIH Clinical Center appeared to be the only option. But there was no slot immediately available. With Ava deteriorating, doctors put her on an experimental treatment that sent her into remission but had serious side effects. They immediately stopped the medication when they learned Ava might get her   therapy in January  Ã¢ÂÂ   she actually needed a high level of leukemia in her body to participate. But on this wrenching roller coaster of research and treatment, it turned out that she still had to wait several more months. AvaÃ¢ÂÂs cancer returned in June. Her T cells were extracted in preparation for the trial, even as she got sicker and sicker. She was admitted to the Clinical Center in   to a room with dancing penguins painted on the windows. The day before her therapy, an ebullient Audrey burst into the room and the two sisters ran down the hall to a play space. Her mother was ready this time for the intense immune reaction that followed treatment, although she still found it hard to watch Ava spike a fever of 106. Ã¢ÂÂWhen you see that temperature on the thermometer, every bone in your body says itÃ¢ÂÂs wrong to let it get that high,Ã¢ÂÂ Bethany said. Ã¢ÂÂThen suddenly itÃ¢ÂÂs over. Ã¢ÂÂ If his daughterÃ¢ÂÂs cancer returns yet again, Ã¢ÂÂI have no idea what weÃ¢ÂÂll do,Ã¢ÂÂ Jay said. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre kind of up against the edge. Ã¢ÂÂ Fry thinks she might be able to undergo a second round of her latest immunotherapy, as long as her cancer is still producing CD22 proteins. Doctors in Minnesota also might recommend a second   transplant  Ã¢ÂÂ   something her parents dread, saying it was the roughest treatment of all. For now, Ava is happily back in school. Ã¢ÂÂI just want her to be a kid,Ã¢ÂÂ Bethany Christianson said. Ã¢ÂÂShe has missed out on a lot of that.

2302,"     Oral cancer is on the rise in American men, with health insurance claims for the condition jumping 61 percent from 2011 to 2015, according to a new analysis. The most dramatic increases were in throat cancer and tongue cancer, and the data show that claims were nearly three times as common in men as in women during that same period with a split of 74 percent to 26 percent. The startling numbers  Ã¢ÂÂ   published in a report on Tuesday by FAIR Health an independent nonprofit  Ã¢ÂÂ   are based on a database of more than 21 billion privately billed medical and dental claims. They illustrate both the cascading effect of human papillomavirus (HPV) in the United States and our changing sexual practices. The American Cancer Society estimates that nearly 50, 000 Americans will be infected this year, with 9, 500 dying from the disease. In past generations, oral cancer was mostly linked to smoking, alcohol use or a combination of the two. But even as smoking rates have fallen, oral cancer rates have remained about the same, and researchers have documented in recent studies that this may be caused by HPV. HPV infects cells of the skin and the membranes that lines areas such as the mouth, throat, tongue, tonsils, rectum and sexual organs. Transmission can occur when these areas come into contact with the virus. HPV is a leading cause of cervical, vaginal and penile cancers.      The HPV vaccine can prevent a number of common cancers, but still has a low uptake rate ten years after itÃ¢ÂÂs release. Here are some reasons why. (Deirdra OÃ¢ÂÂ  Washington Post)   Surveys have shown that younger men are more likely to perform oral sex than their older counterparts and have a tendency to engage with more partners. Ã¢ÂÂThese differences in sexual behavior across age cohorts explain the differences that we see in oral HPV prevalence and in   oropharyngeal cancer across the generations and why the rate of this cancer is increasing,Ã¢ÂÂ Gypsyamber DÃ¢ÂÂSouza, an associate professor in the Viral Oncology and Cancer Prevention and Control Program at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said at the time. The work was published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. In February, researchers at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting reported that men are not only more likely to be infected with oral HPV than women but are less likely to clear the infection. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not known why oral HPV is more aggressive in men.    (Ã¢ÂÂOral Cancer: A Growing Health Concern,Ã¢ÂÂ FAIR Health October 2016)  HPV is an extremely common virus that has infected nearly 80 million, or one in four, people in the United States. Fortunately, the risk of contracting HPV can be greatly reduced by a vaccine. HPV has become a public health priority in recent years with dozens of countries recommending universal vaccination. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children get it at the age of 11 or 12, although they may get vaccinated as early as 9 years old. The CDC said earlier this month that young people who get it before the age of 15 need two doses rather than the typical three. A CDC study has found that although fewer teenagers and young adults are having sex than in previous years, more are engaging in oral sex than vaginal intercourse under the assumption that itÃ¢ÂÂs safer. Ã¢ÂÂHowever, young people, particularly those who have oral sex before their first vaginal intercourse, may still be placing themselves at risk of STIs or HIV before they are ever at risk of pregnancy,Ã¢ÂÂ the researchers wrote in the 2012 report.

2303," Lung cancer, which kills almost 160, 000 Americans a year, is among the cruelest of foes. Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, undergo punishing chemotherapy and still have a bleak prognosis. More than half die within a year. Bit by bit, though, scientists are making progress against the nationÃ¢ÂÂs biggest cancer killer. Years ago, they began approaching lung cancer as many different diseases rather than a single one. The 15 percent of patients with certain   mutations, for example, today get Ã¢ÂÂtargetedÃ¢ÂÂ medications that work better than chemo. This Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ strategy, as one researcher describes it, is poised to make an even bigger advance  Ã¢ÂÂ   one that involves the immunotherapy drug used as part of former president Jimmy CarterÃ¢ÂÂs successful treatment for advanced melanoma. It could benefit tens of thousands of patients in the United States alone  Ã¢ÂÂ   as many as a third of those diagnosed at a late stage with the most common form of the disease. The treatment shift stems from a major international trial in which the drug, Keytruda, beat chemo on both effectiveness and safety in patients who have advanced cancer and a high concentration of a specific protein on their tumors. The Food and Drug Administration last month approved Keytruda as a   treatment for such cases, the first time immunotherapy has been given the green light as an initial treatment for lung cancer. The result is that most new patients now will be tested for the protein, called  . If they have a high level on their cancer cells, theyÃ¢ÂÂll receive Keytruda rather than chemo, which is much more debilitating, oncologists say.     Ã¢ÂÂWe donÃ¢ÂÂt want to oversell this, but for someone like me who has worked in the trenches for years, this is a big deal,Ã¢ÂÂ said Julie Brahmer, who led the clinical trial and is the interim director of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins. Ã¢ÂÂI have had one patient on this [drug] for five years, and she has seen her daughter graduate from high school and college. Ã¢ÂÂ ItÃ¢ÂÂs decidedly good news in a field where gains are excruciatingly hard to come by and funding lags behind that of many other types of cancer. The National Institutes of Health estimated it would spend $362 million on   research in fiscal 2016, compared to almost $700 million for   research. Yet lung cancer kills four times more people annually.  Because smoking is the main cause, lung cancer carries a stigma among doctors, the public and patients themselves, studies show. Ã¢ÂÂPatients are sometimes blamed as being responsible for their disease even though we donÃ¢ÂÂt do that to people who are obese or have heart disease or other conditions that may be lifestyle related,Ã¢ÂÂ said Albert Rizzo, senior medical adviser to the American Lung Association. Ã¢ÂÂNobody deserves to have lung cancer. Ã¢ÂÂ The stigma, plus a sense of futility among some physicians, can contribute to the undertreatment of patients with advanced disease. Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of nihilism among some community oncologists, who say patients do poorlyÃ¢ÂÂ on treatments and may not have much experience with newer treatments, including immunotherapy, Brahmer said. She and others say immunotherapy, though not a cure, offers an alternative for certain patients whose only option had been chemo.  Ã¢ÂÂTen years ago, there was almost nothing for lung cancer,Ã¢ÂÂ said Giuseppe Giaccone, an oncologist at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center and an investigator in the trial. Ã¢ÂÂThen we got targeted therapies for small subsets of patients, and now we have this immunotherapy for a larger group. Ã¢ÂÂ He thinks that scientists Ã¢ÂÂare just at the beginning with immunotherapy,Ã¢ÂÂ with more gains to follow as they learn how to better use it.  Ruzanna Hovanesian, an    resident of Glendale, Calif. is enthusiastic about her treatment. A smoker for 44 years who dropped the habit two decades ago, she was diagnosed in July 2013 with advanced lung cancer. She never received chemo, instead enrolling in an early Keytruda trial that caused only minor side effects, she wrote in an email. Today, she said, Ã¢ÂÂI feel very good. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂWhat is most exciting is that this is not an anecdotal response,Ã¢ÂÂ said Edward Garon, an oncologist at the University of California at Los Angeles who treated Hovanesian and was an investigator in the Keytruda trial. Ã¢ÂÂAlthough patients with results like this are a minority, they are still a significant segment of the patients treated. Ã¢ÂÂ In many ways, whatÃ¢ÂÂs happening in lung cancer is emblematic of the overall field of oncology. Immunotherapy has been approved for several types of cancer, but its ultimate power is not yet clear. In some cancers, like the pancreatic form, it has had little effect. And even in cancers in which it does work, usually only a minority of individuals are helped, and it can cause side effects. Yet among those patients who do respond, some have what doctors call Ã¢ÂÂdurable remissions,Ã¢ÂÂ extending life far beyond the few months that might otherwise have been expected. Because the treatments are so new, researchers say itÃ¢ÂÂs impossible to know how long such remissions will last. And the cost of such progress is high given KeytrudaÃ¢ÂÂs $150, 000 annual price tag. In the Keytruda study, 70 percent of the patients who were given the drug, also known as pembrolizumab, were alive at one year, compared with 54 percent of the chemo group, Brahmer said. The median for   survival  Ã¢ÂÂ   the period during which the disease did not get worse  Ã¢ÂÂ   was 10. 3 months in the Keytruda group compared with six months in the chemo group. The Keytruda group also experienced significantly fewer serious side effects. Although the difference might not sound   it is significant in the research world. An independent monitoring committee was so impressed that it took the unusual step of recommending that the trial be halted early to allow the chemo patients to switch to Keytruda. The trial also underscored the increasing importance of biomarkers  Ã¢ÂÂ   in this case,    Ã¢ÂÂ   in helping physicians decide who is likely to benefit from the new treatments. The study was restricted to patients who had   on at least 50 percent of their cancer cells. Almost half of those in the Keytruda group had significant tumor shrinkage, compared with 28 percent in the chemo group.  Researchers say such biomarkers, which indicate the features of particular tumors, could pave the way for Ã¢ÂÂindividualized immunotherapy. Ã¢ÂÂ   binds to another protein called   which is located on T cells, a key part of the immune system. When that Ã¢ÂÂhandshakeÃ¢ÂÂ occurs, it discourages the immune system from attacking the cancer. Keytruda, made by Merck, is the only immunotherapy drug approved for previously untreated patients with advanced lung cancer. Other immunotherapy medications are approved as   therapies. Bob Schoenbauer, 82, who lives in Waldorf, Md. started coughing in late 2013 and months later was diagnosed with inoperable   lung cancer. He was enrolled in a clinical trial at Georgetown in which he was treated simultaneously with chemo and a Genentech immunotherapy drug called Tecentriq. Within four months, his cancer had disappeared. The chemo was discontinued, but Schoenbauer has opted to stay on the immunotherapy drug, which he and his doctors credit with his continuing remission. Ã¢ÂÂBefore the treatment, I was coughing my brains out,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Now, the   walks a few miles a few times a week at a mall. Researchers say that smokers and   seem to benefit more from immunotherapy than nonsmokers. That may be because their cells have many mutations caused by cigarettes, which may make it easier for the immune system, once boosted by a drug, to see and attack the cancer. The Keytruda trial involved more than 300 people who had advanced    lung cancer, the most common form of the disease, but didnÃ¢ÂÂt have certain   mutations. More than 220, 000 cases of lung cancer are diagnosed in the United States every year, and about 158, 000 people die of the disease. Globally, the World Health Organization says lung cancer kills about 1. 6 million people every year.

Woodward forged friendship with Heber after meeting him in the hospital.

2305,"     When Angelina Jolie published an essay in the New York Times about her decision in 2013 to get a double mastectomy, the essay quickly went viral. JolieÃ¢ÂÂs frank and candid admission that she had inherited a Ã¢ÂÂfaultyÃ¢ÂÂ BRCA1 gene that increased her risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer and struggled with what to do struck a chord with people. Jolie revealed that she had undergone a medical procedure rarely talked about openly, much less by   celebrities, and said she hoped her experience could help others. Ã¢ÂÂToday it is possible to find out through a blood test whether you are highly susceptible to breast and ovarian cancer, and then take action,Ã¢ÂÂ Jolie wrote. A new study published in the British Medical Journal found that thousands of additional women got tested for mutations in the breast cancer risk genes in the U. S.    but probably not the right women. Testing rates increased 64 percent in the three weeks after JolieÃ¢ÂÂs editorial, compared with the three weeks before, according to researchers at Harvard Medical School. The study canÃ¢ÂÂt prove that JolieÃ¢ÂÂs essay caused the bump in testing, but researchers did not find a similar increase in test rates over the same time period the previous year. Meanwhile, the mastectomy rates among women who had a genetic test actually declined after the piece was published, suggesting the women who got the tests done werenÃ¢ÂÂt as likely to have the mutation.  And all that testing comes at a cost: The researchers estimated 4, 500 additional genetic tests were performed, at a cost of $13. 5 million. Ã¢ÂÂThe Ã¢ÂÂJolie effectÃ¢ÂÂ is real,Ã¢ÂÂ said Timothy Caulfield, a professor of law at the University of Alberta who focuses on health policy and was not involved in the study. Ã¢ÂÂOne way to interpret that is that people who didnÃ¢ÂÂt need to get the test got the test. That didnÃ¢ÂÂt necessarily result in this targeted information campaign where people that were genuinely at increased risk and needed this test were getting this.Ã¢ÂÂ The study suggests a   sword when celebrities talk about health issues. Ã¢ÂÂOur findings suggest that celebrity endorsements can be extremely effective and relatively   compared to a lot of public health awareness campaigns,Ã¢ÂÂ said Sunita Desai, a health care economist at Harvard Medical School who led the study. But they may not start the discussion among the people actually at greatest risk. JolieÃ¢ÂÂs essay was a disclosure, not an endorsement    a window into her own   when facing a scary prognosis. It was thoughtful and restrained and clearly noted that JolieÃ¢ÂÂs risks werenÃ¢ÂÂt typical of most women who develop breast cancer. Ã¢ÂÂOnly a fraction of breast cancers result from an inherited gene mutation,Ã¢ÂÂ she wrote. But the essay had a profound effect nonetheless, suggesting medical professionals may want to pay attention when celebrities talk about their own health. Actor Ben Stiller recently credited a prostate cancer screening test with saving his life, raising concerns that more men will get a form of screening that medical experts say causes more harm than good.  The downside of excessive testing may seem minimal. Maybe the women who got tested were unlikely to carry the gene mutation, but whatÃ¢ÂÂs the harm in knowing? One answer is that the test cost, on average, $3, 000. Unnecessary testing can waste limited health care resources and may also cause stress. But another way to answer the question is to think about the major causes of breast cancer in women. Most women who develop breast cancer never inherited a faulty BRCA gene; they develop cancer for other reasons. Learning a negative test result could possibly make them less cautious about other forms of prevention or screening. Ã¢ÂÂThe negative effect of that disclosure is the women who went and had these tests, which came back negative now have a false sense of security that they werenÃ¢ÂÂt going to develop breast cancer    which is totally wrong, because they still have the    populationÃ¢ÂÂ risk of the general public, said Mark Boguski, a pathologist who works at the company Inspirata and   books about what people can learn from celebrity illness.

2306,"     Three weeks before her wedding day, Cheyann Shaw uploaded a video to YouTube, a space the fitness fanatic regularly filled with workout clips and health tips. But this time was different: She was now using the social video platform for a more emotional and profound purpose. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm going to cry,Ã¢ÂÂ she said in the video, Ã¢ÂÂbut  Ã¢ÂÂ   I was told that I have cancer. Ã¢ÂÂ Shaw has stage 4   serous ovarian cancer, a rare and   but stubborn strain that can be resistant to chemotherapy treatments. Over the past four months, she started chemo  Ã¢ÂÂ   then realized it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt working. She lost her hair  Ã¢ÂÂ   and filmed the moment she shaved her head. She has been diagnosed and   and moved from Florida to Washington state to be closer to her family and specialists. She has undergone surgery to remove her reproductive organs, appendix, spleen and part of her colon, along with a tumor from her abdomen that was the size of a small beach ball. And, she said, she has learned that the ovarian cancer is still in her lymph nodes. She has been sharing her swift decline from a   bodybuilder to a   cancer patient to show that having cancer Ã¢ÂÂdoesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean you stop living. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂI decided to document everything right after I got diagnosed because I wanted to show people what cancer does to a body,Ã¢ÂÂ she told The Washington Post last week. She also wanted Ã¢ÂÂto show people that with a positive mind, you can beat this. Ã¢ÂÂ      Cheyann is a bodybuilder and social media star diagnosed with stage 3 ovarian cancer. She has been documenting her cancer fight through videos and photos shared on YouTube and Instagram. (Cheyann Clark)    Shaw, 23, is a real estate assistant for her husband, Kaleb, an agent in Kissimmee, Fla. outside Orlando. She has always been an athlete, playing basketball, softball and soccer. She once raced BMX. Then, about three years ago, she got into fitness. She had her first bodybuilding competition last year, she said, and was preparing for more shows over the summer when her ovarian cancer was diagnosed. Shaw said she had started having symptoms, as early as fall 2015; but in June, she found a lump on her abdomen. Her   told her it was probably a cyst or some torn abdominal muscles from working out too hard. But the next month, she was making trips to the emergency room, with sharp pains and an inability to keep anything down. In August, she said, her doctors found the disease. Ã¢ÂÂToday, August 3rd, 2016 is the day that has changed my life for the moment,Ã¢ÂÂ she wrote on Instagram. Ã¢ÂÂI found out today that I have been diagnosed with cancer. . . . I never in a million years thought this would happen to me, especially since I am only 23, but I know I will win this battle. Ã¢ÂÂ    (Courtesy of Cheyann  )  Ever since, Shaw has been posting photos, videos and messages to keep family members, friends and supporters updated on a journey that she warned would be unashamedly raw. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm literally going to show you the good, the bad and the ugly,Ã¢ÂÂ she said on YouTube, adding, Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm literally showing you guys everything just so everybody is more aware of ovarian cancer because they do call it Ã¢ÂÂthe silent killer. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ  Ovarian cancer is uncommon, with about 20, 000 U. S. women diagnosed each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most common in postmenopausal women, ovarian cancer begins in the ovaries but can still spread throughout the abdomen. In advanced stages, it is more difficult to treat, according to data from Mayo Clinic. The CDC reports that Ã¢ÂÂovarian cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system, but it accounts for only about 3% of all cancers in women. Ã¢ÂÂ ShawÃ¢ÂÂs doctor, Renata Urban, said the bodybuilder has epithelial ovarian cancer, in which cancer cells form from the tissues of the gynecologic tract. Urban, who treats gynecologic oncology patients through the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, said there is no routine screening for ovarian cancer. It is often not diagnosed until the disease is in stage 3 or 4. For patients who are in the advanced stages, she said, the   survival rate is between 30 and 50 percent. The survival rate for epithelial ovarian cancer Ã¢ÂÂis not high,Ã¢ÂÂ Urban told The Post. But, she said, younger patients have been found to have better outcomes. Ã¢ÂÂEpithelial ovarian cancers are generally found in older women, so, for her age, itÃ¢ÂÂs uncommon,Ã¢ÂÂ Urban said of Shaw. Ã¢ÂÂSheÃ¢ÂÂs been extremely courageous and has such a positive attitude. Ã¢ÂÂ  Shaw showed her first chemo treatment on social media. Ã¢ÂÂIt wasnÃ¢ÂÂt as scary as I thought,Ã¢ÂÂ she wrote on Instagram. She bragged on YouTube about her new   diet of ice cream and macaroni and cheese to help her keep on the pounds during her treatments. And she posted a photo of her first day back in the gym.    (Courtesy of Cheyann  )  In other posts, she has aimed to shed a tragic but truthful light on cancer. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm human, I cry and IÃ¢ÂÂm scared,Ã¢ÂÂ she wrote in one post, adding: Ã¢ÂÂCancer has taken so much from me already and on nights like tonight, I try to remember that it is okay to cry; itÃ¢ÂÂs good to cry. I donÃ¢ÂÂt have to be strong all the time, but I will not let cancer take my light and my smile. Ã¢ÂÂ  In September, she posted a video showing the moment she walked into a hair salon to have her head shaved because, she said, Ã¢ÂÂit just bums me out to see my hair falling out. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs the moment of truth  Ã¢ÂÂ   IÃ¢ÂÂm getting my hair cut, er not cut, IÃ¢ÂÂm getting my head shaved,Ã¢ÂÂ said Shaw, with her long,   hair. The following month, she appeared in a video from her bedroom in Seattle, saying she had moved there from Florida. She had learned that hers was a rare form of ovarian cancer, she said, and that it was not responding to chemotherapy treatments, which had taken a harsh toll on the body she had worked so hard to sculpt. At her lowest, she weighed 102 pounds, and her body had started eating its own muscles for nutrients, she said. SheÃ¢ÂÂs now 107. Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm skin and bones,Ã¢ÂÂ the    Shaw said. On Halloween, she went for surgery  Ã¢ÂÂ   filming the moment she went to the hospital, and posting photos after it was done. Ã¢ÂÂSurgery was 5. 5 hours,Ã¢ÂÂ she wrote after the operation. Ã¢ÂÂI did have to get a blood transfusion because I did lose a lot of blood. They got all the cancer they could see out, took my spleen, appendix, full hysterectomy, and part of my colon out. I am not cancer free however. There is cancer is a couple lymph nodes. This doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean I am going to die, it just means I have to fight a lot harder. Scared is an understatement, but I know GOD is with me and I will be fine. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂSome people may see the cancer being in my lymph nodes a step backwards,Ã¢ÂÂ she added, Ã¢ÂÂbut I just see it as just another bump in the road. I will never question GOD because I know he is at work to heal me and the devil will try whatever he can to get me to turn my back on the Lord; which will never happen. I will beat this, just have a little longer and harder road to travel on. Ã¢ÂÂ A week later, she posted a picture showing her surgery scar on her   stomach. Ã¢ÂÂWhen they were in surgery they did find out IÃ¢ÂÂm actually Stage 4 because the cancer was in my spleen and I do have cancer in my lymph nodes, but IÃ¢ÂÂm not worried,Ã¢ÂÂ she wrote. Ã¢ÂÂJust another bump to get over and with GOD by my side IÃ¢ÂÂm not scared. IÃ¢ÂÂll be fine and GOD will get me through this. I have a story to tell and IÃ¢ÂÂm not done telling it and GOD knows that. Ã¢ÂÂ Shaw has started a more targeted form of chemo to attack the cancer in her lymph nodes. Ã¢ÂÂMy life has been turned upside down,Ã¢ÂÂ she told The Post. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs been hard. Ã¢ÂÂ Shaw said her cancer is not terminal, but Ã¢ÂÂthere is a chance it may be terminal if some of the methods we have in place donÃ¢ÂÂt work. Ã¢ÂÂ In her most recent video, she sat at the foot of her bed, answering questions about her struggles and her future plans. She said that if and when her doctors clear her, she wants to get back to bodybuilding, repairing and restoring herself after her body was ravaged by disease. Ã¢ÂÂAfter cancer, I definitely plan on doing more competitions and continuing to build my body because, obviously, I donÃ¢ÂÂt like where itÃ¢ÂÂs at now,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂBut I love myself and I love my body because I truly believe that if my body wasnÃ¢ÂÂt where it was when I first began, I truly believe IÃ¢ÂÂd be a lot weaker than I am now. So definitely, bodybuilding has saved me. Ã¢ÂÂ",cancer,A 23-year-old bodybuilder is being ravaged by ovarian cancer Ã¢ÂÂ and Instagramming it all,2306.0,2306.0,306.0,

3409,"More than two million American men are currently living with prostate cancer, yet the national conversation about the disease consistently falls short. My colleague Dana Jennings, a writer and editor for The Times, was diagnosed with prostate cancer seven months ago. He has generously offered to share some of his experiences with the disease as a regular contributor to the Well blog.  By Dana Jennings  There is no such thing as a ""good cancer."" When my prostate cancer was diagnosed last April, I can't tell you how many well-meaning friends and acquaintances said: ""At least you have a good cancer."" What they were trying to say is that prostate cancer is often very treatable when detected in its early stages. Even so, nearly 30,000 American men died last year of ""the good cancer.""  (Photo: Dana Jennings. (Lonnie Schlein/The New York Times))   My cancer did appear to fall within the range of the ordinary. Treatment is still treatment, though, and a prostatectomy, no matter the method, is major surgery, with the twin shadows of impotence and incontinence always present.  But after my radical open prostatectomy on July 7, the pathology report revealed that my cancer wasn't so ordinary, after all, and showed what one doctor called a ""somewhat extraordinary scenario."" My apparently run-of-the-mill prostate cancer was actually an aggressive star among such cancers.  Rather than being a typically slow and pokey prostate cancer, mine had marched beyond the prostate and invaded a seminal vesicle and other tissue. It was a pure and aggressive prostate cancer. I soared from pre-surgery Gleason scores of 6 or 7 (two different hospitals, two different scores) to a Gleason of 9 — the higher the number on this scale of 10 the worse the news — and from having a probable Stage 1 cancer to a Stage 3: Stage T3B to be exact.  Some men with Gleason 9's do well, my doctors say, others don't. And even if I go into remission after my current treatment of hormonal therapy coupled with radiation, there's still a 50 percent chance that the cancer will return.  I'm 51 and married, have two sons (19 and 22), and I'm on the young side to have prostate cancer. If my cancer had been ""ordinary,"" if the prostate had been simply snipped out with only the usual complications (which are significant), I might not have felt compelled to write about it.   But I've been living with my cancer for more than seven months now, and have taken to regularly writing down my experiences and feelings about the disease in a journal to help me cope with — and try to understand — the very personal challenges it presents. Despite the prevalence of prostate cancer (nearly 200,000 new cases are diagnosed each year), I have found my diagnosis to be surprisingly isolating, partly because, in my view, the national conversation about prostate cancer is lacking. It dwells on statistics and treatment, and ignores deeper issues.  Doctors tend to default to mere competent professionalism, forgetting to talk directly to the scared flesh-and-blood man bearing the disease. Friends shift uncomfortably, turn squeamish, when the conversation turns to the most personal aspects of treatment, like sex, impotence and incontinence. And even men who have prostate cancer themselves, taking their cues from their doctors, I suspect, find it difficult to talk about. Instead, they sound as if they're spokesmen for their cancer, not men stricken with a serious disease.  In these posts I hope to provide an antidote to the averted eyes and the retreat into medical jargon that sometimes characterize talk about prostate cancer. Prostate cancer isn't just about surgery, treatment and survival — it's also about relationships, sex, self-esteem, embarrassment, hope and fear. By writing about my own experiences, I hope I can start a personal, honest and down-to-earth conversation about the disease — in all its bewildering sadness and, yes, in all its strange humor — with fellow prostate cancer patients, their caregivers and anyone else who is interested.   And I'll say this one more time: There is no such thing as a ""good cancer.""  Please join the discussion by posting your comment below. ",cancer,The Good Cancer?,3409.0,102.0,,

3423,"Last week, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) released its latest report on the state of the world's species. It makes for gloomy reading. Although there have been a few triumphs — species increasing their numbers thanks to conservation efforts — the general picture is one of decline. A quarter of all mammal species are now endangered, mostly because their habitat is disappearing. But of all the mammals now on the endangered list, from the fishing cat to the Caspian seal, the most startling is the Tasmanian devil.   (Photo: Tasmanian Devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) (Ian Waldie/Getty Images)) Tasmanian devils live on the island of (surprise!) Tasmania, off the south coast of Australia. They are marsupials: their young are born tiny (about a third of a gram — that's a hundredth of an ounce), then fed on milk and carried in a pouch. As adults, devils are thick-set, thuggish-looking animals, with massive teeth that they use to chomp up carcasses, bones and all. Although they are far from enormous — the biggest males weigh in at around 14 kilograms (30 pounds), about the size of a French bulldog — Tasmanian devils are the largest carnivorous marsupials to have, so far, escaped extinction.   But over the last 12 years, the population has crashed — in some areas, population numbers have fallen by 90 percent. The dramatic decline has led the IUCN to move the species from ""least concern"" a decade ago to ""endangered"" now. Some think it could be extinct within 25 years. The reason? An infectious cancer.  Some human cancers are infectious in the sense that they are caused by infectious viruses. Cervical cancer, for instance, is caused by human papilloma virus, which spreads from one person to another during sex.   But the cancer that's killing the Tasmanian devils is different. The cancer cells themselves are infectious.   Here's what happens. The cancer causes a tumor on the animal's face. If an infected animal bites another — which happens often, as devils are aggressive creatures, especially during the mating season — some of the tumor cells get transferred. These then start growing on the other animal. It's as though you kissed someone with throat cancer, and got their cancer yourself.  Which is pretty weird. Cancers are usually part of you, a group of your own cells that begin to grow out of control. Foreign cells — such as the ones that cause the devils' cancer — are normally rejected by the immune system. That's why organ transplants are difficult: the immune system immediately recognizes that the transplanted organ is not part of you, and begins attacking it. This happens unless there's a close match between the donor and the recipient at a set of genes known as the major histocompatibility locus, or MHC. If there is a match, you may be similar enough, genetically speaking, that the immune system doesn't notice the difference between the foreign organ and you. But unless you're having a transplant from a close relation, the odds of this are low. Human MHC genes are extremely variable. Most people who get organ transplants thus have to take drugs that suppress their immune system. Otherwise, the foreign organ gets attacked and destroyed.  So it's not surprising that most of the devil-style infectious cancers known in humans have happened when someone's immune system hasn't been working. Recipients of transplanted organs occasionally receive cancer cells as well; the drugs that prevent the immune system from destroying the organ also prevent it from destroying the foreign tumor. Because a baby's immune system doesn't get going until after it's born, a pregnant woman with cancer can infect her fetus. Likewise, if a mother is carrying several fetuses and one of them has a cancer, it can infect the others. But all these events are rare.  Even rarer are cases of direct transmission to someone whose immune system is robust. One example: a healthy surgeon injured his hand while operating on a cancer patient and contracted the patient's cancer. For reasons unknown, his immune system failed to respond. The resulting tumor was cut out, and the surgeon survived.  Tasmanian devils are not so lucky. Devil facial tumor disease, as it is known, kills within months. The tumor makes it hard for the animals to feed, so they starve.  The cancer has had a dramatic impact on their way of life. In the past, a female Tasmanian devil could expect to live to four or five. She'd start breeding at two, and have a litter every year. But in places where devil facial tumor disease has struck, life expectancy is short. Hardly any animals live beyond age three, and most females have only one chance to breed.   Interestingly, many females are now starting to breed in their first year. Although, before the disease, a few first-year females would manage to breed, most wouldn't. This has changed. In some populations, more than 80 percent of females are breeding in their first year. But in the absence of animals able to resist the disease, whether this will be enough to save the species from annihilation remains to be seen.  Why don't the devils reject the alien cells? There are two possibilities. The first is that the tumor somehow interferes with the immune response. (Many traditional tumors can do this.) The second is that the immune system fails to recognize the tumor as alien.   In the case of the devils, it seems to be the second. The animals don't have much genetic diversity at the MHC. So the immune system doesn't seem to be able to detect the invading cells because they're not different enough from the animal's own body. (Other animals with low MHC diversity, such as pocket gophers, can sometimes accept organ transplants from an unrelated member of their species.)   Tasmanian devils aren't the only animals to have a transmissible cancer. Dogs have one too. Theirs is transmitted during sex. Canine transmissible venereal tumor has been around for at least 200 years, and probably much longer. (The devils' disease, in contrast, was first spotted in 1996.) For dogs, the disease is rarely fatal. Instead, the tumor goes through an initial period of rapid growth, during which it manages to stop the dog's immune system from attacking it. But then, the immune system gets going, and kills the tumor. Having once been infected, a dog is resistant to the disease.   These cancers raise a number of questions. In particular: why aren't more cancers transmissible? After all, there are many, many types of cancer in many different species, but only two are known to spread from one animal to another. This suggests it isn't simply a matter of MHC diversity. After all, animals such as beavers and cheetahs have low diversity but no cancer; and the MHC situation of Tasmanian devils didn't suddenly change in the 1990s. Instead, it suggests that the cancer cells have to evolve in ways that makes them more likely to be transmissible. What those ways are, however, is a total mystery.  But if transmissible cancers have evolved twice, the odds are they can evolve again. The prospect is unnerving. (Even more unnerving is the idea that such cancers could be transmitted by mosquitoes, as was mooted for an infectious cancer said to be circulating among a species of hamster in the 1960s. Reports of this cancer are, however, absent from the recent scientific literature, and their significance is unclear.) Beavers and cheetahs, and other animals with low diversity at the MHC, could obviously be at risk of going the way of the devil, should a transmissible cancer evolve in these species.   What about us? Humans have lots of MHC diversity. But we have another risk factor. Owing to the failure to treat H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, in many parts of the world, large numbers of people have compromised immune systems. This is the sort of environment that could, perhaps, allow a transmissible cancer to evolve. Initially, it would circulate only among those who are immunocompromised. But, over time, it might evolve to infect healthy people too. It's an alarming thought — though happily, a thought is all it is. For now.  **********  NOTES:  For the state of mammals in this year's IUCN redlist, see here, and related links.   For general biology of Tasmanian devils, see pages 64-65 of Nowak, R. M. 1999.

Walmer was shocked by what he saw: Fertilien finishing a hysterectomy with the aid of a flashlight when the hospital generator failed to restart, for instance, or when an anesthesiologist wasn’t available for an emergency C-section, the doctor just numbing the skin and cutting.

This approach has been replaced by less extensive surgery that, through decades of clinical trials, has proved to be equally effective at treating patients, as well as safer and less disfiguring. Even simple mastectomies, in which most nodes and the muscles were left intact, have become far less common. Dr. J. Dirk Iglehart, director of the Susan F.

3511,"New York Times editor Dana Jennings writes each week about coping with an aggressive form of prostate cancer.  By Dana Jennings  (Photo: Dana Jennings. (Lonnie Schlein/The New York Times)) We are about to enter a holy few days for Jews and Christians. Passover starts at sundown tomorrow, and Easter is Sunday. But then again, when you're a cancer patient, each day is a holy day - no matter what your beliefs.   I converted to Judaism five years ago, after decades spent stumbling toward God. That faith has helped sustain me this past year, from the diagnosis of my prostate cancer, through surgery, and through radiation and hormone treatment when it was learned that I had an aggressive cancer.   I am not a fool. I am a patient with Stage T3B cancer and a Gleason score of 9. I need the skills and the insights of the nurses and doctors who care for me. But they don't treat the whole man. Medicine cares about physical outcomes, not the soul. I also need - even crave - the spiritual antibodies of prayer, song and sacred study.  And it's a powerful thing to know that others are praying for your return to health. My faith reminds me that I am not alone, that I am part of a larger whole, part of an ancient tradition and a timeless narrative. Disease often makes us feel cut off from community, even from ourselves, and faith helps defy that sense of isolation.  One of our cultural verities about serious illness is that it often challenges our faith. But for me, if anything, having cancer has only deepened it, heightened it.  I have spent the past year in the dark ark of cancer, and there is no question that I have become a new man. I've been granted a wisdom that only arrives at the rugged confluence of middle age and mortality. And I know, soul deep, that I have not been cut open, radiated, and tried physically and spiritually so that I can merely survive, become a cancer wraith. Since my diagnosis - after shaking off the initial shock - I have kept asking myself, in the context of my belief: What can this cancer teach me?   The most surprising thing I've learned is that cancer can be turned toward blessing. Through the simple fact of me telling my cancer stories on this blog, many of you readers, in turn, have told your own stories. And that mutual sharing of our tales has changed my life for the good.

3536,"People with more lean muscle mass may have an advantage when it comes to fighting cancer, new research suggests.  The study, published in the medical journal Lancet Oncology, is the latest to suggest a patient's body composition may play a role in cancer survival rates. Researchers from the University of Alberta used body scan imaging to study 250 obese cancer patients. The scans showed that 15 percent of the cancer patients had very low muscle mass relative to their weight.   The obese patients with the lower levels of lean muscle mass lived an average of 10 months less than patients with more muscle mass, even after controlling for other variables like cancer stage and severity.   Other studies have shown that people who exercise have lower rates of some types of cancer. Although the study suggests that higher levels of lean muscle mass help the body better cope with cancer, it's not clear whether lifting weights prior to or after a diagnosis would improve a patient's odds for surviving the disease. ""That would be the next experiment,'' said Dr. Vickie Baracos, a professor of oncology and adjunct professor of human nutrition at the University of Alberta, and lead author on the study. ""This intervention has not been tested.''  The data also raise questions about whether body composition should be considered as doctors make treatment decisions and assess a patient's prognosis. A patient with very low lean body mass, for instance, may be given a more tailored dose of chemotherapy, Dr. Baracos said.  Patients who have been treated for cancer should talk to their doctor before embarking on any exercise routine. For instance, patients who have undergone lymph node removal are at risk for a severe swelling disorder called lymphedema and may be advised against lifting weights.

3624,"Many people gobble big doses of vitamin C in hopes of boosting their immune system and warding off illness. But new research shows that in people with cancer, the vitamin may do more harm than good.  Researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York studied the effects of vitamin C on cancer cells. As it turns out, the vitamin seems to protect not just healthy cells, but cancer cells, too. The findings were published today in the journal Cancer Research.  ""The use of vitamin C supplements could have the potential to reduce the ability of patients to respond to therapy,"" said Dr. Mark Heaney, an associate attending physician at the cancer center.  Dr. Heaney and his colleagues tested five different chemotherapy drugs on cancer cells in the laboratory. Some of the cells were first treated with vitamin C. In every case, including a test of the powerful new cancer drug Gleevec, chemotherapy did not work as well if cells had been exposed to vitamin C. The chemotherapy agents killed 30 to 70 percent fewer cancer cells when the cells were treated with the vitamin.  A second set of experiments implanted cancer cells in mice. They found that the tumors grew more rapidly in mice that were given cancer cells pretreated with vitamin C.  The researchers found that just like healthy cells, cancer cells also benefit from vitamin C. The vitamin appeared to repair a cancer cell's damaged mitochondria, the energy center of cells. When the mitochondria is injured, it sends signals that force the cell to die, but vitamin C interrupts that process.  ""Vitamin C appears to protect the mitochondria from extensive damage, thus saving the cell,"" Dr. Heaney said. ""And whether directly or not, all anticancer drugs work to disrupt the mitochondria to push cell death.""  Dr. Heaney measured the buildup of vitamin C levels in cells and said that the levels of vitamin C used in the experiments were similar to those that would result if a patient took large doses of the vitamin in supplement form. Earlier research at the cancer center showed that vitamin C seems to accumulate within cancer cells more than in normal cells.  Patients should eat a healthy diet that includes foods rich in vitamin C, Dr. Heaney said, but it's the large doses of vitamin C in tablet form that are worrisome.

By Dana Jennings  Long before I started writing publicly about my prostate cancer, I wrote about it for myself.  (Photo: Dana Jennings. (Lonnie Schlein/The New York Times)) Since the mid-'90s, I've kept a journal, mainly to take my mental temperature, and as a hedge against forgetting. I'm one of those people who needs to explain himself to himself. I never truly know what I'm thinking until I'm hunched over a notebook, razor-point pen poised above a blank page.   I wrote my first journal entry about prostate cancer last March, when I learned I had a 50-50 chance of having the disease.  March 19: It makes no sense to freak out right now. And, to be honest, it makes no sense to freak out if I do have cancer.  Since then, my journal has been a record of my highs, lows and everything in between on the cancer road. I never imagined at the time that these very private thoughts would be made public. At first, I was still trying to figure out how to have cancer. I was stunned but trying to be a good stoic, as I'd been taught as a kid back home in New Hampshire.  April 9: I found out two days ago that I have prostate cancer. I'm not angry. I'm not sad. I'm not depressed -- it is what it is. … I wouldn't choose to have cancer, but it does represent the opportunity to engage in an unexpected and serious spiritual adventure.

3831,"The majority of people diagnosed with cancer are over 65, but most major cancer studies exclude them, leaving a wide gap in knowledge about how best to treat older patients.  The knowledge gap about older cancer patients was highlighted recently by researchers from Barcelona who studied the role that age played in the prognosis of 224 cancer patients.   According to the National Cancer Institute, 60 percent of newly diagnosed cancers are found in people over the age of 65. Overall, people in this age group are 10 times more likely to get cancer, and 15 times more likely to die from the disease, than are people under the age of 65.  But even though most cancer patients are older, age is typically not the deciding factor in whether someone survives the illness, the Spanish researchers showed. In their study, cancer survival was most affected by how much the cancer had spread at the time of diagnosis. Other issues, like the patient's overall quality of life, also influenced survival. The research was published this month in The International Journal of Clinical Practice.  ""We found that there were a number of factors that influence survival rates -- including physical quality of life and how far the cancer had spread -- but age was not one of them"" said lead researcher Dr. Eva Domingo from Hospital Vall d'Hebron, in a press release. ""Despite this fact, and the challenges that clinicians face from an aging population, there has been little research into how to treat older cancer patients, who often have complex medical needs because of other health issues.''  Dr. Domingo notes that older people are ""systematically excluded"" from many clinical trials. Among cancer patients who participate in clinical trials, only about one in four is over 65, she said.  As a result, doctors know very little about how drug therapies affect older patients. In addition, many doctors lean toward less aggressive treatment for older patients, based on the fact that they have shorter life expectancies or other health problems. But the Barcelona researchers found that whether a person has a high quality of life and functions well are more predictive of cancer survival than issues associated with normal aging.  ""Older people tend to have more complex health needs, such as other illnesses, and that is one of the reasons that has frequently been put forward for not treating their cancers aggressively,'' Dr. Domingo noted. But those factors were ""much less significant'' than factors like quality of life for predicting survival, she said.  ""We would like to see fewer decisions taken on the basis of age and more research that explores the complex needs of older people, so that they can be treated more effectively and enjoy a better quality of life,"" Dr. Domingo said.

3876,"The head of a prominent cancer research institute has warned his faculty and staff to limit cellphone use because of a possible cancer risk, The Associated Press reports.  Dr. Ronald B. Herberman, the director of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, notes that while the evidence about a cellphone-cancer link remains unclear, people should take precautions, particularly for children.  ""Really at the heart of my concern is that we shouldn't wait for a definitive study to come out, but err on the side of being safe rather than sorry later,"" Dr. Herberman told The Associated Press.  Earlier this year, three prominent brain surgeons raised similar concerns while speaking on ""The Larry King Show."" Their concerns were largely based on observational studies that showed only an association between cellphone use and cancer, not a causal relationship. The most important of these studies is called Interphone, a vast research effort in 13 countries, including Canada, Israel and several in Europe.  Some of the research suggests a link between cellphone use and three types of tumors: glioma; cancer of the parotid, a salivary gland near the ear; and acoustic neuroma, a tumor that essentially occurs where the ear meets the brain. All these tumors are rare, so even if cellphone use does increase risk, the risk is still very low.  On Wednesday, Dr. Herberman sent a memo to about 3,000 faculty and staff saying that children should use cellphones only for emergencies because their brains are still developing. He advised adults to keep cellphones away from the head and use the speakerphone or a wireless headset, he said.  ""Although the evidence is still controversial, I am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cellphone use,"" he wrote in his memo.

3903,"Every week, New York Times editor Dana Jennings shares his experiences coping with prostate cancer.   By Dana Jennings   (Photo: Dana Jennings. (Lonnie Schlein/The New York Times))  Prostate cancer is a dark waltz, not the raging battle of popular imagination. From that first elevated PSA blood test, to the biopsy, to treatment, to those evil twins of impotence and incontinence and beyond, I'm still learning some very complicated steps more than seven months after my diagnosis.   Cancer is a hard teacher. No matter how much you glean from the Web, how many fellow travelers you talk to, how many questions you ask nurses and doctors, there are some lessons — physical, practical, emotional — that can only be learned firsthand.   I confess that I feel utterly vulnerable. But, as the poet Theodore Roethke wrote, ""Those who are willing to be vulnerable move among the mysteries."" So, as I continue to move among these mysteries, here are 10 nuggets of prostate cancer wisdom that I had to learn for myself.   1) Cancer takes you home. The hardest thing I've had to do since my diagnosis — and that includes having my radical open prostatectomy — was tell my parents that I had prostate cancer. My folks are working-class country people. They're both 68, and they were 17 when I was born in 1957 — eight days after they got married. The three of us, literally, grew up together, and I've always been their little hyper-verbal mystery. They never quite understood why I needed to get the hell out of Kingston, N.H. And when I called them last April to say that I had cancer — maybe, after all these years, confirming their worst fears about life in and around New York City — I could barely speak for my fierce tears. Tears more for them, I know, than for me.   2) Doctors forget to share the gory details. After my prostate was removed, my testicles swelled to the size of shot-puts — bright, red shot-puts — and stayed that way for days. Nobody told me to expect this condition, and only ice brought relief. (Conversely, now that I'm undergoing hormonal therapy, my testicles are shrinking.)   3) Insurance can cause more stress than cancer. The goal of your insurer — no matter how singular or complex your case is — is to try to turn you into a statistical cliché, a cipher, in the face of your very human flesh-and-blood disease. In the months after my diagnosis, as my wife and I struggled to find the right pair of highly-skilled hands to perform my potentially difficult surgery, wrestling with my insurer caused me more grief, stress and depression than my cancer did. In our modern health-care-industrial-complex — and I'm talking about the bureaucrats who try to herd you into the cheapest cattle car available, not the nurses and doctors who are on the front lines — the emphasis is neither on health nor care, but on the bottom line. It's our job, as patients, to resist with all our strength.   Prostate Cancer Journal  One Man's Story ",cancer,10 Lessons of Prostate Cancer,3903.0,596.0,,

3916,"Last year, 218,000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer, but nobody can tell them what type of treatment is most likely to save their lives.  Those are the findings of a troubling new report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which analyzed hundreds of studies in an effort to advise men about the best treatments for prostate cancer. The report compared the effectiveness and risks of eight prostate cancer treatments, ranging from prostate removal to radioactive implants to no treatment at all. None of the studies provided definitive answers. Surprisingly, no single treatment emerged as superior to doing nothing at all.  ""When it comes to prostate cancer, we have much to learn about which treatments work best,'' said agency director Carolyn M. Clancy. ""Patients should be informed about the benefits and harms of treatment options.""  But the study, published online in the Annals of Internal Medicine, gives men very little guidance. Prostate cancer is typically a slow-growing cancer, and many men can live with it for years, often dying of another cause. But some men have aggressive prostate cancers, and last year 27,050 men died from the disease. The lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer has nearly doubled to 20 percent since the late 1980s, due mostly to expanded use of the prostate-specific antigen, or P.S.A., blood test. But the risk of dying of prostate cancer remains about 3 percent. ""Considerable overdetection and overtreatment may exist,'' an agency press release stated.   The agency review is based on analysis of 592 published articles of various treatment strategies. The studies looked at treatments that use rapid freezing and thawing (cryotherapy); minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopic or robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy); testicle removal or hormone therapy (androgen deprivation therapy); and high-intensity ultrasound or radiation therapy. The study also evaluated research on ""watchful waiting,'' which means monitoring the cancer and initiating treatment only if it appears the disease is progressing.  No one treatment emerged as the best option for prolonging life. And it was impossible to determine whether one treatment had fewer or less severe side effects.  Many of the treatments now in widespread use have never been evaluated in randomized controlled trials. In the research that is available, the characteristics of the men studied varied widely. And investigators used different definitions and methods, making reliable comparisons across studies impossible.   ""Investigators' definitions of adverse events and criteria to define event severity varied widely,'' the report notes. ""We could not derive precise estimates of specific adverse events for each treatment.''  The report findings highlighted by the agency include:   All active treatments cause health problems, primarily urinary incontinence, bowel problems and erectile dysfunction. The chances of bowel problems or sexual dysfunction are similar for surgery and external radiation. Leaking of urine is at least six times more likely among surgery patients than those treated by external radiation.   Urinary leakage that occurs daily or more often was more common in men undergoing radical prostatectomy (35 percent) than external-beam radiation therapy (12 percent) or androgen deprivation (11 percent). Those were the findings of the 2003 Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study, a large, nationally representative survey of men with early prostate cancer.   External-beam radiation therapy and androgen deprivation were each associated with a higher frequency of bowel urgency (3 percent) compared with radical prostatectomy (1 percent), according to the 2003 report.    Inability to attain an erection was higher in men undergoing active intervention, especially androgen deprivation (86 percent) or radical prostatectomy (58 percent) than in men receiving watchful waiting (33 percent), according to the 2003 report.   One study showed that men who choose surgery over watchful waiting are less likely to die or have their cancer spread, but another study found no difference in survival between surgery and watchful waiting. The benefit, if any, appears to be limited to men under 65. However, few patients in the study had cancer detected through P.S.A. tests. As a result, it's not clear if the results are applicable to the majority of men diagnosed with the disease.   Adding hormone therapy prior to prostate removal does not improve survival or decrease recurrence rates, but it does increase the chance of adverse events.   Combining radiation with hormone therapy may decrease mortality. But compared with radiation treatment alone, the combination increases the chances of impotence and abnormal breast development.  The most obvious trend identified in the complicated report is how little quality research exists for prostate cancer, despite the fact that it is the most diagnosed cancer in the country.  Studies comparing brachytherapy, radical prostatectomy, external-beam radiation therapy or cryotherapy were discontinued because of poor recruitment. Two ongoing trials, one in the United States and one in Britain, are evaluating surgery and radiation treatments compared with watchful waiting in men with early cancer. Other studies in progress or development include cryotherapy versus external-beam radiation and a trial evaluating radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting.   ""Successful completion of these studies is needed to provide accurate assessment of the comparative effectiveness and harms of therapies for localized prostate cancers,"" the study authors said.

But experts say this rumor is supported by only weak evidence and should be disregarded. Last year, a European study found that frequent use of antiperspirants was linked to earlier onset of breast cancer in 437 women. But the study did not include a control group. And a far more scientifically rigorous study of 1,500 women, published a year later in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute, found no relationship at all. A 2003 study, published in The Journal of Applied Toxicology, found that samples from 20 different breast tumors contained trace amounts of parabens, chemicals that are used in most antiperspirants and that mimic estrogen, which can stimulate breast tumors. But Dr. Michael Thun of the American Cancer Society said that parabens cannot be linked to cancer because they block hormone receptors and actually decrease estrogenic activity in the breasts.

3987,"(Photo: Dana with his wife, Deb.)   Times editor Dana Jennings writes each week about his experiences coping with an aggressive form of prostate cancer.   (Photo: Dana Jennings.

These days, I epitomize the ""in sickness"" part of the wedding vows that Deb and I took back in 1981.

Most nights, I'm in bed by 10. The Lupron hormone shots, which suppress the testosterone that can fuel prostate cancer, have sent my sex drive lower than the stock market, shrunken my testicles, and given me hot flashes so fierce that I sweat outdoors when it's 20 degrees and snowing.

3989,"Times editor Dana Jennings writes each week about coping with an advanced form of prostate cancer.  By Dana Jennings  I'm tired.   I found out 10 months ago that I had prostate cancer. Since then, I've had surgery, started hormone therapy and finished 33 sessions of radiation. And, man, it wears you out.   (Photo: Dana Jennings. (Lonnie Schlein/The New York Times))   But the weariness caused by prostate cancer isn't a constant. It fluctuates from week to week, day to day, even hour to hour. In this nano-age of super-instant gratification, we have lost sense of organic time. Prostate cancer, though, has planted me more firmly in each moment. One of the things that I've learned, as I try to pay attention, is that cancer's paint box includes many shades of fatigue.   It starts with the diagnosis. Knowing that you have cancer exhausts you, stuns you into listlessness. Even so, there's work to be done. There are doctors to be interrogated, a host of tests and scans to be had, treatment decisions to wrestle with and insurers to kick in the shins. With all that going on, it's hard to get a good night's sleep.   Next there's the physical fatigue of treatment. I spent three nights in the hospital after my surgery, and that was the time I experienced fatigue that's beyond fatigue, a fatigue so palpable it seems you could touch it. I wanted to shrivel into the fetal curl of a woolly-bear caterpillar, spin a cocoon of sleep and tell my doctors to wake me when it was time to leave. I learned that sleep is bliss, that sleep heals, that sleep is the essential post-op drug.   At home, I had to accept that my fatigue was in charge. Mornings were especially slow as I creaked and winced out of bed. I felt like an old car that needed to have its crankcase oil heated before it would start.   I soon learned that just shuffling around the block can be draining, that there's power in the spontaneous nap, and that you need to set strict visiting hours. Your fatigue – your body – needs what it needs.   But just because you're spent, it doesn't mean you can sleep at night. I became buddies with the sleep that isn't sleep, staked to my bed by pain and anxiety. No matter where I tucked the pillows, I couldn't get comfortable. No matter how good the music murmuring from the CD player, I couldn't be soothed. (Is that a blood clot floating in my catheter tube?)  A prescription sleeping pill helped solve those problems. For the sake of my wife's repose (and sanity), we decided to sleep in separate beds for two weeks, until I felt better and the catheter was out.   I also dozed off where I least expected to. During radiation, I sometimes napped inside the TomoTherapy machine, lulled in my lassitude by Pink Floyd and Metallica. It was the radiation, which lasted more than seven weeks, that resulted in the most profound fatigue.   Toward the end, I was totally washed out. I felt worn down, like a pencil nub that couldn't possibly be sharpened one more time. It was hard to focus – on reading, on work – I wasn't listening as well, my legs were heavy. It took just one stout with supper to knock me out for the night.   Even now, a month after my last radiation session, the fatigue still swells late in the afternoon and breaks over me. When 5 o'clock rolls around I'm more zombie than employee. I'm in bed by 10 most nights. And weekend naps are nonnegotiable.   There's one more subtle shade of fatigue: the fatigue of talking about your cancer. From the diagnosis, through treatment and after, the well-meaning questions seem to never stop. How are you feeling? What's your Gleason? Where's your P.S.A.? Will you need chemo?   It sometimes feels as if you have become your cancer or, at the very least, its spokesman. And it can be wearing. But I found that it's crucial to shake off that languor and learn to speak. Sleep heals, but talking heals, too.   Like Scheherazade and her 1,001 nights of stories, I think we tell our tales so that we, and others, can stay alive -- no matter how tired we might get.

4068,"A particularly fast-growing form of breast cancer should be treated aggressively after surgery even when tumors are very small, according to new research that could dramatically alter treatment for one in five women diagnosed with breast cancer.  The research, reported on Friday at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, focuses on the 15 percent to 20 percent of women with breast cancer who test positive for an amplification of the HER2 gene, which is typically among the most aggressive forms of the disease.  Today, a targeted therapy called Herceptin, made by biotech firm Genentech, has greatly improved the odds for women with HER2-positive cancer. Recent studies show the drug reduces the recurrence of these cancers by about half.   But current treatment guidelines do not recommend that the drug be given to women with HER2-positive tumors less than one-half centimeter in size. The guidelines also suggest only that doctors discuss Herceptin treatment with women who have tumors between one-half and one centimeter in size.  The latest study finds that women with early-stage small tumors may have much to gain from aggressive treatment. Researchers at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center reviewed data from 965 women treated between 1990 and 2002 who had tumors less than one centimeter in size. They also studied 350 patients from European institutions.  They found that after five years, 23 percent of women with very small HER2-positive tumors experienced a return of the cancer, compared to just 6 percent of similar women without HER2 disease. That finding indicates that even among women who catch their cancers early, the risk of recurrence is nearly three times greater if they test positive for HER2 than if they do not. None of the women in the study received Herceptin treatment.  Although the data on recurrence strongly suggest that women with early-stage HER2-positive cancer could benefit from aggressive treatment, the study did not study the effectiveness of Herceptin in women with small tumors. Women with small but aggressive tumors should be included in clinical trials comparing current practices with more aggressive treatment, said Dr. Ana M. Gonzalez-Angulo, assistant professor at M.D. Anderson.  Herceptin is a so-called targeted therapy because it attacks particular mechanisms used by tumors to grow or survive. The drug binds to the HER-2 protein and prevents it from being activated. Treatment with Herceptin carries some risks, however, and there are no meaningful data to help women with early-stage disease weigh the risks against the benefits of using the drug.   Herceptin causes flu-like symptoms in about 40 percent of the patients who take it. Of more concern is the fact that Herceptin can damage the heart, and on rare occasions patients who have used the drug experience life-threatening congestive heart failure or stroke.  The study was funded by a grant from the National Cancer Institute. ",cancer,New Research on Breast Cancer Treatment,4068.0,761.0,,

4189," (Photo:  One of Cordula Volkening's works. )   A former art student, 52-year-old Cordula Volkening channeled her creativity into an interior design business. But a diagnosis of terminal brain cancer reignited her passion for art.  My colleague Corey Kilgannon recently profiled Ms. Volkening's artistic journey through cancer. She began sketching in the hospital about 18 months ago. Ms. Volkening has stopped medical treatment, after being told that it would give her some more time but leave her too weak to paint.  So she spends her remaining time in a comfortable chair by a window at the studio. She painted years ago but with more mental interference, she said, making it more of an ""intellectual pursuit"" than the urgent, spontaneous process it is now. Now the brush itself seems to decide what to paint.  ""I paint what comes out,"" she said. ""It's not intellectual — it's instinctive.""  She paints rapidly, and her images are primal and powerful. There are insistent brush strokes, bold colors and bleak backgrounds. There are faces laughing and others cringing. There are winged characters flying into the beyond. There are people hugging each other. Different as they are, she said, they all reflect aspects of her condition....  She said her painting style is shaped by one thing: ""I have nothing to lose.""

4262,"A man's risk for prostate cancer appears to increase with his height, a new study shows.  Height appears to play less of a role than other known prostate cancer risk factors like age, family history and race. As a result, men shouldn't make screening or treatment decisions based on their height. But the findings may open up a new line of scientific inquiry into the causes of prostate cancer.  Researchers from four universities in England studied more than 9,000 men with and without prostate cancer and found that the tallest men had a 19 percent higher risk of developing prostate cancer than shorter men. Using the shortest men as a baseline, the study showed that risk increased 6 percent for every additional 4 inches in height. The report, published in the September issue of Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, showed an even stronger association between height and aggressive cancers.  ""Compared to other risk factors, the magnitude of the additional risk of being taller is small, and we do not believe that it should interfere with preventive or clinical decisions in managing prostate cancer,"" said the study's lead author, Luisa Zuccolo, of the department of social medicine at the University of Bristol. ""But the insight arising from this research is of great scientific interest.''  The increased risk likely is explained by factors associated with height, such as the insulin-like growth factor-1 system, which stimulates cell growth and has been shown to be involved in prostate cancer incidence and progression. The researchers also analyzed 58 other studies and found evidence that greater stature is associated with a modest increase in prostate cancer risk.  A woman's height also is associated with breast cancer risk. Women who are 5-feet-9 or taller have a small increase in risk of both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer compared to women 5-feet-3 or shorter.

4287,"(Photo: Joseph Ho/Guardian Protesters at the University of California, San Diego, are lobbying school administrators to address a ""cancer cluster"" linked to a campus building.)   A building on the University of California, San Diego, campus is being blamed for a cluster of breast cancer cases, raising new questions about the risks of exposure to electromagnetic fields.  Last week, students and professors marched and carried signs to protest what they called a ""crisis of safety,'' claiming that the university has failed to address worries that the campus literature building is the site of an inordinate number of cancer cases. The protesters delivered a petition signed by more than 1,300 people to the university chancellor, Marye Anne Fox, according to a report in the university's newspaper, The Guardian.   At least eight workers in the campus building have been diagnosed with breast cancer since 2000, and a handful of other cancers, including ovarian and salivary gland cancers, have also been reported. The number of breast cancer cases alone is significantly more than would have been expected by chance, according to a June analysis by Cedric Garland, an epidemiologist at the university. In that report, he notes that the risk of invasive breast cancer for employees in the literature building appears to be four to five times higher than that of the general California population. To read the full report, click here.  Building workers and researchers are concerned the source of the problem may be the building's elevators, which rest on the first floor and emit an electromagnetic field. According to the report from Dr. Garland:  The issue of the etiological role of EMF in breast cancer is still not resolved with final scientific certainty, despite decades of research. However, the lack of such certainty should not be a reason to avoid taking moderate measures to minimize needless exposure of workers to power frequency EMF.  According to The Guardian, the University ""has vacated areas with risk of exposure to high EMF levels"" and replaced elevator motor devices and other fixtures to reduce generation of electromagnetic fields. A University of California, Los Angeles, researcher, Leeka Kheifets, has been asked to continue the investigation, although critics are wary of her ties to the Electric Power Research Institute, an arm of the electric utility industry, according to a report in Microwave News.   The university has created a Web site where it summarizes the literature building study as well as the interim safety measures it has taken, as well as links to scientific literature on electromagnetic fields and cancer. Click here to see the site.   In 2003, scientists reported that they found no link between a much publicized breast cancer cluster on Long Island and exposure to electromagnetic fields.

4583,"Hormone therapy to shrink or slow the growth of prostate cancer is one of the most common treatments for the disease. New York Times editor Dana Jennings, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier this year, talks about his own treatment with the drug Lupron.  By Dana Jennings   The day after my most recent hormone injection for prostate cancer, I told my wife, Deb, that I had a headache, hot flashes, cramps and was very, very hungry.  (Photo: Dana Jennings. (Lonnie Schlein/The New York Times))   She said, ""Sweetie, you're having your period."" We both laughed. (Laughter is a crucial therapy in my treatment.)   Those are just a few of the side effects I've been experiencing on Lupron, which is part of the hormonal treatment for my advanced case of prostate cancer. Lupron is a testosterone suppressant, designed to starve hormone-dependent cancer cells of the fuel (testosterone) that they crave in order to grow. My doctors believe, and studies indicate, that using hormonal therapy to complement my radiation treatments, which are scheduled to start next month, will give me a better chance of being cured, of survival.   In the past couple weeks, I've also had back, joint and muscle aches, random itchiness: that spider-crawling-on-your-skin feeling, cotton mouth, sudden fatigue and fleeting bursts of pain in my jaw, chest and armpits. These are not complaints, just observations.   Oh, and my testicles are shrinking. There's also intermittent testicle tenderness and, sometimes, they get so warm they feel as if they're on simmer. And the most unexpected side effect, so far, is that sometimes during sex, a Lupron headache suddenly descends and hammers at my skull.   Essentially, my Lupron shots are inducing biochemical (but reversible) castration. Besides the hot flashes and shrinking testicles, another potential side effect is that a man's breasts grow larger and more sensitive. Now, I'll tell you straight up, no doctor ever sits you down and says, ""Son, to cure you, we might have to kind of turn you into a woman."" I suspect that some men would almost rather die than have hot flashes and larger breasts.    Prostate Cancer Journal  One Man's Story ",cancer,Real Men Get Prostate Cancer,4583.0,1276.0,,

Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democrat of Florida, kicked off a breast cancer awareness campaign today with disclosures of her own that hadn't been widely known before now.  The congresswoman revealed over the weekend that for the last year, she had battled breast cancer and had undergone seven major surgeries, including a double mastectomy and removal of her ovaries, all without skipping most beats on Capitol Hill or public events at home during her re-election in campaign. She disclosed her battle -- including her decisions to have such cancer-prone areas removed because of a genetic predisposition -- to the Miami Herald on Saturday, and during an interview this morning on ABC's ""Good Morning America.""  Ms. Wasserman Schultz, who is in her early 40s, said she didn't release the news publicly for a few reasons. ""I really wanted to make sure that I could protect my children; they were 8 and 4,"" she said in the interview She has twins who are now 9.    Elected to her third term while she was privately dealing with the illness and surgeries, she also didn't want her identifying ""tag line"" to be ""congresswoman battling breast cancer,"" she said. Much of her surgery was scheduled during congressional breaks, she said in the interviews, indicating that she's well now but would be taking Tamoxifen for several years.   Rather, she waited until just before rolling out her initiative today to promote an educational campaign aimed at younger women, in their 20s and 30s, in an effort to counter the prevailing 40-plus emphasis on when to get mammograms regularly. Younger women tend to think they're invincible, she said, so she hopes that she can push for legislation that would enhance knowledge among younger women, too. ",cancer,Fla.

4688,"This week, Dr. John Mulhall, director of the Male Sexual and Reproductive Medicine Program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, has been taking questions on the Well blog about what to expect following treatment for prostate cancer. Today, Dr. Mulhall, author of Saving Your Sex Life: A Guide for Men With Prostate Cancer, answers questions about exploring treatment options, effects of treatment on erectile function and penile rehabilitation after cancer treatments. Next week, Dr. Mulhall will answer questions about testosterone, alternative remedies and implants, and other treatments to restore sexual function.  My husband was just diagnosed with prostate cancer today. His cancer is localized in the prostate and his Gleason score is low. He is 63. What course of treatment do you recommend? -- Naomi  The vast majority of men, when they are diagnosed with prostate cancer, have Gleason scores of 5, 6 or 7. Scores of 8, 9 and 10 are aggressive, but if you have a score of 7 or less, you have time -- months -- to make your decision. You do not need to be wracked with fear.   There are some key messages we need to transmit to patients, one of which is to start looking at medical evidence. If you go to a surgeon, he will almost certainly recommend having the prostate removed. If you see a radiation oncologist, you'll most likely be offered radiation. So, it's difficult for patients to sift through the data.   My recommendation is to sit down and talk to more than one surgeon and more than one radiation oncologist. If you're on the fence and can't make a decision, go see somebody like me or an oncologist who specializes in prostate cancer -- someone who doesn't do the surgery and who doesn't do the radiation. That person can give you a rational approach for how you should look at that data.    Why don't we hear more about proton therapy as a treatment for prostate cancer? -- Teresa  I have heard a lot of advertising about a treatment device called the CyberKnife. Should a patient consider this alternative? -- John  Proton beam therapy and CyberKnife are both forms of radiation therapy. There is absolutely no evidence that erection function is better when patients have proton therapy or Cyberknife compared to standard radiation approaches like seed implantation (brachytherapy) or external beam radiation (3D-CRT or IMRT).   There is a lot of marketing going on. A good radiation oncologist combined with modern technology is what will get you the best result. Furthermore, there is no evidence that robotic prostatectomy has better outcomes than open prostatectomy. American men appear enthralled with gadgetry. They think lasers must be better and that using a robot must be better than standard surgery.   Choose your surgeon, not the approach he or she uses. There is no doubt the figures on hospital stay, blood loss and return to work are better for robotic prostatectomy, but at this time there is no evidence that robotic prostatectomy has better outcomes for erectile function or urinary function than open surgery.  What I tell patients who come to see me who are trying to decide between surgery and radiation is as follows: If you look at the data at three years after treatment, surgery or radiation, based on available evidence, there appears to be no significant difference in erectile dysfunction (ED) rates between the two. After surgery, virtually everyone has significant erectile dysfunction for the first 6 to 12 months. Then it improves. After radiation, very few men have ED in the first year, then between years one and three there is likely to be a reduction in erectile function. At about three years, both treatments have approximately the same rates of ED.  The key factors for patients to appreciate are to find physicians who have a high volume of procedures, and a surgeon or radiation oncologist who has been doing this for a while. Outcomes after radical prostatectomy, for example, are better when a surgeon has done 250 procedures and is likely doing more than 50 per year. Experience is important. Of note, surgeons who used to do open prostatectomy and who now do robotic surgery reset the clock, that is, their learning curve starts from close to zero again. So, if a surgeon experienced in open surgery starts to do robotic surgery it may take him or her more than 100 cases to get to the same level of expertise that he or she had when doing open surgery.    My husband had Robot Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy in February and is using Viagra on nights he does not use injections. I can't understand why, when drugs like Viagra are prescribed post-prostatectomy, prescription insurance plans refuse to pay for the drugs. -- G.H.  The evidence shows that the concept called penile rehabilitation provides some benefit to the recovery of erectile function. This approach involves the use of medications (pills or injections) to increase blood flow and oxygen going into the penis. Oxygen is critically important for the health of erectile tissue. When you're not getting erections, you're not oxygenating the penis and not preserving erectile tissue health.   As men, we get three erections every night of our lives before surgery. After surgery, this is not the case for at least the first year. You should think of your penis like you would your biceps. It's predominantly a muscle. If you're not using it, atrophy may occur, and atrophy in the penis is a permanent problem. There is evidence that half of men who go a year without any erection have irreversible structural damage to their erectile tissue.   The vast majority of urologists are doing penile rehabilitation in some form or fashion. Insurance coverage is a huge problem. The general figures are that about one third of men have coverage for Viagra -- the average number of pills per month is six. One-third have no coverage, and one-third have minimal coverage where they have to pay most of the cost of the drug anyway. Men using the drugs for penile rehabilitation use 10 to 15 pills per month.  I would encourage patients to be proactive before surgery or radiation and ask their doctors about rehabilitation and erectile tissue preservation. Before your treatment, set up a plan for how you are going to do rehab. We now start treating patients before surgery and before radiation.    I understand the doctor's foremost goal is to cure you of cancer. My question is, why are doctors so loathe to discuss the virtually inevitable changes in sexual abilities post cancer treatment? I personally found it was one of the larger black-holes of information from my medical professionals. I had to become educated by my own personal experiences over time -- Thomas  Most physicians want to help their patients. They want to do the right thing. However, most physicians are pretty uncomfortable talking about sexual problems. On average, there are less than one to two hours of sexual health education in most medical schools in the United States.   Another problem is many physicians use ""ballpark"" figures based on data in the literature from major centers. And so they say, ""We know 90 percent of men retain erectile function.'' But that's only true in very select centers and certain men.   I would say to any patient or partner who speaks to a physician who is evasive about the data on urinary function and sexual function: they are not a good match for you. That's a warning sign you should be seeking another opinion.   Do you think pretreatment counseling about erectile dysfunction would ease the potential sexual/relationship problems that may arise as a consequence of having radical prostatectomy? -- Leah  Unquestionably. I don't think patients necessarily have to see a mental health professional, but what patients need are realistic expectations.   One of the travesties I see in my practice is patients aren't given realistic expectations. Many patients are told that ""in six months, you'll be fine."" But if you're been told it will be six months, and you get to month nine and you're not functioning, you get depressed and a sense of hopelessness sets in. For a man, when his erections aren't working, he becomes avoidant of all physical contact. Many wives say, ""He doesn't even hold my hand. He doesn't even sit on the couch with me anymore.'' And so, there is an interruption in the couple's physical intimacy, which if it lasts for a prolonged period of time may be difficult to reestablish.  It's important for doctors to have a conversation up-front with people, informing them that it could take 18 to 24 months after prostatectomy to return to normal function or that it may take three-plus years after radiation before maximum erectile dysfunction is experienced. There are things we can do, but it may take time for erections to come back.   Another thing that is important for the prostatectomy patient to know: one in four men we see are not aware that they will never ejaculate after surgery, again highlighting the reticence of many physicians to discuss sexual issues.

4737,"Hamilton Jordan, the former White House chief of staff for President Jimmy Carter, was a well-known force in the health community. During the past 24 years he battled four different forms of cancer and urged cancer patients to empower themselves with information.  (Photo: Hamilton Jordan, left, walked the White House grounds with President Jimmy Carter in this undated photo. (Ruth Fremson/The New York Times))   After bouts with non-Hodgkins lymphoma, prostate cancer and skin cancer, Mr. Jordan, 63, yesterday died as a result of mesothelioma, another form of cancer. Mr. Jordan often speculated that his lymphoma may have resulted from exposure to the chemical Agent Orange while serving as a volunteer during the Vietnam War. Mesothelioma also has been linked to the chemical.  In his 2001 memoir, ""No Such Thing as a Bad Day,'' Mr. Jordan outlined his ""Top 10 Tips for Cancer Patients.'' He spoke about them during this undated interview with WebMD. Here they are:  No. 1: Be an active partner in the medical decisions that are made about your life.   Don't be passive. Learn about your disease, and participate in the decisions that are made....For example with my lymphoma, if I would have accepted the first treatment offered, I'd be dead today. It was assumed that I only had a mass in my chest. I later learned that the lymphoma was all through my body.    No. 2: Seek and know the truth about your illness, and prognosis.    If you don't have the facts, and don't know the truth, you won't make good decisions. It takes courage to ask questions about statistics and your prognosis.     No. 3: Get a second opinion.     We wouldn't buy the first computer or cellphone we looked at. Shop around when your life is at stake....I got second opinions on all of my cancers.    No. 4: Determine upfront how broad or narrow your physicians' experience is.    If you have something that your doctor says, ""I've never seen this before,"" get another doctor. You want your doctor to be very familiar with your disease.    No. 5: If you have a poor prognosis, or a rare form of cancer, try to get to a center of excellence.    If your doctor doesn't believe he or she can cure you, you won't believe you'll be cured.     No. 6: Do not allow your caregivers to project their values, goals and expectations onto you.    In my book I tell the story of a 68-year-old man who was diagnosed with PCa (prostate cancer). And this man is in very good health other than the PCa. His 35-year-old doctor reasoned that since his life expectancy was only five or six years, that he recommended that the man do nothing for his PCa and told him it would take the PCa four or five years to kill him. This man wanted to live to be 80 or 85. He didn't accept that. He had his prostate removed, and many years later he's in good health, and probably will live to be 80 or 85. Don't let your doctor project his or her expectations in life out on you.    No. 7: Understand the economics of cancer care.    You don't want to be in a situation where your doctor wants to run a $150 test that your insurance doesn't cover, but it contains critical information for making your diagnosis or deciding treatment. You need to understand what your insurance covers, and let your doctor know what you're willing to do to supplement that coverage to get a good diagnosis, and the best possible treatment. If your doctor says that he wants to run another test, but insurance won't pay for it, find out what it is. Why does he want to run it? Find out the cost, and determine whether you should pay it yourself. It might save your life.    No. 8: Ultimately, find a doctor that you trust and believe in.    Find a doctor with a fighting spirit, and who thinks that they can cure you. You tend to find doctors that reflect your own attitude. I always found doctors that liked the fact I was aggressive and going to fight for my life. They didn't object to my asking a lot of questions.    No. 9: Treat your mind as well as your body.    Just because we can't quantify, and don't understand the power of the mind, to deal with disease, it doesn't mean that attitude and the will to live is not a powerful, powerful force in the course of an illness.    No. 10: Your attitude and beliefs are your most powerful weapon against cancer.     I believe that deeply. There have been studies that show when you are happy and engaged and positive, your immune system is at its strongest. When you are depressed or unhappy, your immune system is weakened.

4740,"(Photo: A standard mammogram, left, and molecular breast imaging (M.B.I.), right, of a patient's dense breast tissue. A tumor is visible on the M.B.I., as in indicated by the arrow, but not on the mammogram. (AP))   Two big developments in breast cancer research are making headlines and generating buzz among scientists: one a new diagnostic option, the second a potential way to reduce the time patients must spend in radiation treatment. Each is promising, but there are some important points that are not yet clear.  Let's start with diagnosis. The problem with diagnosing breast cancer as early as possible is that the breast itself is not a completely uniform structure. It has several components -- fat, fibers, ducts and water, among them -- that give it a rather complex appearance when viewed by mammography (x-rays of the breast), ultrasound or MRI scans. Tumors also vary in appearance, some of them closely resembling normal breast tissue.  Diagnosing breast cancer becomes particularly difficult when the tumor is small or when the breast tissue itself is very variable in its consistency. It can be surprisingly difficult for a physician to decide whether a particular area with an ""odd"" appearance represents tumor, scar tissue, fat or something else.  New technology, called molecular breast imaging, appears to detect some tumors that were previously unseen. With this technique, small breast cancers absorb a type of radioactive molecule that can then be detected by a special camera. Molecular breast imaging has been used successfully in some screening studies (that is, in well women without known symptoms or breast lumps) to detect unsuspected small tumors, which in some cases had been missed by mammography.  Unfortunately this technology also requires a small radiation dose, and that may present hazards, too. Doctors working with molecular breast imaging also have reported that the technique occasionally may miss a tumor that would have been picked up on routine mammography.   At present, then, it seems that this screening method may be most useful as an adjunct to established techniques, rather than as a replacement for them. Since there is a small amount of radiation associated with molecular breast imaging, as there is also in mammography, patients also will have to be followed carefully to ensure that there are no after-effects.  The Times also reports today that the duration of radiation treatment in early-stage breast cancer can perhaps be shortened for many patients. Recent studies from Canada and Japan have suggested that instead of the usual five to seven weeks of treatment, patients may survive just as long if they are treated with larger individual doses of radiotherapy each day for just a few weeks. This finding applies only to patients with small tumors that have not spread to the lymph nodes.  Shorter duration of radiotherapy seems like a good idea, as it would reduce the time away from work or from family duties. What's the downside?   Larger individual doses of radiation can sometimes cause more side effects, such as inflammation of breast tissue, hardening of the skin over the breast and local discomfort during the radiation. Unfortunately, some of these complications may occur well after treatment is complete. It may be premature to call this strategy a complete success, although it is worth noting that patients were followed for 12 years in the recently published Canadian study.  Cancer cells may protect and repair themselves after radiation, and some are actually more efficient at this repair process after shorter courses of radiotherapy. While these recent studies suggest that equivalent results can be obtained by either short- or long- course radiation, more studies will be required, focusing on cure rates and late effects.   So what should patients make of all this? Molecular breast imaging is a work in progress, and the centers investigating it will have to continue to monitor women to see whether tumors are missed, and whether those small doses of radiation are in some way harmful.   With regard to short-course radiotherapy, I think that a reasonable approach is to consider the context. Women who have important reasons for trying to spend less time on radiotherapy (the single parent who is the sole financial support for her family, or the woman who must travel long distances to a treatment facility) might reasonably choose this option, recognizing that there MAY be more risk, but that the level of risk is reasonable, based on these recent studies.  On the other hand, for women for whom time saved merely relates to convenience, it would probably be smart to stick with tried-and-true techniques until more data are available. The benefit of the established treatment programs is that they are very well anchored, with lots of information about safety, side effects and cure rates.

BUILDING THE GREAT SOCIETY By Joshua Zeitz. (Viking, $30.) The inner workings of the White House, with its war room intensity, never ceases to capture readers’ attention. Zeitz delves here into Lyndon B. Johnson’s administration, capturing both the atmosphere and the advisers (Bill Moyers and Jack Valenti, among others) who made Johnson’s vision a reality. A LITERARY TOUR DE FRANCE By Robert Darnton. (Oxford, $34.95.) Darnton continues his decades-long exploration of how the publishing industry worked in France on the eve of the revolution.

Her alphabetically titled mysteries about the private eye Kinsey Millhone spent something like 400 weeks on the lists over all, and 10 of those books (beginning with “L Is for Lawless,” in 1995) entered at No. 1. So it comes as a surprise to learn that Grafton didn’t have a best seller until the series was eight years old and six books along, when “F Is for Fugitive” finally cracked the paperback list in 1990. “When I started writing the series, who even knew this was going to work?” Grafton told the critic and editor Sarah Weinman in a 2009 interview for The Los Angeles Times.
