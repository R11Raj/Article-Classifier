0,health,Discrimination link to health inequalities,"Your editorial (Inequalities are a matter of life and death – but exist as they do by political choice, 25 February) and various letter writers (27 February) have rightly focused on evidence from Sir Michael Marmot’s review that life expectancy has stalled or declined for the poorest. But Marmot also shows that this has been accompanied by the persistence of discrimination, concluding that “on the whole” outcomes are worse for minority ethnic groups and people with disabilities. Looking at employment, often seen by policymakers as a key to addressing health inequalities, the report shows that minority ethnic women continue to have the lowest employment rates. At the same time, ethnic minorities as a whole are more likely to experience poor-quality work. If action is taken as a result of the Marmot report, we need to ensure we deal with discrimination too.Jabeer ButtRace Equality Foundation; member of Marmot advisory group  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

1,health,Guardian US and Kaiser Health News partner to honor American health workers lost on the frontline,"Guardian US and KFF’s Kaiser Health News (KHN) today launched Lost on the Frontline, a special project aiming to document the life of every healthcare worker in America who dies from Covid-19 during the pandemic. This includes medical professionals like doctors, nurses and paramedics, and others working at hospitals, nursing homes and other medical facilities, including health aides, administrative employees and cleaning and maintenance staff. Lost on the Frontline, a digital memorial, will initially launch on both the Guardian and KHN websites, but the series will grow into a single interactive site to memorialize the workers. The resulting nationwide resource—the first of its kind— will allow journalists at the Guardian and KHN to identify patterns in how the pandemic impacts healthcare workers, shedding light on the workings and failings of the US healthcare system. Dozens of healthcare workers have already died in the pandemic and thousands have been infected, and the numbers are expected to climb significantly. The series launched with a profile of Frank Gabrin, America’s first ER doctor to die on the frontline of the coronavirus battle, as well as profiles of a jail nurse in New Jersey, a surgeon in New York City, a Veteran Affairs nurse in Detroit, and nurses at hospitals in California and Nevada. Information about healthcare workers will be crowdsourced from family, friends and colleagues of healthcare workers, as well as reported through traditional means. The series will feature profiles, photos and other information about those who have lost their lives since the outbreak began. The Guardian and KHN are inviting news organizations across the country to partner in the effort. The project will link to local news stories on healthcare worker deaths, and most content from the series will be freely available to other news organizations to republish. The project will reflect the rich diversity of the U.S. healthcare workforce. The lead partners will translate selected stories into multiple languages and make them available for publication by ethnic media outlets to ensure they reach the many communities in America being impacted by the pandemic. John Mulholland, editor of Guardian US said: “From doctors to hospital cleaners and from nursing home aides to paramedics, this project will capture the diverse range of frontline health workers risking their lives to help others in this fight. A shortage of tests and protective gear is increasing the dangers they face—and some will die trying to save others. We want to celebrate those lives and their heroism, as well as scrutinise the conditions leading to so many tragic outcomes.” Elisabeth Rosenthal, Editor-in-Chief of KHN, said: “With the help of their families and friends, we want to tell the stories of health care workers who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the COVID-19 pandemic: dying from the virus, too often after providing care without adequate equipment or protection. And in doing so, we hope to hold to account an American health care system that failed them.”The Guardian and KHN are calling for family members, friends and colleagues of health workers to share information, photos and stories about their loved ones and co-workers who died on the frontlines via this form. If you have a colleague or loved one we should include, you can also email frontline@theguardian.com or covid19tips@kff.org. ------------ ends------------- Notes to editors: Because of the scope of the project, and the many categories of workers included, this database may never be completely comprehensive.

2,health,Silent privatisation of the health service,"Your report (Beauticians’ mole removals letting skin cancers grow and causing burns, 12 February) highlights dangers to patients from interventions performed outside the NHS. In 2019, NHS England (NHSE) published guidance for commissioners on restricting a number of NHS procedures. “Removal of benign skin lesions” was in fact the major target for predicted reduced activity/anticipated savings. While the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence was involved in the NHSE consultation, it has not endorsed the recommendations to reduce activity through withdrawal of funding. In the light of your report, it’s ironic that one of NHSE’s stated objectives was to “reduce avoidable harm to patients”. It appears that the law of unintended consequences was not given due consideration. Increased risk to patients is an example of what happens when healthcare is treated as a market commodity.Dr John PuntisCo-chair, Keep Our NHS Public • A recent appointment with a healthcare professional at my GP confirmed that wax build-up explained my recent hearing loss. I was initially told that the practice had no syringing appointments currently available, but later they called and said they had decided to no longer offer this service, and that the cheapest option they recommended is £60 at Boots. I’m angered that access to health is increasingly linked to ability to pay.

3,health,"'Magic toilet' could monitor users' health, say researchers","A smart toilet boasting pressure sensors, artificial intelligence and a camera has been unveiled by researchers who say it could provide a valuable way to keep tabs on our health. The model is the latest version of an idea that has been around for several years: a system that examines our daily movements in an effort to spot the emergence of diseases. Such an approach, experts say, has an advantage over wearable devices, since individuals do not need to remember to use the system. “We have developed a passive human health monitoring system that can be easily incorporated into a normal daily routine, requiring minimal or even no human intervention,” the team behind the new toilet report. They hope it will eventually become a “daily clinic”, helping in the prevention and early detection of problems from diabetes to urinary tract infections and inflammatory bowel diseases. Writing in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering, the international team of researchers note that previous attempts at such a toilet have been expensive and have provided limited information. However, their new system can be fitted on to existing toilets and incorporates a suite of sensors and detectors.    The future will be either a magic toilet paper or these magic toilets  Tim Spector, King's College London     These include test strips that detect telltale health markers within urine, such as glucose and red blood cells, as well as video recordings of the flow to spot changes that may be related to disease.  “We believe that inconsistencies … can provide valuable information about the prostate and bladder functions,” the authors write. In addition, the system incorporates cameras that take images of users’ stool. These images are then classified using a machine-learning system – a type of artificial intelligence – into the different categories on the Bristol stool scale that reflect problems such as constipation or diarrhoea.  The toilet has further features. “It was also able to collect additional information, such as first stool dropping time and total seating time, which can potentially be acted on by clinicians to help to manage constipation and haemorrhoids,” the authors write. Perhaps most inventively, the team report that the system detects who is using the toilet from a fingerprint scanner on the flush handle, and “analprints” – distinctive creases in the lining of the anus, captured by video frames. However the team say there is more to do, not least in testing the device in large clinical studies – so far a total of 21 participants have tested the toilet. They also stress the need to develop self-cleaning mechanisms to avoid false positives in the tests, adapt the system to squatting toilets, and redesign the urine analysis system for women, as it is currently designed for users who stand up while having a pee. They also hope to expand the range of tests to screen for illicit drug use, sexually transmitted infections and the makeup of microbes in the gut.     The research team say they need to adapt the urine analysis device, as it is currently set for standing up. Photograph: Seung-min Park/Stanford University's School of Medicine/PA    But whether the system will prove popular is another matter. In a survey of 300 individuals near Stanford University who were asked to rate what they thought of the proposed toilet, 30% said they felt uncomfortable with it, primarily citing privacy concerns, with the analprint the most disliked component. Prof Tim Spector, an expert on the gut microbiome from King’s College London, who was not involved in the research, welcomed the work, but said the team’s future plans to analyse chemicals and microbes were important. “We know that your stool sample is probably the best snapshot of your current health that we have,” he said. Spector said the new toilet was a sign of things to come, predicting that regular monitoring would become commonplace. “The future will be either a magic toilet paper that gives you this result or these magic toilets that will give you a chemical analysis basically of the chemicals your microbes are producing, to give a snapshot of your inner health,” he said."
4,health,Health expert brands UK's coronavirus response 'pathetic',"A leading public health expert has launched a devastating critique of the government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak in the UK, saying it is too little too late, lacks transparency and fails to mobilise the public. 
Prof John Ashton, a former regional director of public health for north-west England, lambasted a lack of preparation and openness from the government and contrasted Britain’s response to that of Hong Kong. 
“Right at the beginning of February, they [Hong Kong] adopted a total approach to this, which is what we should have done five weeks ago ourselves. They took a decision to work to three principles – of responding promptly, staying alert, working in an open and transparent manner,” he told the Guardian. 
“Our lot haven’t been working openly and transparently. They’ve been doing it in a (non) smoke-filled room and just dribbling out stuff. The chief medical officer only appeared in public after about two weeks. Then they have had a succession of people bobbing up and disappearing. Public Health England’s been almost invisible. 
“Boris Johnson should have convened Cobra himself over a month ago and had regular meetings with the chief medical officer with the evidence. The thing should have been fronted up nationally by one person who could be regarded as the trusted voice and who could have been interrogated regularly. That’s not happened.” 
 
  
  
   
    
    The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.
    The UN agency&nbsp;advises&nbsp;people to:
    
     Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap
     Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing
     Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough
     Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers
     Advice about face masks varies. Wearing them while out and about may offer some protection against both spreading and catching the virus via coughs and sneezes, but it is not a cast-iron guarantee of protection
    
    Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.&nbsp;
    In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;stay at home for at least 7 days.
    If you live with other people,&nbsp;they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.
    
   
  
  
 
Ashton was speaking before a Cobra meeting on Thursday afternoon, which was expected to pave the way for new social distancing measures. An increasing number of European countries, including Ireland, have taken steps to close schools, limit gatherings and place restrictions on transportation. 
He accused the government of failing to understand public health, which has been undermined over the past 10 years by cuts in funding of 30% to local authorities, which were given responsibility for it under policy changes made by Andrew Lansley, the former health secretary. 
There were no strategies for protecting the vulnerable and there had been a failure to engage the public. “We have a superficial prime minister who has got no grasp of public health,” Ashton said. “Our lot are behaving like 19th-century colonialists playing a five-day game of cricket. 
“This virus will find the weak points. You can’t just plan this from an office in Whitehall. It’s pathetic. The government doesn’t seem to understand classic public health. You need to be out and about. You need to get your hands dirty – though preferably gloved and using frequent gel,” he said.

He warned that the NHS was not in a position to cope with the large numbers of people who could become seriously ill. “It’s a joke when they put up people to say they are really on top of it and if it spreads at a community level the NHS will cope, it’s always coped. The hospitals are full at the moment, A&amp;Es are full, beds are full, intensive care is full.” 
Current contingency plans assume that up to 80% of people could get infected and 4% of those are likely to have serious illness. “That translates into big numbers and there will not be enough intensive facilities for them and people will have to be home-nursed,” Ashton said. 
“What the government should have been doing over these last weeks, which they’ve thrown away, is to encourage neighbourhoods, communities, supported by the local public health directors and a joined-up NHS. 
“They should have been encouraging people to have their own family plans about how they will maintain the family show on the road, who will be taking the kids to school, how do you entertain them in the Easter holidays? They should have been much clearer, sooner, about making it clear that people shouldn’t be travelling so they could cancel their holidays and get their money back on the insurance. 
“They haven’t done any of that. Who’s going to look after elderly people – stop them having to go out, do their shopping for them? People should have been doing that planning – they should have been pointed in that direction by the government. There’s been no discussion about that at all.” 
Ashton, a Liverpool fan, said if football matches were held in empty stadiums, there was a risk that fans would congregate in pubs instead. “Clubs that have their own TV channels need to make viewing of the games free to everybody, so people can watch them at home,” he said.

5,health,Health minister Nadine Dorries diagnosed with coronavirus,"The health minister Nadine Dorries has become the first MP to be diagnosed with coronavirus, prompting concerns about the potential spread of the illness at Westminster and even at Downing Street, where she attended a reception last week. The Department of Health and Social Care DHSC confirmed that Dorries, the Conservative MP for Mid Bedfordshire since 2005 and a bestselling author of fiction, had tested positive for the infection. The identity of the individual who infected her is unknown. Focus will now fall on tracking down and testing the potentially hundreds of people Dorries will have been in contact with in the past week, both in parliament and at the health department.   Nadine Dorries has become the first MP to be diagnosed with coronavirus   She also attended a Downing Street reception last week for International Women’s Day where the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, were among guests present.   Related: ‘I’m wearing a face mask’: how doctors deal with the coronavirus risk in their daily lives    A DHSC spokeswoman said Dorries, who began her career as a nurse, has been self-isolating at home since Friday. She is understood to be recovering. In a statement released by the department, she said: “I can confirm I have tested positive for coronavirus. As soon as I was informed I took all the advised precautions and have been self-isolating at home.     Boris Johnson with Nadine Dorries during a Tory leadership hustings in Bedfordshire. Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA    “Public Health England has started detailed contact tracing and the department and my parliamentary office are closely following their advice. I would like to thank PHE and the wonderful NHS staff who have provided me with advice and support.” After the news was announced she tweeted:    Thanks for so many good wishes. It’s been pretty rubbish but I hope I’m over the worst of it now. More worried about my 84yo mum who is staying with me and began with the cough today. She is being tested tomorrow. Keep safe and keep washing those hands, everyone.&mdash; Nadine Dorries 🇬🇧 (@NadineDorries) March 10, 2020    Matt Hancock, the health secretary, tweeted: “Really sorry to hear Nadine has tested positive for coronavirus. She has done the right thing by self isolating at home, and both NHS and PHE staff have been brilliant. We all wish her well as she recovers.” There has been speculation that parliament could be suspended to limit the spread of coronavirus among MPs, peers and staff, but Downing Street has as yet played down this idea. A spokesman said there were still no plans to suspend parliament to prevent the spread of the virus. “We are closely following guidance from Public Health England (PHE) in response to the situation and have been reassured that the measures we are taking are proportionate and appropriate,” he said. “At present there are no plans to suspend parliament. Changes to the way parliament functions would be a matter for consultation between the Speakers, the government and the parliamentary authorities.”       A government source told PA Media that officials and MPs should continue to go to work in Whitehall and parliament unless told otherwise, saying chief medical officer advice was that “no one needs to self-isolate or be tested unless asked to by the PHE contact tracers who are working round the clock”. There was no immediate response to Dorries’ diagnosis from No 10."
6,health,Health insurance myths that might surprise you,"More than 13 million Australians have some form of private health insurance. But many of us choose a policy without really understanding what we’re paying for. We talked to four experts to find out how we could all be getting more from our cover. The panel:   panel headshots   Guardian: What are the most common myths Australians believe about private health insurance? Thinking the public system will look after them Terry Barnes: The most common misconception is that people can rely on the public system to look after them - when they need it, where they need it and for what they need - and that’s not always the case. The private hospital sector is a great place to get things done. Taking out private health insurance actually relieves pressure on the public system. We are actually contributing to the health of other Australians by using that private choice. Assuming younger people aren’t taking out health insurance Matthew Koce: Younger people are in much greater numbers than the rest of the industry. More than 31,000 people aged under 40 have joined a Members Health fund since 2017. Our funds are attracting younger members; other funds are losing them. People also might not realise there are funds that are restricted to a particular industry or profession, and that many people would qualify for them. If you’re with one of these funds, or another Members Health fund, you’ve got access to a national hospital network, just like any other insurer. No matter how old or young you are, life can deliver some unpleasant surprises. For example, an injury on the sporting field may require elective surgery, and not having private health insurance could mean a very long and painful wait for treatment in a public hospital. Not realising that pre-existing condition rules don’t refer to whether the consumer already knew about the condition Ombudsman: Consumers may not realise that the pre-existing condition (PEC) rule relies on the signs and symptoms being present prior to joining an insurer, and not whether the consumer already knew about the condition or if the condition has already been diagnosed. Conditions deemed to be PEC are not covered in the first 12 months after joining or upgrading. Thinking that if you’re really sick you will end up going to a public hospital Michael Roff: There’s a common myth that if you’re really sick, you’ll end up going to a public hospital. That is not necessarily the case. About a third of all hospital beds in Australia are private, and private hospitals undertake about 40% of all episodes of care, and 60% of all surgery. The research we’ve done shows people take out private hospital cover for peace of mind, and choice and access, but there’s not a good understanding of what people are and aren’t covered for. Understanding what is and is not in your product is very important, and you should continually monitor that as you go through different stages of life. Guardian: How do consumers get it wrong when trying to get the most out of their health funds? Not asking the right questions before choosing their fund Ombudsman: Issues can arise when consumers find that they are not covered for a service or treatment that they had assumed was included in their cover, leaving them unable to access treatment or incurring large expenses to access the hospital treatment they need. Customers can avoid this challenge and choose the right health fund for them by asking the right questions. - If I go to hospital, will I have to pay an excess or make any co-payments? - Are there any treatments I won’t get full hospital benefits for? Am I willing to take the risk of not being fully covered for those treatments? - Does the insurer have agreements with the private hospitals I might need to attend in my area? - How does the insurer’s gap cover scheme work? - Will this policy exempt me from the Medicare levy surcharge? How much will this policy cost? Buying on price point, not on need, and overreliance on comparison sites Michael Roff: People are buying on a price point rather than what they might need. We did some research recently that showed more than 40% of people didn’t know whether their product had an exclusion. Consumers also need to be wary of commercial comparison websites. The government has a comprehensive site that covers every product. Make sure you pick a level of cover that has all the services you need, and then compare different funds on price and service models. Matthew Koce: Comparison websites often receive commissions, which may influence who and what they recommend. They also do not always show every health fund in the market, nor every product available. That’s why it is best to shop around by going directly to health fund websites and picking up the phone for a chat. Getting the right cover to fit with your lifestyle and health needs is really important. For families with kids, dental cover may be a key consideration. If you’re into sports, physio, chiro and remedial massage may be a priority. Having chat with the experts at a Members Health fund can prove to be a very wise investment of your time. Looking at price and not at restrictions, exclusions and excesses Matthew Koce: Consumers should carefully consider restrictions, exclusions, excesses and co-payments when making their selection. Just going off the overall premium price can lead to some nasty surprises. If you do take out a policy with restrictions and exclusions, Members Health funds are very good at making sure you will be informed about what is covered, and more importantly, what is not. One of the things members get is really good advice. Before anyone is admitted to hospital, we always encourage them to ring their health fund and have a chat. Check out each of our member funds sites - links are found on our homepage - then pick up the phone and talk to the experts. A set and forget mentality Terry Barnes: A lot of people with private health insurance set and forget. With the government’s changes to rules for tiers you can sit down relatively easily and work out what’s in your policy and what’s not. It’s up to you to keep checking and making sure your policy covers everything you and your family need. There are 35-odd health funds, so it’s understanding the differences between what they offer, the levels of cover that you are interested in, and having a real sense of what you and your family’s health needs are actually like to be over the next five, 10, 20 years. Be prepared to buy. You may not need the top level of cover now, but you may need it in future - you can always change as your needs change.

7,health,Health secretary says coronavirus peak remarks 'over interpreted',"The health secretary urgently sought to play down his suggestion that the peak number of deaths caused by coronavirus could fall as early as Easter Sunday – claiming his remarks had been “over interpreted”. 
Matt Hancock began his media appearances on Friday by saying it was “perfectly possible” the peak of the disease could arrive in nine days’ time. 
His comment led to confusion hours later at the daily Downing Street press conference as the government’s deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, asked when the epidemic was expected to peak, said: “We don’t know the answer to that yet.” 
 
  
  
   
    
    Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:
    
     a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back
     a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly
    
    NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;stay at home for at least 7 days.
    If you live with other people,&nbsp;they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.
    After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.&nbsp;Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.
    If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.
    If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.
    After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.
    If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.
    If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.
    Staying at home means you should:
    
     not go to work, school or public areas
     not use public transport or taxis
     not have visitors, such as friends and family, in your home
     not go out to buy food or collect medicine – order them by phone or online, or ask someone else to drop them off at your home
    
    You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.
    If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the&nbsp;NHS 111 coronavirus service&nbsp;to find out what to do.
    Source:&nbsp;NHS England&nbsp;on 23 March 2020
    
   
  
  
 
Van-Tam said it was “too soon to say” when the peak would hit, appearing to contradict the health secretary. 
“It will partly depend upon how well those social distancing measures are adhered to by every one of us,” he said. “I hope it will be soon. We’re going to watch very carefully to see when we’ve hit the peak and when we’re starting to turn it, but we will not take any premature actions.” 
Easter Sunday falls on 12 April this year, and Hancock had earlier said he would not steer people away from anticipating that date as the peak in the number of fatalities in the UK, though there was still uncertainty around it. 
He clarified his remarks during the Downing Street press conference on Friday evening after being asked again by Sky News when he thought the peak would fall. “The truth is that we don’t know,” he said. 
He claimed his remarks had been over interpreted and he had been clear that the government could not give a definitive answer in his earlier interviews. 
He said: “Actually, there’s a reason we don’t know, and that’s because it depends on how people act, and this is why the absolute central message, the most important message that anybody can take away from this press conference or the entirety of the government’s messaging and how we feel, is that you’ve got to stay at home.” 
 
  
  
   
    What is Covid-19?
    
    Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.
    
    What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?
    
    According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment.
    About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.
    In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:
    
     a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back
     a new continuous cough - this means you’ve started coughing repeatedly
    
    As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.
    
    Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?
    
    Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.
    In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.
    
   
  
  
 
The first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, said Hancock’s 12 April suggestion did not feel accurate considering the evidence she had assessed. She said: “I want to be very clear that nothing I have seen gives me any basis whatsoever for predicting the virus will peak as early as a week’s time here in Scotland.” 
Her chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, stressed: “I have not been able to find that the peak will be as soon as we’re hearing in the media today. Now is not the time to think that perhaps it will all be over soon.” 
Several government ministers have come under fire for giving mixed messages to the public, including the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, who incorrectly said people should only go shopping for food once a week, which was later corrected by No 10. 
Michael Gove also stepped in to explain that daily exercise should be a walk or run close to home after people had interpreted the government’s rule as allowing them to travel further afield. 
The prime minister has also been criticised for talking about plans for up to 250,000 tests a day. The health secretary confirmed the immediate aim was 100,000 tests a day by the end of April."
8,health,Iran's deputy health minister: I have coronavirus,"Iran’s deputy health minister said he has contracted the coronavirus and placed himself in isolation, a day after appearing feverish at a press conference in which he downplayed its spread in the shrine city of Qom and said mass quarantines were unnecessary. 
Iraj Harirchi posted a video on social media on Tuesday acknowledging he had caught the virus, which appears to be taking rapid hold in parts of Iran. The news has underscored widespread fears that the outbreak may have passed a tipping point, before authorities had been able to gauge its full extent. 
Images of one of the country’s most senior public health officials appearing sweaty and pale and acknowledging he had contracted the disease left many Iranians deeply troubled and are likely to further paralyse a county reeling from its rapid onset. In the short video, Hirachi acknowledged that “many may get infected” echoing concerns that have taken root in the rest of the Middle East, which is home to millions of people living in densely packed refugee camps.

“I wanted to tell you that I got corona,” said Harirchi. “I had a fever yesterday. The tests came back positive last night. I isolated myself. Just a few moments ago, I was told that the final test came. I’ll start taking medicine. Generally, I feel fine. I just felt a bit tired, I had a fever, and it will drop. 
“Be sure with the effort of the medical staff and ministry of health headed by the [health minister] and with your support and the state and military within the coming weeks, we’ll be victorious against this virus. 
“We’ll defeat corona. Be assured. I’m saying this deep from my heart. This virus is democratic, and it doesn’t distinguish between poor and rich or statesman and an ordinary citizen. 
“Many might get infected, but we have enough effective medicine, take care of yourselves. Take care of the nurses and doctors who work heroically.”

Iran has become the regional focal point of fears surrounding coronavirus. Neighbouring states have largely shut their borders and suspended pilgrimage routes. Schools and universities in many parts of the country have been closed. Four new cases were suspected to have been diagnosed in the Iraqi city of Kirkuk on Tuesday. If confirmed, it would take the national tally to five cases, a number that is widely expected to rise, possibly substantially, in the coming days. Afghanistan, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman also reported their first new coronavirus cases, all in people who had been to Iran. 
Meanwhile, Turkey diverted a plane from Tehran, which had been destined for Istanbul, to its capital Ankara, after 17 passengers were reported to have higher than average temperatures.

9,health,Health experts condemn Trump's halting of funding to WHO,"Global health leaders have rounded on Donald Trump, warning that his decision to suspend funding to the World Health Organization is recklessly endangering the chances of ending the pandemic as fast as possible. 
Experts said they were dismayed and appalled at the US president’s announcement, which will not only deprive the WHO of the resources it needs to lead the fight, but potentially undermine international collaboration between scientists. 
“Halting funding to the WHO is a dangerous, short-sighted and politically motivated decision, with potential public health consequences for all countries in the world, whether they are rich or poor,” said Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and formerly head of UNAIDS. 
“The Covid-19 pandemic is the greatest global health challenge facing our societies and economies for more than 100 years.

“We need the World Health Organization now more than ever. Its technical expertise, guidance and leadership is supporting countries to implement optimum science-based strategies to prevent and control Covid-19, and will catalyse global action against future health emergencies.” 
Trump announced late on Tuesday that US funding would be put on hold for 60 to 90 days pending a review of the WHO’s warnings about the coronavirus and China. He accused the global body of “severely mismanaging and covering up” the threat, even though it declared a public health emergency on 30 January.  
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
On 26 February, during a coronavirus task force press briefing at the White House, Trump said: “I want you to understand something that shocked me when I saw it that – and I spoke with Dr Fauci on this, and I was really amazed, and I think most people are amazed to hear it: the flu, in our country, kills from 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year. That was shocking to me. 
“And, so far, if you look at what we have with the 15 people and their recovery, one is – one is pretty sick but hopefully will recover, but the others are in great shape. But think of that: 25,000 to 69,000.”

Mark Suzman, chief executive of the Gates Foundation – the second largest funder of the WHO after the US – said he would “strongly oppose” any cuts to the funding of the WHO which was critical to the Covid-19 crisis. He also announced a further $150m donation towards the hunt for a vaccine, for which the foundation plans to build factories and therapeutics. 
The UK government’s response was lukewarm. Asked about Trump’s decision, Boris Johnson’s spokesman said: “Our position is that the UK has no plans to stop funding the WHO, which has an important role to play in leading the global health response. Coronavirus is a global challenge and it’s essential that countries work together to tackle this shared threat.” 
Asked if this meant No 10 was disappointed by the president’s move, the spokesman said: “I can only set out the UK’s position and that is we have no plans to stop funding the WHO.” 
At his daily press briefing in Geneva, the director general of the WHO expressed regret at the US move and warned that the coronavirus would exploit divisions among those trying to fight it. 
When the pandemic was over, WHO’s performance against Covid-19 would be scrutinised, said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, but now was not the time. “Covid-19 does not discriminate between rich nations and poor, large nations and small. It does not discriminate between nationalities, ethnicities or ideologies,” he said. 
“This is a time for all of us to be united in our common struggle against a common threat. When we are divided, the coronavirus exploits the cracks between.” 
The US had been a long-standing and generous friend to WHO and they hoped it would continue to be so, said Tedros. “We regret the decision of the president of the United States to order a halt in funding to WHO.” 
He and his colleagues mounted a robust defence of their actions. WHO had not hesitated to warn of the possibility of human-to-human transmission, they said. As early as 11 January, it issued guidance on the dangers of droplets spreading from one person to another, which could transmit the infection to frontline health workers, as happened in Sars, said Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, an American infectious diseases epidemiologist working at WHO. 
Experts fear that the work of the WHO in fighting disease and improving health and healthcare systems around the world could be jeopardised. At issue is not just the response to the current pandemic, and major programmes such as polio eradication which receives substantial funds from the US, but the collaboration between scientists and doctors at institutions around the world, who will hesitate to pool their knowledge and expertise if they think there may be political consequences. 
“The WHO is a place where anxieties and concerns can be discussed without the sense that you are going to be somehow called out,” said David Nabarro, professor of global health at Imperial College London who worked at the highest levels of WHO for many years. 
“The challenge for the director general of WHO is always to maintain the core values of public health even when this goes against some of the political priorities of elected leaders. It is not unusual for there to be some form of conflict. The challenge is to try to create an environment where the opportunity for people to share is maintained and they are not having to look over their shoulder in fear that they are going to fall foul of the political priorities of leaders.” 
David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, also emphasised WHO’s role as a forum for the world’s scientists and health experts. 
“The strength of WHO is that it is able to bring together public health experts from around the world to exchange information, review scientific evidence, and make evidence based consensus recommendations on disease prevention and control,” he said.

Public health and infectious diseases experts said the WHO needed more funds, not less, to lead the fight against the pandemic and help low and middle-income countries, where it plays a crucial role. 
“We are facing the greatest challenge of our lifetime and the WHO is doing an extraordinary job ensuring every country can tackle this virus, protect citizens and save lives,” said Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of research charity the Wellcome Trust. “No other organisation can do what they do and we owe them all our respect, thanks and gratitude. This is a time for solidarity not division.”"
10,health,Pregnant nurse's death adds to concern among health workers,"Pregnant healthcare workers across the UK have spoken of their fear at being pushed into working at the frontline of the coronavirus crisis, as it emerged that a nurse who was close to full-term has died of Covid-19. Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong had an emergency caesarean to deliver and save her baby daughter, who survived and is being cared for. The 28-year-old tested positive for the virus on 5 April. She had the caesarean soon after going into hospital on 7 April but died on Sunday. The hospital said she had finished her last shift on 12 March, and had not been at work since then, adding that they had followed official guidance and she was not treating coronavirus patients.   Related: Pregnancy and the Covid-19 frontline | Letters    It is not known if she was infected when she was still working or if the baby has contracted Covid-19. It is understood her husband is self-isolating. Her colleagues at Luton and Dunstable University hospital said she was “a fabulous nurse, and a great example of what we stand for”. The NHS trust’s chief executive, David Carter, said the survival of her baby daughter was a “beacon of light at this very dark time”.  Organisations supporting pregnant women have told the Guardian that hundreds of healthcare workers are being told they must work – sometimes without personal protective equipment – even though they fear for their unborn children. The Guardian has heard from healthcare assistants, care home workers, nurses, physiotherapists and NHS childcare workers who in many cases have capitulated to the pressure to work, or have taken unpaid leave or sick pay. Pregnant nurses and healthcare assistants said they were working in direct contact with patients who had tested positive for Covid-19 or were suspected of having contracted it, despite government guidelines classifying them as a vulnerable group. “We are disgusted with the treatment and stress they are putting us in at this already stressful time,” said one healthcare assistant. Lobby groups and charities, including Pregnant Then Screwed(PTS) and Maternity Action, have written to the the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) urging it to change its guidance, which states women who are less than 28 weeks pregnant can continue in non-Covid patient-facing roles if necessary precautions are taken. More than 50,000 people have signed a petition calling for more clarity and paid leave for pregnant healthcare workers. Some pregnant women are being “gaslighted” by bosses and sometimes colleagues to go to work on the frontline, with a number of health trusts interpreting the RCOG guidelines differently, said Joeli Brearley, the founder and director of PTS. “These women are really scared,” said Brearley. “Because this is being phrased as a woman’s choice, it is causing serious anxiety to women who don’t want to go to work but are being made to feel like they don’t want to help out during this crisis.” One emergency-trained theatre nurse, who is 18 weeks pregnant and has miscarried five times, said she was redeployed in a “clean” intensive care unit for non-Covid-19 patients but has since dealt with seriously ill ventilated patients waiting for Covid-19 test results. When she asked to be redeployed she was told she would have to go on sick leave despite having a letter from her GP. “I am not the only pregnant nurse working in my area, none of us has been treated with respect since the Covid outbreak,” said the 26-year-old. “I am disappointed with the NHS. Staff are not being protected at all.” In a recent survey of 3,004 pregnant women carried out by PTS, 34% of 261 pregnant NHS workers who took part said they were still working and worried about their safety. Legally all employers must carry out a risk assessment for pregnant workers, and if they cannot remove the risk of infection find an alternative role or suspend on full pay. It is unlawful for employers to force workers to take sick pay, holiday or unpaid leave. In recent days, 111 workers who had been at home on full pay were now being told their workplace was safe, said Brearley. One 37-year-old, who is pregnant after her “last chance” of IVF, said she was told to return to work on the day she received the call. “Now I’m venturing into the peak of the pandemic in the worst situation I could think of,” she said. Her GP told her all NHS workers were scared and worried but were “getting on with it” before asking her not to contact the practice again. “I’ve been left feeling incredibly guilty,” she said. Rosalind Bragg, director of Maternity Action, said its helpline was fielding calls from healthcare workers, particularly care workers, being unlawfully forced to take sick leave. She said a lack of clear government guidance and absence of consequences for employers acting unlawfully were exacerbating the issue.  A spokesperson for the RCOG said its guidance was supported by the UK chief medical officers and that existing employment law “should help ensure … pregnant women in the first two trimesters of pregnancy avoid, where possible, caring for patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection”.   Related: Pregnant healthcare staff under pressure to work during Covid-19 crisis    RCOG guidance is being updated to make clear that pregnant women should not have to continue working without a risk assessment, and that suitable alternative work should be offered, said the spokesperson."
11,health,Health and care systems must be integrated,"Polly Toynbee is right to underline concerns over how the government’s immigration proposals are likely to significantly worsen existing serious staffing problems within social care (Social care is crumbling, and Johnson has no idea how to fix it, Journal, 21 February). I was, however, surprised that she did not argue the point that, while additional care funding might alleviate some of the current difficulties, any long-term solution to what is not unreasonably termed the current “crisis” has to involve addressing its relationship with the NHS. She makes the point that NHS staff doing similar work to those in social care get paid more. But, as the needs they are dealing with and the skills they require are similar, in addressing the very real problems in social care, shouldn’t we be asking the fairly obvious question as to why on earth we have separate health and care systems in the first place? Having spent my entire working life in social services and the NHS – meeting many of the great and good of both sectors along the way – I have yet to meet anyone who can offer a clear definition of the dividing line between the two when, for example, addressing the complexities of something like dementia. But the lack of a unified approach to health and care leads to a scandalous waste of scarce public resources, especially as a consequence of the longstanding issue of delayed transfers of care from free NHS hospitals into means-tested provision within the community. Formally integrating the two systems would lead to a far more humane approach to dealing with the needs of individuals and, logically, to the gradual alignment of staff terms and conditions, which would be of particular benefit of care staff. A long-term political goal should undoubtedly be universal free social care, as well as free NHS provision. Of course it will cost money but if, alongside ending the gross inefficiencies of two separate structures, the privatised care system is gradually returned to public ownership, I suspect there may be far more public resources released than most people realise.David HinchliffeChair, House of Commons health committee, 1987-2005 • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

12,health,Africa's fragile health systems rush to contain coronavirus,"Governments across Africa are rushing to reinforce measures to contain the spread of coronavirus, fearing that fragile health systems will be swiftly overwhelmed if the disease spreads beyond a small number of cases on the continent. 
World Health Organization (WHO) officials have called for a strong response to a “tremendously fast rise in the number of countries with cases being confirmed”. 
“We have to ratchet up what is being done,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO’s regional director for Africa. 
“It is what is done at this point that will determine the numbers who will become very ill … I still think it is possible that we will prevent large numbers of people dying but it needs coordination, a huge effort and huge resources.” 
Most infections involve people who have recently been in Europe or other disease hot spots, but the number of cases of internal transmission are rising every day. 
Tedros Ghebreyesus, the director general of the WHO, has warned that official numbers may underestimate the extent of the spread of the disease. 
“Probably we have undetected cases or unreported cases,” he said. “In other countries we have seen how the virus actually accelerates after a certain tipping point, so the best advice for Africa is to prepare for the worst and prepare today.” 
Health officials across Africa know that hospitals can deal with only a fraction of those needing care if the virus spreads through overcrowded cities, remote villages and among vulnerable populations such as refugees, the malnourished or those suffering from HIV and other chronic conditions.

The WHO is working to establish the exact numbers of ICU beds available across the continent. “We know [the number] is extremely limited … It is a huge challenge,” said Moetse. “It is necessary not to give up on containment .” 
South Africa, which has one of Africa’s best public health systems, has fewer than 1,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, of which 160 are in the private sector, for a population of 56m. In Malawi, there are about 25 ICU beds in public hospitals, serving 17 million people. The main infectious diseases hospital in Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare, has none, Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights said. 
Nigeria, Africa’s most populous state, is scrambling to add isolation beds and provide more specialised medical training and equipment at state hospitals. 
“Our health system is not as strong as we’d like it to be,” said Chikwe Ihekweazu, the head of Nigeria’s Centre for Disease Control. “It is because we are a bit worried about our capacity to deal with a large outbreak that we are focused so intensively on prevention and early detection.” 
Many states have suspended flights and other transport links with badly hit zones in Europe and Asia, or are strictly controlling entry. Restrictions have also been placed on public gatherings, schools and religious services, and mass events have been cancelled across the continent. 
Jane Ruth Aceng, Uganda’s minister of health, said the country was on “high alert” as almost all its neighbours have registered cases of Covid-19. “No country can say they are 100% prepared,” Aceng told the Guardian. 
Uganda’s new coronavirus tsar, Atel Kagirita, said the virus “will not be a big problem ... if we can effectively stop local transmission.” 
“We … don’t envisage having many cases [needing critical care] because we are putting all our efforts on prevention. We are doing a lot of community awareness campaigns and public education,” Kagirita said. 
Though Aceng said she was confident Uganda has “enough capacity beds, some ICU units and ventilation to handle a possible outbreak”, some fear this is too optimistic. Uganda – population 44m – is relying primarily on the 1,500-bed Mulago National Referral Hospital. Its ICU can currently accommodate 60 patients. 
There are also limited facilities for isolation. In South Sudan, devastated by a five-year civil war, the government has just 24 isolation beds, said Dr. Angok Gordon Kuol, incident manager for the outbreak at the ministry of health. 
In Somalia, health minister Dr Fawziya Abikar said the government has established a quarantine facility at Mogadishu airport and was equipping a hospital to deal with Covid-19 cases. “We are still waiting for more equipment for the hospital to arrive,” he said. 
Dr Ali Yusuf, one of a team of health officials preventing and controlling the Coronavirus, told the Guardian that facilities were extremely limited. “We only have 15 tents, with one bed each for quarantine and isolation of suspected cases. Our hospital can accommodate only 100 beds,” Dr Yusuf said. 
Many African countries have extensive experience in controlling highly infectious and potentially lethal diseases. Preparations for an outbreak of Ebola, which killed more than 11,000 people in west Africa between 2013 and 2016, mean that Uganda has already stockpiled protective equipment, drugs and tents, as well as developing a capacity of moving samples around the country to a central laboratory or using mobile testing laboratories. 
Also, the delayed arrival of the virus has allowed governments to work with the WHO to strengthen emergency coordination, improve surveillance, and begin equipping treatment centres. 
But few doubt that if the virus starts to take hold the consequences could be very serious, with health systems rapidly overwhelmed.

Prof Pauline Byakika, a specialist in infectious diseases at Uganda’s Makerere University College of Health Sciences, said she was worried that “once its gets here, [coronavirus] was going to spread very fast”. She said the “social environment” of many homes, with poor hygiene and ventilation, posed a very high risk. 
“They are about five or six people in a house with one or two windows. Before you know it the whole household is going to be sick,” she said. 
There are similar fears in South Africa, where president Cyril Ramaphosa has declared a state of national disaster and imposed stringent restrictions. As elsewhere in the continent, the youthfulness of South Africa’s population may help – only 6% of South Africans are older than 65, which is the higher-risk age group for coronavirus. However, tens of millions live in vast townships and share crowded public transport. Of the 7.7 million South Africans living with HIV, about half are not taking medication that would restore their compromised immune systems. 
 
  
  
   
    
    The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.
    The UN agency&nbsp;advises&nbsp;people to:
    
     Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap
     Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing
     Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough
     Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers
     Advice about face masks varies. Wearing them while out and about may offer some protection against both spreading and catching the virus via coughs and sneezes, but it is not a cast-iron guarantee of protection
    
    Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.&nbsp;
    In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;stay at home for at least 7 days.
    If you live with other people,&nbsp;they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.
    
   
  
  
 
“We are at this very early phase where it is critically important that we contain the virus,” said Richard Friedland, the head of South Africa’s largest private healthcare provider Netcare. “The key issue is with people living in informal settlements, in shacks … that (are) very difficult to self isolate.”  
Many countries in Africa already face huge challenges from war or natural disasters or both. “The worst is yet to come on the continent … I fear it will be impossible to stop the spread of the virus in a refugee camp,” said Patrick Youssef, the deputy director for Africa at the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
A 2016 analysis by the Rand Corporation, the US think-tank, found that of the 25 countries in the world that were most vulnerable to infectious outbreaks, 22 were in Africa. The others were Afghanistan, Yemen and Haiti. 
“Were a communicable disease to emerge within this chain of countries, it could easily spread across borders in all directions, abetted by high overall vulnerability and a string of weak national health systems along the way,” the report warned.

13,health,'Urgent studies needed' into mental health impact of coronavirus,"Rapid and rigorous research into the impact of Covid-19 on mental health is needed to limit the impact of the pandemic, researchers have said. Experts say newly conducted polls and emerging studies into Covid-19 together with lessons from past outbreaks suggest that the pandemic could have profound and potentially long-term impacts on mental health. The team say it is now crucial to begin a thorough and coordinated programme of research to delve into the impact of the coronavirus itself, as well as policies like lockdown.. Prof Ed Bullmore, head of the department of psychiatry at the University of Cambridge and a co-author of the new report, said research conducted so far has been small-scale and fragmented. “Our key message is that Covid is likely to have major impacts on mental health now and into the future and we need to start thinking about that immediately,” he said. Writing in the journal Lancet Psychiatry, Bullmore and a team of colleagues in mental health sciences brought together by the charity MQ and the UK Academy of Medical Sciences, say that among key priorities is the need for real-time monitoring of mental health issues, both across the general population and at-risk groups, as well as healthcare professionals. “The pandemic is clearly having a major social and psychological impact on the whole population, increasing unemployment, separating families and various other changes in the way that we live that we know are generally major psychological risk factors for anxiety, depression and self-harm,” said Bullmore. The team say there is also a need to look at the impact of policies to manage the pandemic on unemployment and poverty, which play a role in mental health problems. They add that among other priorities, it is important to explore ways people have found to cope with the pandemic, and urgently find ways to support mental wellbeing, particularly in vulnerable groups as well as healthcare workers.. They also flag a need to understand the impact of repeatedly looking at news and other media around Covid-19 And the researchers say more investigations are needed into the possible impact of the coronavirus on the brain, noting recent research from China which found that of 214 patients in hospitals in Wuhan with Covid-19, 78 reported neurological symptoms. “We think it is also possible that there will be an impact on mental health more specifically in Covid patients in ways that are linked to the brain and the body’s response to viral infection,” said Bullmore. The team stress that the research programme could not only provide insights into how to tackle outbreaks and ramifications of Covid-19 in the future, but could help in the short-term – for example in finding the best way to communicate public health measures and change behaviours without triggering distress, and repurposing digital therapies that can be rapidly scaled up and delivered to those in need. Prof Rory O’Connor, from the University of Glasgow, a co-author of the study, said that while it is too early to say for certain what the mental health impact of Covid-19 will be, there are lessons to learn from the past. “If we look at the Sars outbreak in 2003, we know there is evidence there that there were increased rates of anxiety, increased rates of depression and post-traumatic stress and, in some groups, there were also increased rates of suicide,” he said. The team also reveal results from two online surveys, covering more than 3,000 people in total, conducted in the UK in the week the lockdown began. One focused largely on people who had experience of mental health problems while the other involved the UK general public. The team say the surveys flagged widespread concerns among participants about the impact of the coronavirus on mental health, from access to support services to concerns around social isolation and increases in anxiety and other problems.       While Bullmore added that it was understandable that the physical health impacts of Covid-19 had received significant funding, it was also important to prepare for the mental health aspects. “When we are thinking about this as a health crisis we need to keep thinking about mental and physical health together and not apart,” he said. Prof Wendy Burn, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, welcomed the team’s call for action, adding that mental health research is significantly underfunded, lagging behind funding for illnesses such as cancer. “The long-term mental health impacts of this unprecedented pandemic – on people with existing mental illness and other vulnerable groups, on the health and social care workforce, and on the healthy population – are not yet fully known but they may be equally unprecedented,” she said. • In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

14,health,Brazil: Bolsonaro's defiance of distancing criticized by health minister,"Brazil’s health minister has publicly defied President Jair Bolsonaro over coronavirus, accusing him of sowing doubt in Brazilian minds over the need for physical distancing. In a Sunday night interview with Brazil’s most-watched television network, Luiz Henrique Mandetta signalled that Bolsonaro’s insistence on snubbing health ministry distancing recommendations was confusing the country’s 210 million citizens. “They don’t know whether to listen to the health minister or to the president,” Mandetta said. He urged Bolsonaro’s administration to present “a single, united line” on how to tackle the pandemic. In a clear dig at Bolsonaro’s repeated defiance of distancing guidelines, Mandetta said: “When you see people going into bakeries, to supermarkets … this is clearly something that is wrong.”    Presidente @jairbolsonaro pára para comer numa padaria de Brasília. pic.twitter.com/uVcRWqyZDj&mdash; Eduardo Bolsonaro🇧🇷 (@BolsonaroSP) April 9, 2020    Brazil’s far-right leader visited a supermarket in the capital, Brasília, on 29 March and a bakery last Thursday, where he hugged and took photographs with fans. “No one will hinder my right to come and go,” Bolsonaro vowed at a pharmacy on Friday. During Mandetta’s interview – which Bolsonaro reportedly took badly – he also appeared to liken his boss’s aversion to distancing to the behaviour of an uncooperative diabetic who refused to follow doctor’s orders not to eat sweets. “We can say to them: ‘This is going to cause you problems, your kidneys will fail, you might suffer vision loss, or have your leg amputated’,” the health minister said. But some would insist on eating sweets.   Related: Bolsonaro's anti-science response to coronavirus appals Brazil's governors    Others have harsher words for Bolsonaro, who experts fear is hastening Brazil’s march towards a healthcare calamity. On Saturday, Merval Pereira, a prominent political commentator, accused the president of behaving like “a mystical leader leading his followers to collective suicide”. Bolsonaro, who claims to be defending Brazil’s economy, has championed what he calls “vertical isolation” – the domestic shielding of only the elderly and at-risk groups. Within Brazil’s medical community, that suggestion has been opposed as ineffectual and misguided. “It doesn’t make much sense to me. To me it is like a swimming pool with four people in it – and only two of those people are allowed to urinate,” said Ricardo Sobhie Diaz, an infectious diseases specialist from São Paulo’s Federal University. On Sunday, as Brazil’s recorded 99 new Covid-19 deaths, taking the death toll to 1,223, Bolsonaro falsely claimed “this matter of the virus appears to be going away”. Mandetta warned “very tough days” lay ahead, with May and June likely to be critical months."
15,health,Hospital admission puts new focus on Boris Johnson's health,"The news that Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital for tests on Sunday night with persistent coronavirus symptoms has shone a spotlight on the prime minister’s health. 
While Johnson is not known to have any underlying health conditions, he has been open about his struggle with obesity – a known risk factor for coronavirus. 
According to a report published last week, more than 70% of patients placed in intensive care after being infected with Covid-19 were overweight, obese or severely obese on the body mass index scale. 
In December 2018, when Johnson was foreign secretary, he said in the Spectator that he weighed 16 and a half stone, which at 5ft 9in would have put him in the obese category. Johnson has lost weight since then, but it has fluctuated significantly throughout his political career. 
Sonia Purnell, author of Just Boris: A Tale of Blond Ambition, said that the prime minister’s usual wellbeing was striking. “By and large, he is remarkably fit considering he is actually a bit overweight,” she said. “He’s not really that active, his runs aren’t very long or very energetic and he is very fond of cheese. In fact, he likes eating a lot – nothing wrong with that – but he does have a very robust constitution. In the time I’ve known him since the 90s, illness has never really come up.” 
Johnson became a devoted runner in the early 2000s. In his book Boris: The Rise of Boris Johnson, Andrew Gimson notes the prime minister also took up cycling in London in 1999 and quickly became “the most famous cyclist in Britain”. Gimson added that cycling had several attractions for Boris: “It was energetic, dangerous, anarchic.” While he was mayor of London, Johnson was involved in several near-miss accidents while cycling, including a 2009 incident in east London. 
In 2013, Johnson went on a major health kick before taking part in the first Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100, a now annual closed-roads cycle ride out of the capital and into the countryside. At the start of his training regime, which he styled Operation Chiselled Whippet, Johnson, who was then 48, conceded that he was “pushing 17 stone, and since my normal cycling speed is so slow that my wife says it is a miracle I stay upright, I have decided to get in shape”. 
When Theresa May made him foreign secretary in 2016, Johnson lamented the impact the job had on his lifestyle. While he was back on his bike after returning to the backbench, his cycling days were limited, as he would soon be entering No 10. 
As well as jogging and cycling, Johnsonis a keen tennis player. At an auction for the Conservative party’s annual winter ball, a game of tennis with the prime minister was auctioned for £45,000. 
Purnell traces Johnson’s appetite for sport to his childhood, when he was encouraged to run, jump, and play “whiff-whaff”, better known as table tennis. At Eton, he played rugby and cricket, and took part in the Wall Game, a sport unique to the private school. 
More recently, Johnson is reported to have given up his running due to issues with his knees. The prime minister instead participates in online classes that include yoga and pilates. 
Purnell says the hospital admission will be difficult for Johnson who, like his father, rarely admits to illness or notices it in others. “When I worked with him as his deputy [in the Daily Telegraph’s Brussels bureau], he was certainly very, very intolerant of illness in others, and considered it as sort of a weakness.”

16,health,New Zealand health minister caught mountain biking during lockdown,"New Zealand’s health minister has apologised to Jacinda Ardern after he was photographed mountain biking, apparently flouting the government’s own advice to exercise safely and locally during a country-wide lockdown.David Clark told the prime minister on Thursday night that he had driven to a park 2km from his Dunedin home.“I spoke to the health minister last night, who apologised to me,” Ardern said in a statement.   Related: New Zealand site to report Covid-19 rule-breakers crashes amid spike in lockdown anger    “It’s my expectation that ministers set the standards we are asking New Zealanders to follow. People can go outside to get fresh air and drive short distances if needed, but we have asked people to avoid activities where there is a higher risk of injury, and the minister should have followed that guidance.” New Zealand is in a level-4 lockdown to stem the spread of Covid-19, where citizens have been told to stay home and businesses told to close their premises unless they are an essential service. But on Thursday Clark’s van, which has his name and face emblazoned across it, was photographed by a passerby who then passed it on to local media.He confirmed in a statement that he had gone mountain biking.“This was my only chance to get out for some exercise in daylight hours ... The track itself is not challenging, and is widely used by families and foot traffic. I know that now is not the time for people to be engaging in higher-risk exercise activities.   Related: 'Overwhelming': British hiker emerges from wilderness to find New Zealand in grip of Covid-19    “I don’t want to give anyone the perception that I take these matters lightly. This is a reminder to me to think carefully about how best to fit some exercise into my new-normal routine.”The director general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, said that anyone undertaking physical activity should be doing that safely.The finance minister, Grant Robertson, told media that people shouldn’t put themselves in danger and Clark knew that he had done something wrong. He said that Clark should not resign over the issue and an apology sufficed.“He needs to lead by example, and he didn’t do that in this case. On Friday, the government announced 49 new confirmed cases and 22 probable cases of Covid-19 in the country, taking the total number of cases to 868."
17,health,Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's health improves despite coronavirus fears,"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s health is improving after fears last week that she had contracted coronavirus while in prison in Tehran. However, her family have said she has not been tested and a promise of temporary release made last week by prison officers has not materialised, causing her deep distress. Many prisoners in Iran are being released temporarily amid fears that the disease will spread rapidly inside prisons if it takes a grip, but the offer of release applies only to prisoners with sentences of less than five years. Most political prisoners are serving longer sentences. Following the suggestion that she was to be released, Zaghari-Ratcliffe went so far as to pack her bags in preparation last Wednesday. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, accused the Iranians of playing mind games and urged the British government to demand her full release. In a lengthy statement released by the Free Nazanin campaign, Ratcliffe said: “[The doctor] confirmed to her that her symptoms were clearly a virus and were consistent with coronavirus but he also confessed he was unable to test her with a testing kit. “The doctor, however, did reassure Nazanin that since her symptoms had stabilised it was likely a positive sign that she was hopefully soon going to start to recover.” Zaghari Ratcliffe saw the doctor last Monday soon after her husband had raised fears about her symptoms. She was told last Wednesday by the deputy prosecutor that she was being considered for temporary release by the prosecutor, and informed her release could happen either later that day or Thursday.  But over the weekend she was informed that her release was not imminent. Six other prisoners have been released from her ward, and four given a date for their release.  Reflecting on the impact on her family in Britain, the campaign said: “The effect is a kind of gaslighting, raising hopes before promises are not kept, and then a kind of guilt and self-blame, as the regime manages another distraction and avoids accountability for its acts of abuse. “Cumulatively the experience is not just cruel and degrading. The cumulative effect – of promising to release and failing to do so, again and again – is a kind of mental torture. That is its design. “The fact Nazanin’s temporary release has not happened when promised so publicly indicates blockages and offstage power games – between different parts of the Iranian regime, between Iran and the UK.” Ratcliffe said: “Dangling publicly the idea of furlough without yet carrying it through has been an act of media management by the Iranian authorities. It has aimed at distracting media attention from the refusal to test for coronavirus, and the fact thousands of prisoners, including British ones, have just been left in harm’s way.” Ratcliffe expressed anger that some UK government ministers had repeated false Iranian government claims that she had been tested. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in prison over allegations, which she denies, of plotting to overthrow the Tehran government. Last week a Foreign Office spokesman said: “We are urgently seeking information from the Iranian authorities on reports that coronavirus is spreading in Evin prison. We call on the Iranian government to immediately allow health professionals into Evin prison to assess the situation of British-Iranian dual nationals there.”"
18,health,China's coronavirus health code apps raise concerns over privacy,"As millions of people in China emerge from weeks of lockdown, their freedom of movement is largely dependent on phone apps. The “health code” service – run on the ubiquitous platforms Alipay and WeChat and developed for the Chinese government – give users colour-coded designations based on their health status and travel history, and a QR code that can be scanned by authorities. The apps are specific to each city or province, but generally people given a green code are allowed to travel relatively freely. A yellow code indicates that the holder should be in home isolation, and a red code says the user is a confirmed Covid-19 patient and should be in quarantine. The apps have become an integral part of Chinese authorities’ management of people and their movements in and out of affected areas. When lockdown restrictions in Hubei province were lifted last week, the government allowed residents with a green code to travel within and out of the province.   Related: China gets mixed results in its attempt to lift lockdown    Some restaurants, shops, hotels and other establishments ask for patrons to show their codes before entering. In Wuhan, only those with a green health code are allowed to take public transport. However, the technology has raised concerns about their reach into people’s private lives and data. There have been complaints by Chinese social media users about a lack of transparency over how the app works and what data it is storing. Some have reported being unable to change erroneous “red” designations, and questioned the reliance on internet connection and surveillance. “Why should you let companies such as Alipay and WeChat monitor and trace you with the health code?” said one user. “Can’t it be integrated into the chip of our ID card? And some people’s mobile phones are not connected to the internet. I don’t know what leaders are thinking?” The apps rely on a combination of self-reporting by the user and government information, including a person’s medical records, their travel history and if they have been in contact with someone diagnosed with Covid-19. According to screenshots of an English-language version of the Alipay app, applicants are asked for contact and passport details and recent travel, and for relevant medical certification. Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba that operates Alipay, said that it does not provide or operate the service and has no access to the data entered into it. The company said it provided technical support to the Hangzhou city government when it was developing its version of the software. Official guidelines for the WeChat app say it takes basic identity and address details as well as “the history of close contact with suspected patients, history of travel and residence outside the resident”. It draws on medical information including “symptoms (such as fever, cough), medical treatment, isolated observation, contact information, travel history of the epidemic area”, and the user’s travel history including the mode of travel and what seat they sat in, and details on the vehicle and its driver. The health code app, launched in Hangzhou in early February, and described by state media as “Alipay Health code” spread to more than 100 cities within a week before it was rolled out nationally.

19,health,Bolsonaro threatens to sack health minister over coronavirus criticism,"Jair Bolsonaro has reportedly told his health minister he will sack him if he dares criticise his handling of the coronavirus crisis. According to a report in the Estado de São Paulo newspaper, the Brazilian president’s warning came during a top-level meeting on Saturday as the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the country rose to more than 3,900 and the death toll hit 114. The health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, reportedly informed Brazil’s far-right leader he would have no choice but to publicly criticise him if he insisted on going out in public despite warnings to stay indoors.   Related: Bolsonaro says he 'wouldn't feel anything' if infected with Covid-19 and attacks state lockdowns    “Bolsonaro replied that, if he did so, he would fire him,” the conservative newspaper reported, citing anonymous sources. Bolsonaro’s downplaying of coronavirus – and his public call for Brazil to relax quarantine measures and get back to work – have appalled critics and many citizens, sparking nightly pot-banging protests in major cities. On Friday, the president shrugged his shoulders at the likely deaths, telling an interviewer: “Some will die. I’m sorry. That’s life.” Estado de São Paulo said that at Saturday’s summit – which was also attended by Brazil’s justice and defence ministers – Mandetta tried to convince Bolsonaro of the gravity of the situation. He reportedly said: “Are we ready for the worst-case scenario, with army trucks transporting bodies through the streets? And cameras livestreaming that on the internet?” Mandetta, who is an orthopaedic doctor, noted that even 1,000 deaths would be the equivalent of four Boeing aircraft crashes. Experts believe far more people are likely to die. Recent modelling by researchers from Imperial College London suggested Brazil could have more than 1.1 million Covid-19 deaths if no action were taken to control the pandemic; 529,000 if only elderly people were forced to isolate; and 44,200 if drastic measures were implemented.       Bolsonaro’s efforts to undermine regional governments’ efforts to enforce such shutdowns have sparked a political rebellion by the governors of nearly all of Brazil’s 27 states. Speaking to the Guardian last week, Flávio Dino, the leftwing governor of Maranhão, criticised Bolsonaro’s denial of the dangers of coronavirus and his “catastrophic” dawdling. “If you’re on a battlefield and don’t know which weapon to use, which direction to shoot, and when to open fire, you expose the whole army to serious harm,” Dino said."
20,health,Watchdog opens NMC Health inquiry amid accounting scandal,"The financial watchdog has launched a formal investigation into NMC Health hours after shares in the FTSE 100 healthcare group were suspended from trading amid a deepening accounting scandal. The news of the investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority came the day after Abu Dhabi-based NMC removed its chief executive and placed its finance chief on extended sick leave as its own investigation into its finances continues. NMC’s shares have lost two-thirds of their value since the US-based short-seller Muddy Waters questioned its financial statements in December. The firm, which runs private hospitals and health services in the United Arab Emirates, has also admitted it is unclear who controls its biggest shareholdings.   Related: Healthcare empire NMC should be clear about who owns its shares | Nils Pratley    This week NMC shared details of an independent review of the firm’s finances, led by a former FBI director. The review revealed that companies controlled by NMC’s founder and another executive had accessed $335m (£260m) in secret financing since early 2018, without the knowledge of the company’s board, and which did not appear on its balance sheet. The review found that companies which accessed the supply chain financing are apparently linked to NMC’s founder, the Indian-born billionaire Bavaguthu Raghuram Shetty, and its major shareholder and former deputy chair, Khaleefa Al Muhairi. In a statement issued on Thursday, Muhairi rejected all allegations of wrongdoing and insisted: “I have not been given a reasonable opportunity to engage with and assist the investigation with the benefit of the key documentation relating to the events in question, as I would have wished.” The healthcare group said the FCA had agreed to a temporary suspension of its shares on Thursday “to ensure the smooth operation of the market”. It has said it will continue to cooperate with the financial regulator “and any and all other relevant authorities”.     Prasanth Manghat. Photograph: NMC    Following the removal on Wednesday of NMC’s chief executive, Prasanth Manghat, the founder of Muddy Waters, Carson Block, said: “At this point, the company’s announcements speak for themselves and seem to be even more damning than our initial report was.” A fresh investigation into a FTSE 100-listed company will also raise questions about London’s governance of firms listed on its stock exchange, following scandals concerning the mining companies ENRC and Bumi."
21,health,WHO declares coronavirus  a global health emergency,"The Wuhan coronavirus outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared, but he warned governments not to impose travel or trade restrictions on China. 
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the organization decided to declare an emergency, which gives WHO greater powers to direct the response, because of the danger that coronavirus could be devastating if it spreads to countries with weak public health systems. He emphasised that the move was no reflection on China, adding that the country’s response had saved the world from many more cases and deaths. 
 
  Related: Coronavirus deaths leap in China as countries struggle to evacuate citizens  
 
Of the 9,320 confirmed cases so far, only 98 have been outside China, he said. 
“So far we have not seen any deaths outside China, for which we must be grateful,” said Tedros. “Although these numbers are relatively small compared to the number of cases in China, we must act together now to limit further spread.” 
“Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems which are ill prepared to deal with it,” said Tedros. “The decision is not a vote of no confidence in China.” 
The emergencies committee, which advises the director-general, made a series of recommendations. Tedros said the first of these was that “there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade.” It also said that it was important to combat the rumours and misinformation circulating about the outbreak. 
“In the past few weeks we have witnessed the emergence of a previously unknown pathogen which has escalated into an unprecedented outbreak and which has been met by an unprecedented response,” said Tedros. “China is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken to contain the outbreak despite the severe social and economic impact that is is having on China.” 
In the UK, the chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland responded by increasing their risk assessment from low to moderate. “This does not mean we think the risk to individuals in the UK has changed at this stage, but that government should plan for all eventualities,” they said in a statement. 
“As we have previously said, it is likely there will be individual cases and we are confident in the ability of the NHS and HSC in Northern Ireland to manage these in a way that protects the public and provides high-quality care.” 
Dr Jeremy Farrar, the director of health foundation Wellcome, said the WHO had made the right call. “Countries, public health teams and researchers worldwide have been acting on this with the very highest level of concern for the last few weeks. But this virus has spread at unprecedented scale and speed, with cases passing between people in multiple countries across the world,” he said. 
“Declaration of an international emergency will undoubtedly sharpen governments’ focus on protecting citizens. But we must also step up as an international community to make sure no one is left behind – with all interventions, including public health measures, diagnostics, treatments and vaccines available to everyone. This will challenge the best-resourced countries but will have disproportionate impact on fragile health systems in low- and middle-income countries.” 
Most people who have fallen sick in other countries have travelled from China’s Hubei province. So far there has been only a very small number of cases in these countries of transmission from person to person – the development that health experts most fear. 
The United States reported human-to-human transmission on Thursday. The man who became unwell in the US is married to a 60-year-old Chicago woman who became sick from the virus after she returned from a trip to Wuhan. There has also been human-to-human transmission in Vietnam, Japan and Germany. 
In China, the health chief of Huanggang city, which has reported 500 cases – second only to Wuhan – was sacked by the Chinese government following public anger over her inability to answer questions about the outbreak on state television. 
Tang Zhihong floundered when questioned by a central government inspection team and a reporter. Asked how many sick people there were in one of the hospitals, she replied: “I don’t know, I’m unclear. I only know how many beds there are. Don’t ask me how many people are being treated.” 
Her TV appearance generated more than half-a-million comments on the Weibo account of state television’s news channel, most of them angry. A few hours after the programme aired, the city’s health department said in a terse and brief statement that Tang had been removed. It gave no other details. 
The US and Japan have started evacuating citizens, while other countries are poised to send chartered flights to Wuhan city – the centre of the outbreak in Hubei – amid reports that some evacuations had been held up by delays in obtaining permission from the Chinese authorities.

The first British flight to evacuate citizens will carry about 150 British nationals and 50 other people, mainly from the EU. The flight is scheduled to leave Wuhan at 5am local time on Friday for RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. It is understood that the British passengers will be taken to a former NHS facility in the Wirral and quarantined for 14 days. 
Australia is yet to receive permission from the Chinese government to evacuate hundreds of its citizens, and New Zealand has launched a separate rescue mission, though a timeline remains unclear. 
France, South Korea and other countries are also removing their citizens or making plans to do so. About 250 French citizens and 100 other Europeans are scheduled to be flown out of Wuhan on two French planes this week. 
In Italy, a cruise ship’s 6,000 passengers were kept onboard while tests were conducted on two Chinese travellers. 
In Moscow, the Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin issued a decree ordering the temporary closure of the country’s border with China, which extends for 2,600 miles (4,200km). The border had been de facto closed because of the lunar new-year holiday, but authorities said the closure would be extended until 1 March. All train traffic between the two countries, except for one train connecting Moscow and Beijing, was stopped on Thursday."
22,health,Trump halts funding to World Health Organization – as it happened," 
  2.05am BST  
 Summary 
  
   
   Donald Trump announced that the administration is going to halt funding to the World Health Organization, at least temporarily. Trump said the WHO had “failed in its basic duty and it must be held accountable” during his daily coronavirus briefing.  
   Barack Obama officially endorsed Joe Biden’s presidential bid. Obama said in the widely expected endorsement that his former vice-president has “all the qualities we need in a president right now”. 
   Dr Anthony Fauci said “we’re not there yet” on reopening the economy. The infectious disease expert said that the country needed to develop a better system to quickly identify and isolate coronavirus patients before states could start relaxing stay-at-home orders. 
   The government agreed a $25bn bailout for the airline industry. The aid will allow passenger airlines to continue paying salaries to their workers.

  1.09am BST  
  
  Donald Trump has blamed the World Health Organization for failures in the initial response to the coronavirus pandemic, even threatening to cut its funding, but most health experts say it has performed well with limited resources. 
  Accusing the WHO of giving bad advice, being “China-centric” and even withholding information, Trump claimed to have stopped US funding in a press briefing on Tuesday, only to claim a few minutes later that he was just considering it, pending a review of its performance. 
  In fact, the US is already about $200m in arrears in assessed contributions (national membership fees). It has given more in donations, and was the biggest single donor in 2019 – certainly far more than China, which gives a paltry amount given the size of its economy. 
  But the US is far from providing the majority of the WHO’s funds, as Trump claimed, and its voluntary contributions have largely been tied to specific projects. WHO’s total annual budget is about $2.5bn, and contributions from member states have not significantly increased over three decades. 
  “The WHO’s budget is around the equivalent of a large US hospital, which is utterly incommensurate with its global responsibilities,” said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law professor at Georgetown University. “So, if the US president were a global health leader, he’d be leading a call to at minimum double the WHO budget in the face of this pandemic.”

  Fact check: Travel restrictions  
  Trump has repeatedly touted his travel restrictions as evidence that he reacted early to the coronavirus threat. We’ve addressed this several times on the liveblog over the past few weeks, but here we go again... 
  The administration’s travel policy did not “cut off” all travel from China, as Trump claims. Although non-US citizens were prohibited from entering the country if they had traveled to China within the previous two weeks, American citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family members were exempt. Similarly, Trump’s European travel restrictions exempted citizens, residents and their families. And initially, the restrictions didn’t apply to the UK and Ireland, as well as most Eastern European countries. 
  Epidemiologists have told the Guardian that these policies likely had little impact, as they were enacted after the virus was already spreading within the US. “Unfortunately, travel bans sound good,” noted Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard’s TH Chan School of Public Health, after Trump announced European restrictions. “But we’re way past the point where simply restricting travel is a reasonable response.” 
  The few studies so far that have investigated the impact of travel restrictions have found that such policies may have at best delayed the spread of disease by a few days or weeks. A recent article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that travel restrictions and airport screenings in several countries “likely slowed the rate of exportation from mainland China to other countries, but are insufficient to contain the global spread of Covid-19. And in China, where officials shut down travel both in and out of Wuhan, the city where the Covid-19 outbreak began, the travel ban barely slowed the spread of diseases, according to a report published in Science. 
  There is no evidence that travel restrictions significantly reduced the contagion’s death toll.

  Fact check: Tariffs  
  “China has paid us tens of billions of dollars” to the US in tariffs, the president said, reviving one of his favorite rally lines.  
  This is not how tariffs work — tariffs are taxes on goods coming into the US. 
  Moreover, here’s what economists from Princeton, Columbia and the Federal Reserve of New York concluded from an analysis of how Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods have played out:  
   
   Although in principle the effect of higher tariffs on domestic prices could be offset by foreign exporters lowering the pre-tariff prices that they charge for these goods, we find little evidence of such an improvement in the terms of trade up to now, which implies that the full incidence of the tariff has fallen on domestic consumers so far. Our results imply that the tariff revenue the U.S. is now collecting is insufficient to compensate the losses being born by the consumers of imports.

  Fact check: presidential authority 
  “The plans to reopen the country are close to being finalized and we will soon be sharing details and new guidelines with everybody,” the president said, adding that he’ll be “authorizing” governors to reopen businesses and scale back distancing based on their own judgment. This is an authority that governors already have.  
  University of Texas law professor Steve Vladeck noted on Twitter the same day that: “The president has no formal legal authority to categorically override local or state shelter-in-place orders or to reopen schools and small businesses. No statute delegates to him such power; no constitutional provision invests him with such authority.” 
  When previously asked about whether he would issue a national stay at home order, the president deferred to the governors. 
  On Monday 13 April, the governors of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Delaware and Connecticut announced they had formed a regional advisory council. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said each state would name a public health official and an economic development official to serve on a working group alongside each governor’s chief of staff to design a “reopening plan” for their states. 
  Shortly afterward, the states of California, Washington and Oregon announced a similar plan.

  Fact check: Economy 
  The US has “the greatest economy anywhere in the world,” Trump boasted. “The greatest economy in the history of the world.” 
  This is false. While the economy was doing well before the pandemic struck, there have been periods when it was doing even better. And economist say that the threat of a trade war with China, tension in the middle east and the Federal Reserve’s slashing of interest rates were early signs that trouble was brewing even before the coronavirus crisis.  
  In 2019, the GDP has an average growth rate for 2.3%. Under the Obama administration, the growth rate was at a peak of 5.5% during the second quarter of 2014. During the 50s and 60s, the growth rate was even better.

  Adam Boehler, a friend of Jared Kushner and administration official spoke briefly at the podium. “There are over 60,000 ventilators at hospitals that are not in use,” he said – so the government has launched a program to move ventilators where they’re needed. “There has been no American who has needed a ventilator that hasn’t recieved one,” Boehler said.  
  We’re working on fact-checking Boehler’s absolute claim – it’s nearly impossible to verify (though if you, reader, have heard of anyone being denied – please reach out on Twitter @maanvisings). In the meantime, here’s what we know about ventilator shortages in the US: 
  It is true that some states, so far, have ended up with more ventilators than they originally projected they would need. California has loaned 500 ventilators to states like New York. California hospitals managed to increase their stock from 7,500 machines to more than 11,000, according to the state’s governor, Gavin Newsom. “That has put less strain and pressure on the state’s effort to procure additional ventilators,” Newsom said. 
  However, that doesn’t mean that there isn’t a national shortage. The US has roughly 173,000 ventilators, according to the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University. Experts from Harvard Medical School predict that the US could end up needing 31 times that number to treat coronavirus patients.  
  An article in the New England Journal of Medicine published on Wednesday 25 March categorically concluded that the US does not have enough ventilators to treat patients with Covid-19 in the coming months. 
  The authors, American public health experts, wrote: “There is a broad range of estimates of the number of ventilators we will need to care for U.S. patients with Covid-19, from several hundred thousand to as many as a million. The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included. The national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap. No matter which estimate we use, there are not enough ventilators for patients with Covid-19 in the upcoming months.”

  Trump also based the WHO for praising China’s “transparency”. 
  But the president himself praised China’s transparency — on January 24.

  Trump said that the WHO at some point implied that the coronavirus was “not communicable” — there is no evidence that the organization did that.  
  He also said “there was credible” information in December to suspect human-to-human transmission and the WHO did not respond appropriately. “So much death has been caused by their mistakes,” he said.  
  But Trump himself ignored and undermined the severity of the crisis well into March.  
  The president was warned at the end of January by one of his top White House advisers that coronavirus had the potential to kill hundreds of thousands of Americans and derail the US economy, unless tough action were taken immediately, new memos have revealed. 
  The memos were written by Trump’s economic adviser, Peter Navarro, and circulated via the National Security Council widely around the White House and federal agencies. They show that even within the Trump administration alarm bells were ringing by late January, at a time when the president was consistently downplaying the threat of Covid-19. 
  Moreover, the US intelligence community, public health experts and officials in Trump’s own administration had warned for years that the country was at risk from a pandemic, including specific warnings about a coronavirus outbreak. 
  An October 2019 draft report by the Department of Health and Human Services, obtained by the New York Times: “drove home just how underfunded, underprepared and uncoordinated the federal government would be for a life-or-death battle with a virus for which no treatment existed,” the Times reported.

  Fact check: WHO 
  Trump has accused the WHO of “severely mismanaging and covering up” the coronavirus crisis.  
  The WHO has been criticized for a 14 January tweet, which Trump has referenced, that noted that a preliminary investigation by Chinese officials found no evidence of human-to-human transmission. However, by 30 January, the organization declared coronavirus a “public health emergency”, and went on to declare a pandemic on 11 March after numerous countries - including the US and UK - failed to follow its advice. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus spoke of “alarming levels of inaction” from many countries. 
  The WHO “has been drained of power and resources”, said Richard Horton, editor of the influential medical journal the Lancet. “Its coordinating authority and capacity are weak. Its ability to direct an international response to a life-threatening epidemic is non-existent.” 
  The Trump administration and the president himself repeatedly played down the crisis - specifically downplaying the threat to the US, inaccurately compared it to the flu and told his supporters that growing worries about the coronavirus was a “hoax”. 
  By the time Trump announced travel restrictions from China on 31 January, most major airlines had already suspended flights, following the lead of several major international carriers that had stopped due to the outbreak. In late February, the president said the spread of Covid-19 in the US was not inevitable and the danger to Americans “remains very low”. He predicted that the number of cases diagnosed in the country, just 15 that time, could fall to zero in “a few days”.

  Between 10 and 20 percent of coronavirus cases are health workers, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But doctors, nurses and other medical professionals infected with the virus tended to be hospitalized at lower rates than other patients.  
  Here’s more from the AP:  
   
   The CDC had reports of more than 315,000 cases in the U.S. The new report focused on about 49,000 for which researchers had data on whether or not they worked in health care. About 9,300, or 19%, of them were medical professionals. That included 27 who died. 
   But the data varied in how complete it was, researchers said. In 12 states that did a better job reporting on whether patients worked in medicine, around 11% of cases were health care workers. 
   Compared with U.S. cases overall, larger proportions of diagnosed health care workers were women, were white, and were young or middle-aged adults. That’s consistent with the demographics of who works in health care, researchers said. 
   About 10% of the health care workers were hospitalized with symptoms, compared with 21% to 31% of overall cases. That may reflect the younger age of the workers, as well as prioritization of testing for health care employees, the report said.

  White House coronavirus briefing shortly 
  We’re awaiting Donald Trump and his coronavirus task force’s regular press/public briefing, which was due to begin at 5pm ET but, as is becoming very typical, running late. 
  Yesterday it kicked off at around 5.50pm and lasted almost two and a half hours, probably a record. It was also extraordinary.

 Today so far 
  
  That’s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. 
  Here’s where the day stands so far: 
   
   The US coronavirus death toll has surpassed 25,000. The US has confirmed nearly 600,000 cases of coronavirus across the country, and 25,239 Americans have died of the virus. 
   New York governor Andrew Cuomo said Trump was “clearly spoiling for a fight” on reopening the economy. Cuomo said Trump’s claim that he has “total” authority to reopen the economy is “factually wrong,” and the governor emphasized he would not be pressured into reopening the economy before it was safe to do so. 
   California governor Gavin Newsom established criteria for reopening the economy. Newsom declined to set a date for relaxing California’s stay-at-home order, but he said the state needs to expand testing and develop a system for contact tracing before restrictions can be eased. 
   Barack Obama officially endorsed Joe Biden’s presidential bid. Obama said Biden “has all the qualities we need in a president right now,” and he indicated he would soon stump for his former vice president on the campaign trail. 
   Dr Anthony Fauci said the country would likely not be ready to start reopening the economy in the next couple of weeks. The infectious disease expert emphasized that the nation needed to develop a robust system to test and track coronavirus patients before easing social distancing guidelines. “We have to have something in place that is efficient and that we can rely on, and we’re not there yet,” Fauci said.

  The 2017 sale of Republican senator Richard Burr’s Washington town home to a lobbyist and longtime donor is attracting scutiny. 
  ProPublica reports: 
   
    Burr sold the small townhouse, in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, for what, by some estimates, was an above market price — $900,000 — to a team led by lobbyist John Green. That is tens of thousands of dollars above some estimates of the property’s value by tax assessors, a real estate website and a local real estate agent. The sale was done off-market, without the home being listed for sale publicly. 
   Green is a longtime donor to Burr’s political campaigns and has co-hosted at least one fundraiser for him. In 2017, the year of the sale, Green lobbied on behalf of a stream of clients with business before Burr’s committees. 
   
  If Green purchased the home at an above market price, it could be considered a gift to Burr, which could run afoul of Senate ethics rules. 
  Burr recently attracted ethical scrutiny for his stock activity in February, when he was receiving briefings on the coronavirus outbreak, which raised concerns that he had attempted to profit off a public health emergency. 
  Moreover, there’s this!

  New York City’s coronavirus death toll surged past 10,000 after officials added in people who were suspected to have died of the virus but were never tested. 
  The New York Times reports: 
   
    New York City, already an epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, sharply increased its death toll by more than 3,700 on Tuesday, after officials said they were now including people who had never tested positive for the virus but were presumed to have died because of it. 
   The new figures, released by the city’s Health Department, drove up the number of people killed in New York City to more than 10,000 and appeared to increase the overall United States fatality rate by 17 percent, to more than 26,000. 
   The numbers brought into clearer focus the staggering toll the virus has already taken on the largest city in the United States, where deserted streets are haunted by the near-constant howl of ambulance sirens. 
   Far more people have died in New York City on a per-capita basis than in Italy, the European country with the most deaths. 
   
  New York state already accounted for about 40% of all coronavirus deaths in the country, with governor Andrew Cuomo saying today that the state’s death toll has reached 10,834.

  The Guardian’s Vivian Ho reports on the latest from California: 
  California governor Gavin Newsom unveiled the plan to reopen the economy as the state experienced a record number of covid-related deaths: 758.  
  State models still predict that California will experience its peak in hospitalizations mid-May. “We are sober about the fact that we’re still seeing in increase, modest though it may be, in hospitalizations,” Newsom said. “We are not out of the woods yet. We are not spiking the ball yet. But we are also acknowledging that this is not going to be a permanent state.” 
  Newsom warned that even when he modifies the order and the state is allowed to return to “normal,” the new normal may still be different. Waiters at restaurants may wear masks and gloves. Gatherings of more than 100 will still be unlikely without a vaccine.  
  “There’s no light switch here,” he said. “I would argue it’s more like a dimmer.” He predicted in two weeks, should the state see a continual decline in hospitalizations, he may have a better idea of when he may begin modifying the order.  
  “We can’t get ahead of ourselves,” Newsom said. “Let’s not make a mistake of pulling the plug too early, as much as we all want to. I don’t want to make a political decision that puts people’s lives at risk, puts the economy at risk.”

 Newsom outlines criteria for reopening economy 
  
  The Guardian’s Vivian Ho reports on the latest from California: 
  California governor Gavin Newsom provided a pragmatic glimpse into the future of the state on Tuesday, admitting that though there was no specific timeline for when he will lift the stay-at-home order, “there is a ray of optimism that this too shall pass.” 
  California is preparing to enter a new “optimistic” phase of the coronavirus crisis, one where “we begin to transition into suppression, ultimately on our way to herd immunity and ultimately to a vaccine,” Newsom said. It’s in this phase that conversations about reopening the state and returning to normal operations will begin, he said.  
  “This phase is one where science, where public health, not politics, must be the guide,” Newsom said.  
  He outlined the six indicators that the state must consider before modifying the stay-at-home order: 
   
   The ability to expand testing and address contact tracing, isolating, and supporting those who are positive or exposed. 
   The ability to protect the most vulnerable populations - seniors, the homeless, and those with underlying medical conditions - from infection and spread. 
   The ability of the hospital and health systems to handle surges. 
   The ability to develop therapeutics to meet the demand. 
   The ability for businesses, schools, parks, playgrounds, child care facilities and coastlines to support physical distancing. 
   The ability to determine when to reinstitute “more vigorous controls”, such as the stay-at-home orders, if necessary.

  At a Pentagon briefing today, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, was asked about reports and rumours that the coronavirus could have originated in a Chinese laboratory.  
  Republican senator Tom Cotton has raised the possibility that the outbreak could have come from a safety lapse at a microbiology lab, or might even be engineered as a bioweapon. The Washington Post foreign affairs columnist Josh Rogin reported today about state department cables from 2018 in which US diplomats expressed concern about safety at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was conducting studies on bat-borne coronavirus strains. 
  “There’s a lot of rumour and speculation in a wide variety of media, blog sites, etc,” Milley told reporters. “It should be no surprise to you that we’ve taken a keen interest in that, and we’ve had a lot of intelligence look at that. And I would just say at this point, it’s inconclusive, although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural. But we don’t know for certain.”  
  A Pew Research Center poll released yesterday showed that about a third of Americans believe coronavirus was most likely created by humans in a laboratory, while 43% say it most likely came about naturally.

  “Liberty University is, in a very real sense, profiting from the COVID-19 pandemic—keeping its campus and campus services ‘open’ as a pretext to retain Plaintiff’s and the other Class members’ room, board and campus fees, despite no longer having to incur the full cost of providing those services, all the while putting students’ finances and health at risk,” the plaintiff, identified only as “Student A” in the lawsuit, alleged. 
  The university’s president, prominent Trump ally Jerry Falwell Jr, downplayed the pandemic for weeks before finally announcing a shift to online instruction on March 23. However, the school has kept its residence halls and dining facilities open, offering students only a $1,000 credit if they chose to leave their campus housing. 
  “Liberty’s decision to tell its students that they could remain on campus to continue to use their housing, meal plans, parking, and the benefits of the services and activities for which their fees paid, was not only illusory and empty—because there were no more on-campus classes—but it was also extremely dangerous and irresponsible,” Student A said in the lawsuit.

  More Cuomo news, in this case about Chris Cuomo, CNN anchor, Covid-19 patient and brother of New York governor Andrew Cuomo.  
  The headline on the Murdoch-owned New York Post’s write-up of Chris Cuomo’s words on his SiriusXM radio show on Monday night is “Coronavirus-stricken Chris Cuomo trashes CNN gig during radio show meltdown”. And it’s true that the younger Cuomo, who has been in isolation though continuing to work since contracting the coronavirus, seems to be having some vaguely existential thoughts: 
   
   I don’t want to spend my time doing things that I don’t think are valuable enough to me personally,” Cuomo said. “I don’t value indulging irrationality, hyper-partisanship.” 
   
  The Post also detailed a confrontation Cuomo said he had with a “loser biker” outside his home on Easter Sunday. 
  But I’m going to single out what Cuomo, 49, said about the state of US politics today: he is growing weary of “talking to Democrats about things that I don’t really believe they mean” and “talking to Republicans about them parroting things they feel they have to say”. 
  The Post also reports that Cuomo “also wants to stop analyzing the president, ‘who we all know is full of shit by design’.” 
  As it happens, the Post wrote “s–t”. The Guardian knows of no such Puritan strictures. 
  Donald Trump has attacked Chris Cuomo before – of course he has. So we might expect further tweets or maybe remarks at today’s White House briefing, which is scheduled for 5pm.

  “If I had been able to just make a few comments and then go to work, that would have really been much better,” Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, told the AP.  
  Yesterday’s briefing, during which Trump falsely claimed he has “total” authority to reopen the economy, ran for nearly two and a half hours. “It isn’t the idea of being there and answering questions, which I really think is important for the American public,” Fauci said. “It’s the amount of time.”

  Trump has made more than 18,000 false or misleading claims since taking office, according to an analysis by the Washington Post. 
  Since the first confirmed coronavirus case in the US was confirmed on January 20, the president has been making an average of about 23 false or misleading claims a day. 
  The Post reports: 
   
    When we last updated our database of President Trump’s false or misleading claims, it was on Jan. 19, the end of his third year as president. The president’s most frequently repeated false claim was that he presided over the best economy in the history of the United States. 
   The next day, the first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus was reported in the United States. So, with this update through April 3, we’ve added a new category — coronavirus — that already has more than 350 items. Much has changed in the world, with stay-at-home orders, massive economic disruption and topsy-turvy securities markets, but one thing has remained constant — the president’s prolific twisting of the truth. 
   As of April 3, Trump’s 1,170th day in office, our database shows that he has made 18,000 false or misleading claims. That’s an average of more than 15 claims a day, though since our last update 75 days ago, he’s been averaging just over 23 claims a day. That’s slightly higher than the 22 a day he recorded in 2019.

Cuomo said Trump’s claim that he has “total” authority to reopen the economy was “factually wrong,” and the governor said he would not be pressured into reopening New York’s economy if he thought it would jeopardize public health. 
   Barack Obama officially endorsed Joe Biden’s presidential bid. Obama said in the widely expected endorsement that his former vice president has “all the qualities we need in a president right now.” 
   
   
    
    
     
    
    
   
   
   Dr Anthony Fauci said “we’re not there yet” on reopening the economy. The infectious disease expert said that the country needed to develop a better system to quickly identify and isolate coronavirus patients before states could start relaxing stay-at-home orders.

 Fauci: 'We're not there yet' on reopening the economy 
  
  Dr Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease specialist, said he doesn’t think the US is in a position to start reopening in the next couple of weeks. 
  Fauci said that May 1 might be “a bit overly optimistic” as a target date to reopen the economy, even as Trump reportedly looks to begin that process by the end of the month. 
  “We have to have something in place that is efficient and that we can rely on, and we’re not there yet,” Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the AP of the country’s testing capacities.

  Fauci warned that areas will likely see a surge of infections when social distancing guidelines are relaxed, so the country needs to develop a robust testing operation to identify and isolate those new patients. 
  “I’ll guarantee you, once you start pulling back there will be infections,” Fauci said. “It’s how you deal with the infections that’s going [to] count.”

 Cuomo briefing summary 
  
  New York governor Andrew Cuomo just wrapped up his daily briefing on the state’s response to coronavirus. 
  Here’s some of what he said: 
   
   Cuomo said Trump was “clearly spoiling for a fight” on reopening the economy. Cuomo said Trump’s claim that he has “total” authority to reopen the economy was “factually wrong,” and the governor insisted he would not be drawn into a partisan fight amid a pandemic. 
   
   
    
    
     
    
    
   
   
   New York recorded 778 coronavirus deaths yesterday. The figure marks an increase fom Sunday’s death toll, and the state’s total coronavirus death toll has reached 10,834. 
   Cuomo said he believes New York is at the apex of its crisis. Coronavirus hospitalizations slightly decreasd yesterday, Cuomo said, even as 1,600 new people were admitted to New York hospitals. The small tick down shows more people are being discharged from hospitals after recovering from the virus. 
   Nursing homes are an “increasing issue” in the state, Cuomo said. The governor warned that the rate of coronavirus deaths in New York’s nursing homes is higher than that of the state’s hospitals.

  Notably, Barack Obama did not mention Trump by name in his endorsement of Joe Biden, but the former president assailed Republicans, saying they are not interested in “progress”, only “power”.  
  “Repeatedly, they’ve disregarded American principles of rule of law, and voting rights, and transparency – basic norms that previous administrations observed regardless of party – principles that are the bedrock of our democracy,” Obama said. “The other side has a massive war chest. The other side has a propaganda network with little regard for the truth,” he continued. “On the other hand, pandemics have a way of cutting through a lot of noise and spin to remind us of what is real, and what is important.”He signed off by vowing: “I’ll see you on the campaign trail as soon as I can.”

 Obama officially endorses Biden's presidential bid 
  
  Barack Obama has officially endorsed his former vice president, Joe Biden.  
  “Choosing Joe to be my Vice President was one of the best decisions I ever made, and he became a close friend,” the former president said in a 12-minute video published on Tuesday. “And I believe Joe has all the qualities we need in a President right now.”

  Obama praised Biden’s rivals as “talented and decent”, and said Biden would be a better nominee for having competed in “one of the most impressive Democratic fields ever.”  
  In his remarks, Obama singled out Bernie Sanders, who he called an “American original.” 
  “He and I haven’t always agreed on everything, but we’ve always shared a conviction that we have to make America a fairer, more just, more equitable society,” Obama said of Sanders, adding: “The ideas he’s championed; the energy and enthusiasm he inspired, especially in young people, will be critical in moving America in a direction of progress and hope.”Obama also made reference to the criticism of his presidency and agreed that “structural change,” a term popularized by senator Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign, was needed to combat the “vast inequalities created by the new economy”.  
  “If I were running today, I wouldn’t run the same race or have the same platform as I did in 2008,” he said. “The world is different; there’s too much unfinished business for us to just look backwards.”

  New York governor Andrew Cuomo emphasized he hoped to work with Trump and the federal government in “partnership” and “coordination” to respond to the current crisis. 
  “I am not going to fight with him,” Cuomo said of the president. “This is no time for any division between the federal government and state governments.” 
  Cuomo noted he has coordinated with other governors from both parties to address the pandemic. “This is not about Democratic or Republican,” Cuomo said. “This is about New York -- 10,000 lives lost. ... Forget the darn politics.”

  New York governor Andrew Cuomo said Trump’s claim that he has “total” authoritiy to determine when the economy should reopen is “factually wrong.”  
  “That statement cannot stand,” Cuomo said when asked why he decided to push back against the president’s claim, which has been contradicted by constiutional experts. 
  Cuomo noted many other aspects of the Constitution can be debated based on varying interpretations. “This is not one of those things that is ambiguous,” Cuomo said of the power granted to state governments. 
  The governor warned Trump’s false claim strikes at the “very concept of democracy.”

 Cuomo: Trump is 'clearly spoiling for a fight' 
  
  New York governor Andrew Cuomo said Trump’s tweets this morning, including one that referenced the film Mutiny on the Bounty, show the president is “unhappy” with some Democratic governors. 
  “The president is clearly spoiling for a fight on this issue,” Cuomo said of Trump’s efforts to quickly reopen the US economy. 
  But Cuomo said he would not get bogged down in partisan bickering in the middle of a pandemic. “The president will have no fight with me,” Cuomo said. “I will not engage it.”

 Cuomo says Trump does not have 'total' authority to reopen economy 
  
  New York governor Andrew Cuomo said Trump does not have “total” authority to reopen the economy, as the persident claimed during his briefing yesterday. 
  “That is not an accurate statement, in my opinion,” Cuomo said of Trump’s claim, which has been contradicted by constitutional experts. 
  Cuomo pointed out that the Constitution lays out a system of federalism, balancing power between the federal and state governments. 
  “We don’t have a king in this country,” Cuomo said. “We didn’t want a king, so we have a Constitution.” 
  Cuomo said earlier today that he would not be pressured to reopen New York’s economy if he did not think it was safe.

 New York recorded 778 deaths yesterday, Cuomo says 
  
  Despite some encouraging signs that New York has reached the apex of its coronavirus crisis, governor Andrew Cuomo announced that 778 New Yorkers died of the virus yesterday. 
  The state’s total death toll has reached 10,834, far higher than that of any other US state. 
  Cuomo said the death toll, while devastating, is a “lagging indicator” of how the virus is spreading through the state. The rate of hosptializations is more reflective of new cases.  
  “We changed the curve,” Cuomo said of New Yorkers’ social distancing practices. “We are changing the curve every day.”

 Cuomo: 'We think we are at the apex' 
  
  New York saw a small decrease in its coronavirus hospitalizations yesterday, governor Andrew Cuomo announced at his daily briefing. 
  The governor said the state recorded a “small tick down” in hospitalizations, but the number was basically flat. 
  Cuomo said the change in hospitalizations was “statistically irrelevant, but better than being up.” 
  “We think we are at the apex,” Cuomo said, while noting that 1,600 new people came in to New York hospitals yesterday. The decrease is attributed to people recovering from coronavirus and being discharged.

  Trump’s reelection campaign dismissed Barack Obama’s anticipated endorsement of Joe Biden, which is expected to come later today. 
  “Barack Obama spent much of the last five years urging Joe Biden not to run for president out of fear that he would embarrass himself,” Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. “Biden is a bad candidate who will embarrass himself and his party. President Trump will destroy him.”  
  The New York Times reported in August that Obama had been initially skeptical of Biden’s plans to run, but the former president quickly came around to the idea and even offered some advice before Biden’s campaign launch last year: 
   
    Up until earlier this year [2019], he suggested Mr. Biden would be better off sticking with his vague promise, made during the audition for the vice presidency, that his short-lived 2008 presidential campaign would be his last. 
   That has changed: While initially skeptical of Mr. Biden’s decision to run, Mr. Obama, driven by affection and loyalty, has been more active in advising his campaign than previously known — going so far as to request a briefing from the campaign before his friend officially joined the fray, according to people close to both men.

  Trump compared the current tension between him and some Democratic governors to the movie “Mutiny on the Bounty” in a new tweet.

  “Tell the Democrat Governors that ‘Mutiny On The Bounty’ was one of my all time favorite movies. A good old fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the Captain,” Trump wrote. “Too easy!” 
  Trump’s movie reference seems odd, considering the film focuses on a cruel captain who is eventually ousted from command after torturing his crew and causing several deaths.

  Many commentators have said that Trump’s claim of having the ability to reopen the economy flies in the face of federalism and the specific powers granted to governors in times of public health emergencies.  
  Even some Republican lawmakers, including senator Marco Rubio, have specifically said since Trump’s press conference yesterday that decisions about when and how to reopen the economy should be left to the governors. 
   
   
    How &amp; when to modify physical distancing orders should &amp; will be made by Governors. Federal guidelines issued by ⁦@CDCgov⁩ &amp; ⁦@WhiteHouse⁩ will be very influential.

  Trump mocked Andrew Cuomo after the New York governor said he would not be forced to unsafely reopen the state’s economy. 
  “Cuomo’s been calling daily, even hourly, begging for everything, most of which should have been the state’s responsibility, such as new hospitals, beds, ventilators, etc,” Trump wrote in a tweet. “I got it all done for him, and everyone else, and now he seems to want Independence! That won’t happen!” 
  In reality, Cuomo has repeatedly asked for more coordination with the Trump administration to address the crisis, and his team has complained that the federal government was “absent” in the early response to the virus.

  “If he ordered me to reopen in a way that would endanger the public health of the people of my state, I wouldn’t do it,” Cuomo said.

  Barack Obama intends to endorse Joe Biden in a video statement to be released later today, the Guardian has confirmed with a source close to the former president.  
  The endorsement will clear the way for Obama, who remains incredibly popular among Democrats, to potentially act as a surrogate for Biden on the campaign trail.  
  In 2016, while he was still in office, Obama stumped for Hillary Clinton across several battleground states, drawing massive crowds. But the historic campaigning by a sitting president was ultimately not enough to secure a victory for Clinton.

  An endorsement from Barack Obama would cap Joe Biden’s stunning comeback in the Democratic presidential primary after the former vice president stumbled in the early contests. 
  Biden came in fourth in the Iowa caucuses and fifth in the New Hampshire primary before capturing second place in the Nevada caucuses. 
  By that point, Bernie Sanders had become the undisputed frontrunner in the race, and many Democrats were preparing for a likely Sanders nomination.  
  But Biden’s landslide victory in South Carolina, followed by a series of Super Tuesday wins a few days later, gave him the delegate lead and the momentum to capture the nomination.

  Trump lashed out against congressional Democrats after they pushed for more funding for hospitals and state and local governments in the next coronavirus relief bill. 
  “The Democrats don’t want to approve more money for our great workers under the incredibly successful ‘Paycheck’ plan,” Trump wrote in a tweet. “Replenish Account Now!” 
  Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell tried to pass a relief bill by unanimous consent last week, but Democratic senators objected on the grounds that the bill did not go far enough. 
  McConnell’s bill would have granted $250 billion in additional funding to the small business loan program created by the stimulus package, while Democrats also wanted $250 billion for hospitals and state and local governments. 
  The bill failed to advance because of the back-and-forth, and the two parties appear to be at a stalemate over the issue, as small businesses and state governments wait for more of the desperately needed funds.

  Nearly 4 in 10 registered US voters support delaying the November election until coronavirus is under control, according to a new poll. 
  The TargetSmart survey found that 68 percent of voters think the pandemic will have a big effect on turnout in November. That number includes 80% of Democrats, 66% of independents and 58% of Republicans. 
  The poll also shows that 39% of voters think the November election should be delayed, although a majority (53%) oppose that idea. 
  The date of the election is established by a set of federal laws, so Congress would have to pass a law to move the date, which seems unlikely considering the House is controlled by the Democrats. 
  Joe Biden, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, has said he is opposed to delaying the election. “[W]e cannot, we cannot delay or postpone a constitutionally required November election,” Biden said last week. 
  The former vice president has voiced support for expanding absentee voting options, which was also a popular idea among respondents in the TargetSmart poll. Nearly 8 in 10 registered voters said it’s important for state and local governments to provide alternatives to in-person voting.

  Priorities is spending nearly $2 million to air the ad in several states that Trump won in 2016, including Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. 
  “In this time of crisis, we need to listen to our medical professionals and ensure they have the resources they need to keep them safe while they keep us safe. Unfortunately, Donald Trump is more concerned with deflecting blame and protecting his own political standing than taking the necessary steps to protect our country,” Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities USA, told ABC News.

 California pastors sue over church service restrictions 
  
  Three pastors in California are suing state officials who have placed restrictions on people gathering at church services due to the coronavirus outbreak. 
  The lawsuit lodged in the US district court for the central district of California, alleges Californians have been denied their “fundamental rights” of freedom of religion, speech and assembly due to the restrictions, which are aimed at slowing the spread of Covid-19. 
  Dhillon Law Group, headed by California Republican party official Harmeet Dhillon, is behind the lawsuit, along with three pastors and a churchgoer. California governor Gavin Newsom, one of the targets of the lawsuit, issued a stay at home order on 19 March and closed non-essential businesses. 
  Despite this directive, some worshippers have continued to gather, including in Sacramento county where 71 people linked to a single church became infected with the coronavirus. 
  California isn’t the only state where there has been a backlash against shuttering churches in order to protect public health.  
  In Kentucky, Governor Andy Beshear said state officials would be recording the license plates of anyone gathering at Easter services or other gatherings and imposing a two-week quarantine. Rand Paul, a Republican senator from the state, said the governor needed to “take a step back”. 
  In Kansas, Governor Laura Kelly has been locked in a battle with Republican state lawmakers over limiting the size of church congregations. Kelly, a Democrat, issued an order limiting services to 10 people, a measure that was overturned by the Republican-controlled legislature. Kelly turned to the state’s supreme court, which backed her authority and reinstated the limit.

 Cuomo: Trump cannot order New York to re-open 
  
  More from CNN and more from a governor of a north-eastern state who does not think Donald Trump has the power to tell him what to do about when and how to re-open. It’s Andrew Cuomo of New York, brother of Covid-19 patient and CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, and he says: 
   
   If he ordered me to reopen in a way that would endanger the public health of the people of my state, I wouldn’t do it. 
   
  Again, because it’s worth repeating, here’s what Trump claimed at his White House briefing on Monday night: “When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total.” 
  Again, because it’s worth repeating, no, it isn’t. 
  Trump and Cuomo have been here before, too, about 
   
     six million years 
    two weeks ago, when Trump said he was thinking about placing New York and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut under quarantine and an incredulous Cuomo said no, that wasn’t going to happen and then Trump said no, he hadn’t ever thought of it at all. And so forth. 
  More from Cuomo, as it happens, from NBC’s Today Show: 
   
   I don’t know what the president is talking about, frankly. We have a constitution … We don’t have a king … the president doesn’t have total authority. 
   
  And on reopening correctly, which New York is seeking to do in concert with six other north-eastern states: “It has to be phased. It has to be balanced. It’s a public health strategy and an economic reactivation strategy. The key to me is testing. People have to know that they are safe and the testing actually works to make people feel safe, and we don’t have that capacity now … We have to develop that widespread testing capacity.”

  Raines was speaking on MSNBC – the liberal-skewing network which Trump likes to call MSDNC, in what passes for a joke from a notoriously humorless chap, being a pun on the initials of the Democratic National Committee – after it cut away from the briefing, the propreity of showing which is a whole other argument going on in US newsrooms including the Guardian’s right now. 
  Anyway. Raines: 
  “I think this is one of the astonishing acts of disinformation we’ve seen from a White House since the Vietnam era and the five o’clock follies* of the Lyndon Johnson administration. 
  “What we are seeing here, I think, is a kind of imploding presidency. And with an implosion, you have to have a black hole at the center. And I think what we have here is a black hole that consists of two elements: President Trump’s extremely fragile ego, and his distrust of government experts.” 
  Raines also said that the still-not-fired-for-undercutting-the-president-and-becoming-more-famous-and-trusted Dr Anthony Fauci and the other White House public health experts “remind me of nervous parents trying to cope with a three-year-old on a sugar high”. 
  Our Washington bureau chief David Smith had a similar thought, in a fine take on the briefing, which is here:

 Connecticut will not reopen before late May – governor 
  
  The governor of Connecticut, Ned Lamont, has told CNN he will not move to ease social restrictions in his state before 20 May. 
  Connecticut, inextricably tied to New York economically, much like New Jersey, is one of seven north-eastern states which on Monday announced a plan to co-ordinate their reopening from social-distancing protocols and other measures to stop the spread of Covid-19. By the Johns Hopkins figures it has more than 13,000 confirmed cases and 602 deaths. 
  Donald Trump is chafing at the bit, of course, eager to reopen the US economy as it takes a terrible pounding in his re-election year.

  In short, Axios this morning puts Joe Biden in the lead against Donald Trump six key states, firstly Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, three of the rust belt, usually blue states which Trump famously won from under Hillary Clinton’s nose in 2016. 
  But it also has Biden up in Florida, Arizona and North Carolina, sunnier places, usually Republican, which if picked up would allow the former vice-president some leeway in those first three, where Trump remains strong. 
  And here’s a new poll from Arizona: Biden 52%, Trump 43%.  
  There are of course caveats to every poll and OH Insights lists them here. 
  Either which way, Bernie Sanders’ endorsement of Biden yesterday has seemingly wrapped up the Democratic primary – some sort of House of Cards-esque Andrew Cuomo late move notwithstanding – and for now the question is will the 3 November election go ahead in its usual form or will the bizarre scenes in Wisconsin last week presage some move to making voting easier and safer? Not if Trump can help it, of course.

  Yesterday, Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York, told reporters “the worst is over”, if social distancing and other restrictions remain in place, and announced a partnership with six other north-eastern governors to work on reopening the regional economy. 
  Of course, Trump’s public utterances clashed somewhat with such a cautious approach.  
  On Twitter, the president claimed authority over the states about reopening plans. The experts dismissed that claim. 
  Then at a White House briefing marked by attacks on reporters and the playing of a propaganda film half-ripped from Fox News, Trump made a claim for the ages: 
   
   When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total.  
   
  Constitutional lawyers: Nope. 
  CNN, CBS reporter Paula Reid and most of the rest of the press corps: Incredulous. 
  Fox News? 
  Laura Ingraham: “I thoroughly enjoyed today’s coronavirus task force briefing. That was great. It was a tour de force!” 
  Sean Hannity, from whose show much of Trump’s propaganda film seemed to come, spoke to Texas governor Greg Abbott, who said: “I think most states can reopen even sooner than later. We don’t have to wait until 1 May.” 
  That’s the date by which Trump, the panjandrum of the White House podium, has said he would like to start reopening the shuttered US economy. 
  White House experts including the notably not-yet-fired Dr Anthony Fauci have cast doubt on that goal and said moving too swiftly to lift social restrictions could cause a resurgence in Covid-19 cases. Trump says the decision is his alone and he will listen to his advisers – and also rely a lot on “instinct”. 
  Let that sink in. While you do, here’s some reading:

24,health,Bolsonaro fires popular health minister after dispute over coronavirus response,"Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro has sparked protests and anger by sacking his popular health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, after the two clashed over Bolsonaro’s highly controversial response to the coronavirus pandemic.   Related: Bolsonaro threatens to sack health minister over coronavirus criticism    “I have just received notice of my dismissal from President Jair Bolsonaro,” Mandetta tweeted on Thursday. “I would like to say thank you for the opportunity that was given to me, to manage our health service … and to plan our fight against the coronavirus epidemic, this great challenge that our health system is about to face.” Speaking shortly after Mandetta’s exit was announced, Bolsonaro claimed the separation had been “a consensual divorce” – but signaled dissatisfaction with his former minister’s position on the economic impact of coronavirus. “I know … life is priceless. But the economy and jobs must return to normal,” Bolsonaro said, as he introduced his new health minister, Nelson Teich, an oncologist who was CEO of a group of private clinics and is now a partner in a medical service consulting outfit. Mandetta’s sacking has been anticipated for weeks, as Bolsonaro repeatedly downplayed coronavirus and urged the relaxation of social distancing measures while Mandetta defended such policies. But the move to force out Brazil’s most senior health official came just weeks before the virus is expected to reach its peak in the country. Confirmed cases have soared to more than 30,425 and 1,924 Brazilians have died. When news of the sacking broke, shouts of “Bolsonaro murderer!” were heard in central Rio de Janeiro and pan-bashing protests erupted in cities across the country. “It absurd to change the health minister in the middle of a pandemic,” said one Rio de Janeiro intensive care doctor, speaking anonymously for fear of repercussions. “It was a terrible decision by the president, a president imprisoned in empirical ideas without any scientific or clinical basis, who is going against everything that is happening in the world.” Bolsonaro’s public call for Brazil to get back to work and his efforts to undermine regional governments’ shutdowns have appalled critics and sparked a political rebellion by the governors of nearly all of Brazil’s 27 states. In contrast, during calm daily briefings Mandetta advised Brazilians to follow state governments’ advice on isolation.     The new Brazilian minister of health, Nelson Teich. Photograph: Joédson Alves/EPA    “Don’t think that we are going to escape a sharp rise in cases of this illness,” he said in his final briefing on Thursday. “The health system still isn’t ready [to deal with] a rapid increase [in cases].” Writing ahead of Bolsonaro’s decision, the political commentator Leandro Colon said Mandetta’s sacking might be good news “for those rooting for Jair Bolsonaro’s quick downfall”. Such a move would further isolate the rightwing populist and could provoke “a political reaction of major proportions”, Colon wrote in the Folha de São Paulo newspaper. But Colon warned that Mandetta’s removal would also be bad news for the health of Brazil’s 211 million citizens. Recent modelling by researchers from Imperial College London suggested Brazil could have more than 1.1 million Covid-19 deaths if no action were taken to control the pandemic; 529,000 if only elderly people were forced to isolate; and 44,200 if drastic measures were implemented.   Related: 'We're abandoned to our own fate': coronavirus menaces Brazil's favelas    Speaking after Mandetta’s firing, Bolsonaro painted himself as a protector of the poor. “We cannot harm the neediest – they have no way of staying at home for very long without going out to seek their sustenance,” he said. In his farewell press conference, Mandetta urged his former staff to mount an “unyielding defense of life and science” – a clear swipe at his former boss. “Don’t be afraid,” he said. “Science is light … and it is through science that we will find a way out of this.” His successor, Teich, said Brazil needed a full testing programme to better understand the new coronavirus and promised no “abrupt decision” on social distancing. But he also made it clear Brazil would slowly start reopening. “What we are really doing here today is working for society to return to normal as quickly as possible,” he said."
25,health,Local health services lack the tools for this crisis,"Anthony Costello (The UK’s Covid-19 strategy dangerously leaves too many questions unanswered, theguardian.com, 15 March) argues for the importance of a public health response to Covid-19, including testing, tracing and quarantining. In Britain, how would this be managed locally? Before 2012, the responsibility for local public health within the NHS was held by primary care trusts (PCTs) and, before those, by local health authorities. In each case, they worked alongside local government, environmental and other key public health-critical services. In 2012 the Health and Social Care Act (the “Lansley reforms”) abolished PCTs and shifted local NHS public health responsibility to local government. Simultaneously, after 2010, the local government financial base was largely destroyed, stripping out swathes of supported local networks and infrastructural services, and wrecking social care. Community health services have struggled since, and while many efforts are being made by GP commissioning groups and trusts to reintegrate services locally, these efforts struggle to overcome the impediments to integration put in place by the Lansley reforms. Where does this leave the public health response to what Boris Johnson describes as our “worst public health crisis for a generation” (Report, 13 March)? Who is in charge locally, and what networks can they call upon? Is the extent to which the UK is clearly out-of-step with more active measures being taken across Europe an implicit recognition that we now lack local public health leadership with the right tools and infrastructure? Public health emergencies are always, in the event, managed locally. Everyone in the public services will do their best, but are they battling institutional fragmentation in public health, as well as Covid-19?Maureen Mackintosh Professor of economics, The Open University, Pam Smith Professorial fellow, nursing studies, University of Edinburgh, Dr Bridget Towers Historian of international public health, Dr Richard Williams General medical practitioner (retired), Dr Moira Dick Consultant community paediatrician (retired), David Wield Professor of innovation and development, The Open University • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

26,health,"Declare abortion a public health issue during pandemic, WHO urged","The World Health Organization is being urged to declare abortion an essential health service during the coronavirus pandemic. In guidance notes issued last week, the WHO advised all governments to identify and prioritise the health services each believed essential, listing reproductive health services as an example. Clinical guidelines published by the organisation last month said that women’s right to sexual and reproductive healthcare “should be respected irrespective of Covid-19 status, including access to contraception and safe abortion”. Simon Cooke, the CEO of Marie Stopes International (MSI), said a stronger pronouncement by the WHO would be “immensely helpful as it would help countries to see abortion from a public health perspective”. There have been growing calls for governments to protect abortion services during the crisis. On Wednesday, 100 NGOs issued a joint statement imploring European states to find new ways to help women access services during lockdown, such as through online consultations and, as introduced in the UK introduced last month, by allowing them to take abortion pills at home. In the US, the Center for Reproductive Rights has filed emergency lawsuits in five states to thwart moves by legislators to ban abortion during the pandemic.       “For us and for women who have unplanned pregnancies, it’s a very worrying time and [abortion] is time critical,” said Cooke. Last week, MSI warned that up 9.5 million women and girls would not access family planning services this year because of the pandemic, which could result in as many as 3m unintended pregnancies and 2.7m unsafe abortions. “It’s clear the majority of abortions are done in the first trimester, which makes them extremely safe. As countries go into lockdown or mobility is reduced, women will have to wait longer and the procedure becomes more complex,” said Cooke. “In the UK that’s one thing, where we have the infrastructure to deal with late terminations, but in many countries we operate in that’s not an option. Therefore it becomes critical and there’s a risk of unsafe abortion and complications.” He said abortion was “absolutely essential” to save lives. Unsafe abortionsaccount for between 4% and 13% of maternal deaths. Dr Jeanne Conry, president elect of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, said  “Abortion access is critical. Women need access or we will see more unintended pregnancies, more maternal mortality and more unsafe abortion,” said Conry. “Abortion is not an elective procedure, it’s an essential part of women’s healthcare. It’s absolutely time dependent.” She said telemedicine, where women can speak to doctors over the internet, was “critical right now” .   Related: Coronavirus crisis may deny 9.5 million women access to family planning    On Thursday, the International Planned Parenthood Federation said 23 of its member associations have had to reduce their abortion services because of Covid-19, with 5,600 clinics across 64 countries already closed. There were also reports of shortages of contraceptives and HIV medicines. “These figures show that millions of women and girls across the world now face an even greater challenge in trying to take care of their own health and bodies,” said the IPPF’s director general, Dr Alvaro Bermejo."
27,health,Let those over 70 make their own health choices,"If the government’s objective is to prevent the spread of coronavirus, keeping elderly people at home will not be effective, but it will stop some premature deaths (Over-70s: Advice to stay at home will soon be issued, 16 March). If the objective is to forcibly stop people from risking premature death, then the government should ban alcohol, dangerous sports, and overweight people taking stressful jobs. If the objective is to stop the spread of the virus, then everybody without a business or health reason to travel should be advised to stay at home, whatever their age. People have a right to make their own health choices as long as it does not affect others. Locking up one set of the population, who are possibly the least likely to travel, is a pointless publicity exercise.Dr Wyn JenkinsFlint, Flintshire  • The stigma attached to old age (feebleness, incapacity, frailty, dependency) has long been condemned by older people themselves, as well as social gerontologists and policymakers, who have made every effort to demonstrate that the category “the elderly” is as varied as every other generational category below it. In one fell swoop the government has now undermined those efforts. Surely it is those of any age exhibiting evidence-based, “at risk” characteristics who should qualify for seclusion, rather than everybody falling into a particular age group. Perhaps the House of Lords could vote on it?Gillian DalleyLondon • What Matt Hancock is actually saying to the over-70s is that the Conservative government has reduced the number of hospital beds by 17,000 and starved the NHS of funds, and as you are no longer of any value to society you should isolate yourselves for four months. If, due to your own selfishness, you fail to follow this directive and catch Covid-19 then you must suffer the consequences because ventilators will not be available for you.Tony SpratleyNewark, Nottinghamshire • If you’ve been exposed to Covid-19 or have possible symptoms, you may be asked to self-isolate. If you’re over 70, even without symptoms or known exposure, you may be asked to self-isolate. The health secretary appears to use the same term for both. Can we ditch this confusing expression and call a spade a spade? The former lasts about two weeks and is more usually known as quarantine. It may be boring and inconvenient. The latter could last up to four months. It may be as lethal to the physical and mental health of older people as Covid-19 itself. If enforceable, house arrest would be a suitable term. I won’t be the only person over 70 taking my usual walk in the park and risking actual arrest.Christine CockshottBroughton-in-Furness, Cumbria • If all over-70s are to be quarantined for up to four months, could we please have one day when we are allowed out and everyone else has to stay in? This would give us a fighting chance of avoiding contagion after such draconian efforts. That way we could enjoy a sense of freedom since any social contact would, in theory, be virus free. Presumably, the strategy is to keep all us older folk out of the hospitals to free up capacity for the infected younger ones. Not a bad idea, but who will be looking after the children and dogs?Christine WeaserSevenoaks, Kent • Just as we are about to stigmatise and isolate people over 70, the Americans are about to re-elect one, or replace him with someone even older, as the leader of the free world. I’ll be turning 70 in the arbitrary four-month period that has been mooted, so I guess I am a free man until late June, and then turn into a far more contagious and/or vulnerable pariah overnight. It’s the sure route to “Papieren, bitte”. Just two of the contradictory insanities that this virus has led to. “Those whom the gods would destroy they first make mad”.

28,health,Which family member gets health coverage? Let's pull straws,"When the session was over, our new therapist tried to scan her Venmo code, but there was a glitch with my bank account attached to our Venmo. Even though I knew, because I’d checked before we came, that the $305 this session cost was in our account, I started to sweat. She is only doing her job, I told myself, having been a person who charges hourly rates and had to collect them. Then the payment, for whatever reason, finally was able to go through. She’s worth every penny, I reminded myself, as my daughter and I gathered up our shoes and coats in the light-filled waiting room, complete with a wooden dollhouse. Two years ago, through a program that our daughter’s pre-K teacher recommended, we agreed to be a part of a city-wide study that granted our daughter a course of tests over a period of months at no cost. (This kind of testing would usually cost about $2,500). We got a diagnosis of ADHD for our now seven-year-old. None of the other psychiatrists we needed to continue helping our daughter takes insurance, said the doctor who gave us the diagnosis. The doctor she recommended most strongly, and, how could I help myself, the one I immediately felt we needed to see, cost $395 an hour.   box   We can’t afford it, said my husband. We don’t have a choice, I said. We sat with the doctor for an hour and in the end he offered to write our daughter a prescription but with no follow-up or regular therapy. I said that we weren’t ready. She was only five then. He offered to talk again to us on the phone, still $395 an hour, but we only ended up speaking for 20 minutes that second time. We decided to hold off on the meds. What do we do, though? I asked my husband when she was on the floor throwing a tantrum, when we were out in public and we knew her lack of bodily control was not her fault, when I was reading five different books on the topic only to be left more confused by the disparate opinions I read. We just keep helping her, he said.   line break   When we got home from the new therapist a few weeks ago, our daughter kept asking to go back. It will work, she told me, right before bedtime. Her sister asked if she could go also. It’s for kids who are older, I told her. Is it because she doesn’t listen? asked our younger daughter, then proceeded to not listen to anything I said the rest of the night. It’s expensive, I said. I have money saved, our seven-year-old said. In the waiting room of our new therapist are shelves of expensive toys that I recognize from the toy store we only ever walked by in our old neighborhood in Brooklyn. There is a large mirror and lots of tools allowing our daughter to use her body in ways that helped her to focus in the room we were counseled in. Intuitively, instinctually, it feels like a space where my daughter will flourish. Is it just because of how beautiful it is? Is it because capitalism has taught me to believe that beautiful spaces are better than spaces that are not beautiful? Is it because I want to be the sort of parent who can give her child beautiful things?   Related: A dirty secret: you can only be a writer if you can afford it    The therapist is careful and thoughtful. On the wall, in the waiting room, are her degrees, all from fancy places. She is worth the money, is what I’m trying to say. Of all the things in the world for which a person might pay $305 there are few things I was more willing to pay for than this. When I was a private SAT tutor, an hour with me cost more than an hour with this therapist. But the SAT, then, to me, felt like a higher-order concern. Whereas this help for our seven-year-old – who feels less overwhelmed now by being asked to pay attention in class or to not come into our room at night because her brain was whirring and telling me she was worried that no one understood that she didn’t listen when people told her things – feels entirely necessary. The friend who recommended this therapist said her family had 70% covered by their insurance through her husband’s job, which I knew was better than ours. Our insurance – which is through Child Health Plus, a nationwide program controlled by the states that subsidizes healthcare for children who don’t qualify for Medicaid but whose families can’t afford or don’t have access to private insurance – can pay for care on a sliding scale. It’s great in some ways. It’s great if you don’t leave the state, for instance; elsewhere, almost none of the care you seek is covered. It’s great, it turns out, as long as you don’t seek mental healthcare, which is, according to the website and three different conversations that I had with representatives, not covered at all. This story doesn’t end with total despair and it also doesn’t end in victory. I’m still investigating other insurance options for our children. The therapist has an associate she’s offered to transfer our daughter to who charges less. This is, for now, a story about the way the systems under which we live force us to make choices that might at first feel impossible, about trading and compromising amid what used to feel like necessities. In the meantime, what we’re doing is no longer paying for the private health insurance my husband and I used to be covered by. We were paying $1,430 a month for healthcare – well over 10% of our combined yearly income – with a $7,500 deductible. We’ve only used it a handful of times. We’ve often had to cut this cost before. The choice in this way feels almost uncomplicated: our baby’s struggling and we believe this therapist can help her. Whatever happens to my husband and I in the meantime, nothing feels as dire as addressing that."
29,health,Australia's private health funds could reap windfall from coronavirus – report,"Private health insurance funds stand to reap a windfall of between $3.5bn and $5.5bn due to a dramatic fall in elective surgery and other medical procedures during the coronavirus crisis, according to new research from the Australia Institute thinktank. Health expert Roy Harvey said if the funds failed to pass on the dramatic fall in costs to customers, more people will flee a private health insurance system that is already in a death spiral. Harvey, who worked with Australia Institute research director Rod Campbell on the report, said that if premiums were cut in line with services the federal government would also save $1bn to $1.5bn a year in subsidies.   Related: 'Like preparing for war': Australia's hospitals brace for coronavirus peak    The Australia Institute paper, “Private eyes ..., hips, etc”, models the effect on the funds if benefits paid to members drop by between 30% and 50% during a six-month period. Factors taken into account include health minister Greg Hunt’s decision last week to pay at least $1.3bn to private hospitals to take over beds potentially needed to accommodate Covid-19 victims, and sweeping bans on dental services introduced by dentists. Harvey said that many funds have abandoned premium hikes that were planned for this month, but this was not enough. “They’ve been saying we won’t put through the 4% increase that they’re allowed to do in April, but if they say, ‘Oh, we’ll give you a 40% discount’, people might stay. “If they keep their rates unchanged, people will leave in droves.” The coronavirus pandemic has hit a private health industry that experts say was already in a “death spiral” because young people, who get relatively little from the product, have quit paying premiums. This has left the funds with a membership increasingly weighted towards older people, who typically require more expensive medical procedures. The escalating financial instability of the industry led the regulator to warn in February that only three will be viable in two years unless urgent action is taken. “It sounds as if you’re not talking about a viable system or a product people want to buy,” Harvey said. “The thing is unsustainable, it’s undermining the public hospital principle of equity and allowing doctors to charge fees that take people out of the public hospitals.” He said it was hard to estimate the impact of the pandemic on private health using publicly available figures, but the $3.5bn to $5.5bn range was a good starting point. “I think any detailed study would come up with figures that are in the range,” he said. “Other people can say, ‘Oh, I think it’s this or that’, but it’s really to get a discussion started. “The Productivity Commission could sort this out in less than a week in terms of getting good estimates.” He said the funds should be held accountable for their windfall and money saved by the government could be used to fund other things, such as domestic violence services, that are needed during the pandemic. “The savings to the commonwealth alone could be one to one and a half billion [dollars] – one and a half billion used to be a lot of money once,” he said. Campbell said the insurers looked set to trouser their windfall billions. “Insurers claim to be supporting their members through the crisis by delaying premium increases, but they should be passing on these significant savings to households,” he said. “If the commonwealth does not ensure savings are passed on to customers, it will be one of the most egregious subsidies ever given to an industry already infamous for receiving handouts.”"
30,health,Experts warn of mental health fallout from mass US unemployment,"The US faces a catastrophic rise in unemployment following the forced shutdown of businesses across the country to stop the spread of Covid-19 – and experts are warning it could trigger a severe mental health crisis. In just two weeks, more than 9.95 million Americans have applied for unemployment – smashing all records. Economists are predicting the unemployment rate could rise as high as 30% as the pandemic sweeps across the country.   Related: Coronavirus batters US economy as 6.65m file for unemployment last week    Those hardest hit are likely to be the poorest, including many people of color, and those who benefited least from the last economic boom. “With a 30% national unemployment rate, the impact will be devastating for everyone. But it will be particularly crushing for black Americans,” said William Darity, a professor of economics at Duke University and co-author of a study that found black Americans with no history of mental health diagnoses were more likely to have depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder during the 2007-09 Great Recession. To mitigate the effects of the massive wave of unemployment, Congress has passed a $2.2tn stimulus package to help everyday Americans. The bill includes a payment of up to $1,200 to most taxpayers and $250bn to buffer unemployment insurance – an additional $600 to those who qualify for unemployment for up to 12 weeks. But beyond the dollar signs, economists are worried about the long-term effects that being unemployed will have on Americans’ mental health – a problem that will further highlight the cracks in the country’s safety net and healthcare system. It may seem cliche but work is not all about the money, and research proves it. “People want to work. They want to do meaningful things,” said Art Goldsmith, a professor of economics at Washington and Lee University who has researched the psychological effects of unemployment. Although Goldsmith noted there is evidence that people experience a brief period of optimism when they are first let go from their jobs – they find they have more time to do other tasks, like cleaning out a garage – dangerous feelings of pessimism can set in after four to five weeks of unemployment. “As the weeks go on, and we see the economy struggling, I think there will be more pessimism. I worry the emotional footprint of this experience can be quite large,” Goldsmith said. ﻿A $1,200 check from the government and stronger unemployment insurance benefits will help Americans in the short term to pay their bills and other essentials but it cannot replace the value of having a job.   Related: What US unemployment benefits can I get during the coronavirus? Your payment options explained    “People who have meaning and purpose in their work have much, much higher levels of wellbeing than other people,” said Carol Graham, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a professor at the University of Maryland. “People will trade off money for doing work they care about and doing work where they have respect and autonomy.” The effects of unemployment on mental health are long-lasting. An Association for Psychological Science study published in September 2019 found that those who experienced financial, housing or job-related hardship during the Great Recession were more likely to have depression, anxiety or substance abuse as many as three years after the recession. A poll from Gallup conducted in 2014 found that unemployed Americans were more than twice as likely to self-report being treated for depression. Economists are particularly concerned about people who were disenfranchised before the crisis started. Black Americans historically have an unemployment rate that is twice as high as the overall rate, even in a healthy economy. ﻿The overall median wealth for a black family is 10 times less than the median wealth of a white family. Discriminatory job processes have kept black Americans in low-paying jobs, many of which have seen layoffs with Covid-19. “From the standpoint of providing for oneself and one’s family, the situation is already significantly less secure for black Americans.” While the mental health toll from unemployment is shared across the globe, America’s weak safety net and lack of affordable healthcare exacerbates the consequences for unemployed Americans. Economists have shown that unemployment and low wages have literally fatal consequences for Americans. In 2015 Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton, winner of the 2015 Nobel prize for economics, found middle-aged white Americans were more likely to die in mid-life than their parents – reversing decades of steadily increasing life expectancy. They coined the term “deaths of despair” and blamed the rise on suicide, drug overdose or alcohol-related liver disease. Their research found geographic and class-related underpinnings to the rise: places that have a smaller fraction of working-age people in jobs are more likely to have higher rates of deaths of despair. The people dying were overwhelmingly white working-age Americans without college degrees. That group of people were finding that their jobs were being valued less than previous generations by the American economy – they were working for lower wages, inflexible hours and fewer benefits. Many lost jobs to changing technology. Exacerbating the problem has been easy access to addictive opioids and firearms (more than half of suicides in America are committed with a firearm). “We all but load the weapons of self-destruction for people in misery,” noted surgeon Atul Gawande in the New Yorker. This economic and mental health crisis will only be deepened by the sudden rise in unemployment. And, in the meantime, many Americans face barriers to getting mental healthcare. While health insurance can offset the cost of therapy and access to a psychiatrist, Americans typically rely on an employer for health insurance and lose access if they are laid off. About 28 million Americans do not have health insurance at all. ﻿Cities typically do not rely on a single firm to keep people employed. If a major company shuts down, people can typically find employment elsewhere. But with huge sectors of the service industry – restaurants, hair salons, hotels – shutting down amid the pandemic, the mental health toll of this recession is likely to cast a wide net. “What’s going to happen to low-skilled, support sectors in the cities if this lasts really long? We’d have whole different population cohorts we haven’t seen before that may also suffer some severe mental health crises,” Graham said. “I’m not saying we shouldn’t social-distance – we have no choice. But we really need to think about the mental health part of this crisis as much as the economic one.” In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. Other international suicide helplines can be found at befrienders.org"
31,health,"Health inequality greater than previously thought, report finds","Women are living nearly ten years longer in poor health than previous estimates, while men are living an extra seven years, according to a report based on new NHS data launched by the health secretary on Wednesday. The new analysis means that men on average are being diagnosed with their first significant long-term condition at 56 and women at 55. In the poorest areas, women are getting their first significant long-term illness at just 47 and men at 49 years old. The report, The Health of the Nation: A Strategy for Healthier Longer Lives, has been written by the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Longevity. It found that women in the UK are living for 29 years in poor health and men for 23 years: an increase of 50% for women and 42% for men on previous estimates based on self-reported data. “A key reason for low productivity in the north is that health is worse and reducing this gap would therefore generate substantial gross value added, estimated at an additional £13.2bn,” it concluded. Lord Geoffrey Filkin, joint APPG lead and co-author of the report, said the report contained important messages for the new prime minister’s promise to ‘level up’ the country. “Boris Johnson’s majority at the election was built on seats in areas with low healthy life expectancies,” he said. “But high levels of chronic illness in the north contribute to its lower levels of employment. Poor health causes people to drop out of work: men aged 55 to 65 are less likely to be in employment now than in the 1970s.” Tina Woods, joint APPG lead and co-author of the report, said: “If the number of working age people with limiting long-term health conditions were reduced by 10%, it would increase the economic activity rate by 3% in the ‘northern powerhouse’. “Good jobs for local people contribute to better health. Improvements in health and health inequalities are necessary to unleash the potential of the whole country.” The APPG for Longevity has spent nine months working with a range of cross-party politicians, the government’s Behavioural Insight Team and Public Health England, as well as experts including the King’s Fund and the Health Foundation on how to improve the nation’s health. Their report found that the number of major illnesses suffered by older people will increase by 85% between 2015 and 2035. It also found older people in the poorest areas have 35% more spent on them by the NHS than older people in the richest areas. But the report also found that up to 75% of new cases of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, 40% of cancer incidence and dementia risks could be reduced if we cut smoking, unhealthy diet, harmful consumption of alcohol and insufficient physical activity. “This report describes both a shocking current picture – and an optimistic future one,” said Damian Green, MP and chair of the APPG for Longevity. “What is shocking is that far too many citizens get prematurely ill with illnesses that could have been avoided. Premature avoidable ill-health is rampant, and it is bad for individuals, our society and our economy. “The optimistic point is that we can change this,” he added. “But it will require action by charities, local authorities, business, academia, central government and by citizens themselves.” The report found that as our population ages there will be very large increases in the number of cases of ill-health over the next 15 years. In 2035 there will be around 16 million cases of dementia, arthritis, type 2 diabetes and cancers in people aged 65 and over – twice as many as in 2015. In ten years, there will be 5.5 million people with type 2 diabetes while 70% of people aged 55+ will have at least one obesity-related disease."
32,health,"'Thirdhand' smoke a health risk in cinemas, say researchers","The lights dim, the trailers roll and the mutter of voices dwindles to a hush. But alongside the smell of popcorn, another scent pervades the cinema: the waft of stale cigarette smoke. Now scientists say they have measured levels of such “thirdhand” smoke, suggesting it is carried on the bodies and clothing of moviegoers and could be a prominent, and lingering, source of hazardous chemicals. “This represents significant but poorly understood health risks to non-smokers and a source of reactive chemicals indoors,” said Dr Drew Gentner, co-author of the research from Yale University, noting that previous studies suggest thirdhand smoke may account for between 5% and 60% of the combined disease burden from cigarette smoke in non-smokers. Writing in the journal Science Advances, researchers report how they tracked traces of cigarette smoke in a German cinema – a venue where smoking is not permitted. The cinema was 1,300 sq metres in size, and supplied with fresh, filtered air from outside. The team sampled the exhaust air duct of the cinema for four days and detected 35 volatile substances that are found in tobacco smoke, including formaldehyde and the carcinogenic chemical benzene. Concentrations of such substances showed a spike when customers entered the screening. Less pronounced spikes were seen for earlier showtimes, while levels of the substances were lower for family films than for “R-rated” action films aimed at older cinemagoers, despite the latter having smaller audiences. “In the R-rated films, especially the ones that are occurring later in the evening, it appears there’s a greater propensity of people attending those movies to have smoked, or perhaps to have smoked more frequently or more cigarettes, and so they are off-gassing more,” said Gentner. Analysis of particular substances revealed that, in the case of the action films, the thirdhand smoke was relatively “fresh”, while its presence in family films was older – possibly down to substances lingering from previous screenings. The team found signs that substances from thirdhand smoke build up over time. “That’s because the chemicals don’t remain entirely in the air, but are also absorbed on to various surfaces and furnishings from which they re-enter the air over time,” said Gentner. The researchers also collected samples of fine, airborne particles from the cinema and analysed the substances stuck to them. Among those detected was nicotine. The team said the upshot was that those going to R-rated films were exposed, on average, to the equivalent of secondhand smoke from between one and 10 cigarettes, depending on the substance in question. The study involved audiences of different sizes, and it was not clear which moviegoers had previously been smoking or exposed to smoke. The team did not look at how exposure to thirdhand smoke varied with proximity to a source. “The people in the room will all be exposed to the same number of secondhand smoke equivalents in terms of emissions, but the total mass of the compounds they inhale will change with their proximity to the source,” said Gentner. The team say the study offers a real-life example of exposure, adding that other spaces, which may be smaller with poorer ventilation – such as bars, offices and underground trains – could have much higher levels of thirdhand smoke. Prof John Britton, director of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies and consultant in respiratory medicine at Nottingham University, said the results were not surprising. “This study confirms what anyone with a sense of smell has already worked out: that smokers carry and emit tobacco smoke components into the atmosphere even when not smoking,” he said. “In reality the exposure sustained by others in such circumstances is low, and any health risk likely to be likewise,” he added, although he called for more research into potential impacts. Others said it was not clear whether the levels of thirdhand smoke detected were high enough to cause health problems. “It is a long road … to showing that there is anything that non-smokers should be concerned about,” said Martin Jarvis, emeritus professor of health psychology at University College London, who was not involved in the research. Prof Jacqui Hamilton, an expert in aerosol chemistry and air quality from York University noted that, while the detected emissions included hazardous chemicals such as benzene and formaldehyde, some of the most toxic compounds within thirdhand smoke – tobacco-specific nitrosamines – were not detected, although it was not clear why.  “Only very small levels of exposure to these compounds have the potential to increase cancer risk and future studies could investigate this to understand the full impact of tobacco-related emissions on non-smokers,” Hamilton said."
33,health,China's Sars-like illness worries health experts,"The finding that the outbreak of viral pneumonia in China that has struck 59 people may be caused by a coronavirus, the family of viruses behind Sars, which spread to 37 countries in 2003, causing global panic and killing more than 750 people, means that health authorities will be watching closely. China says the illness is not Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), nor Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome), both of which are caused by coronaviruses, and so far it appears milder than both. Unlike Sars, it does not appear to spread easily between humans and unlike Mers, which has a mortality rate of about 35%, nobody has died.   Related: Experts warn world ‘grossly unprepared’ for future pandemics    But the identification in preliminary laboratory tests by the Chinese of a novel coronavirus emerging once more from animals to infect humans is worrying for global health experts. When Sars appeared in China in 2002, it was not swiftly identified and contained. It spread around the world – particularly to Canada – via travellers. Jeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome and an expert in tropical diseases, said: “Epidemics of diseases known and unknown are one of our greatest global health threats – threats that are with us constantly. “A cluster of patients with an unusual respiratory infection is, and should always be, a worry. The level of concern raises again when the illness is linked to an animal food source. This is how new viruses jump across the species barrier – as was the case with Sars, Mers, avian flu and Ebola.” The source of the virus is not yet known but investigations have centred on a market in Wuhan selling live animals and seafood. The origin of Sars was eventually traced to bats in a cave in Yunnan province in China. Dromedary camels are the source of Mers, although it is thought they may also have originally been infected by bats. The World Health Organization said in a statement that the Chinese authorities believed the disease “does not transmit readily between people”, but that it could cause severe illness in some patients. Seven people were known to be critically ill at the weekend. The Chinese authorities have not updated the figures since Sunday. State television said eight people taken to hospital with respiratory problems had been sent home. “More comprehensive information is required to confirm the pathogen, as well as to better understand the epidemiology of the outbreak, the clinical picture, the investigations to determine the source, modes of transmission, extent of infection and the countermeasures implemented,” the WHO said. The memory of Sars has already triggered precautionary behaviour in Hong Kong, where people arriving from Wuhan are being screened for the flu-like symptoms of respiratory disease. Some people have been hospitalised, but none has proved to have viral pneumonia of the type found in China. Farrar said one of the key concerns was whether the infection was passing from one person to another. “Are doctors and nurses treating patients, or family members, who have not had the same exposure to the source, also getting sick?” he asked. “If the infection is not passing person to person, then the level of concern is somewhat reduced – although it can always happen later and infections can change.” It appeared that there had not been any newly confirmed cases in Wuhan for about a fortnight, he said, which was reassuring. “The health authorities in China are right, therefore, to take the time necessary to carry out thorough tests and to ensure correct diagnosis. When public health responses are rushed, problems follow – as we saw with early responses to the Nipah outbreak in 1999,” he said. “While early identification of this new virus is testimony to vastly improved monitoring, the global health community still has much to do to address global epidemic preparedness. We are still without a vaccine or treatment for Sars or Mers, which we have long known to be epidemic threats.”"
34,health,"Coronavirus: containment is now 'unlikely', says NSW health minister","Authorities in New South Wales are searching for 70 doctors who attended a radiology conference with two people affected by Covid-19 and assessing more than a dozen children who visited a Sydney nursing home where four people have been diagnosed with the virus. “I think at this point it is fair to say that we do have an evolution happening in the spread of this virus,” New South Wales health minister Brad Hazzard said.   Related: Coronavirus latest updates: Australia warns its 'worst-case' scenario is millions infected over several weeks    “We do know that containment is likely to be an unlikely outcome, so we need to work constructively with the community to continue our effort to emphasise to the community that [controlling the virus] is a partnership … Our community has to be doing everything they can do to support us in defeating what has really become a war in defeating this coronavirus.” Four people at the Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care facility in northern Sydney – a 95-year-old woman who has since died, a 82-year-old man, a 70-year-old man and an aged care worker in her 50s – have so far tested positive to Covid-19. The 70-year-old man resided in a different area of the lodge and was cared for by different staff than the other affected residents, which Hazzard said suggested infection control protocols had not contained the spread. The aged care centre has since been isolated. NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said about 17 children from the Banksia Cottage childcare centre at Macquarie University visited the aged care home on 24 February, on a day when the infected aged care worker was not working. Health authorities are meeting with parents and children on Thursday night to conduct assessments. Hazzard said that as a precaution, childcare centres had been advised to suspend their regular visits to aged care homes until the risk of children being “super-spreaders” of the disease had been determined. He said that authorities had contacted 77 doctors who attended a radiology seminar on 18 February, which is being investigated as the possible source of infection for a 53-year-old doctor at Ryde hospital who tested positive to the virus this week. Another doctor at that seminar, a registrar in her 30s from Liverpool hospital, was diagnosed with Covid-19 this week. Neither doctor had travelled overseas or had contact with known coronavirus patients. Hazzard said the process of tracing back possible contact between infected people was “a bit like a police investigation in a sense, trying to track who is coming into contact with who and what possible associations there may have been”. Meanwhile, a tourist in Darwin in Australia’s Northern Territory has tested positive for coronavirus. It is the first confirmed case in the territory, which contains hundreds of remote communities. On Thursday NT Health said a 52-year-old man carrying the virus was in isolation in Royal Darwin hospital. The man recently arrived in Darwin from Sydney and has had limited contact with the local community, NT Health said. The department was undertaking contact tracing and would reach out to those who may have been in contact with the man.   Related: Coronavirus: student accommodation at Sydney University turned into isolation centre    New South Wales confirmed overnight that the virus had spread to six new people in the state, bringing the number of cases to 22. The death of the woman in aged care is Australia’s second recorded coronavirus death, after a 78-year-old who had been evacuated from the Diamond Princess died in hospital in Perth. There have now been 52 confirmed cases of the virus in Australia since the outbreak began. The virus continues to spread in NSW, where the majority of cases have been confirmed.  On Thursday prime minister Scott Morrison announced upgraded travel advice for South Korea, recommending people reconsider travel. Travel bans remain in place for China and Iran and citizens and permanent residents returning from those countries are required to self-isolate for 14 days. Besides the aged-care resident, health authorities said a female doctor at Liverpool hospital, a woman in her 30s from the northern beaches, a male from Cronulla in his 50s and a woman in her 60s who is believed to have returned from the Philippines had all tested positive. “The female doctor who was diagnosed on March 4 had no history of overseas travel,” Chant said. “We are immediately establishing which staff and patients may need to self-isolate and be tested for Covid-19 should they be unwell.” The woman in her 60s arrived back in Australia on 3 March and is believed to have returned from the Philippines. “Her travel details are being obtained and will be disclosed if she posed a risk to any other passengers on her flight,” Chant said. The aged care worker became ill at work on 24 February. She had not travelled overseas, and is the second person to have acquired the virus in the community and cannot be traced back to a source. Both people worked with vulnerable people, including hospital patients and the elderly. “It is concerning when we have somebody present with coronavirus and we can’t track the source,” Hazzard said. “So that raises the question, how did she end up with coronavirus?” Hazzard said. The doctor had been in close contact with eight patients.   Related: Australian government stimulus package to protect economy from coronavirus impact expected within days    People are thought to be most contagious when they are most sick, so out of caution health authorities trace back an infected person’s contacts to the day before they fell ill. As a result, 11 of the health worker’s patients had been placed in isolation. In Victoria on Wednesday, a man who has returned from Iran was confirmed as the 10th case of coronavirus in that state. Queensland now has 11 confirmed cases, including a 26-year-old man who returned from Iran on 26 February. But on Thursday health authorities in Queensland said the housemate of a 20-year-old international student who contracted the virus was not also infected. Queensland’s chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, said on Wednesday the man had felt unwell before the flight so authorities were tracking down people who had sat within two rows of him to recommend they begin 14 days of self-isolation. They have already identified and isolated nine people who had close contact with him. The state’s health minister, Steven Miles, said it was unnecessary for people to stockpile supplies against the small chance that they would be asked to go into home isolation."
35,health,UK poll finds young people's mental health hit by coronavirus,"More than 80% of young people with a history of mental ill health have found their conditions have worsened since the coronavirus crisis began in the UK, a survey has found.   Related: 'Focus on the things you can control': how to cope with radical uncertainty | Oliver Burkeman    In a study by the mental health charity YoungMinds, 2,111 people aged under 25, who had a history of mental health needs, were asked how the pandemic had affected them.  Of the 83% who said the pandemic had made their mental health worse, 32% said it had made it “much worse” and 51% said it had made it “a bit worse”. The survey was carried out during a period of immense change, between 20 March, when UK schools were closed to most students, and 25 March, when further restrictive measures had been put in place. Among the respondents who were accessing mental health support leading up to the crisis – including from the NHS, school and university counsellors, charities, helplines and private providers – 74% said they were still receiving support and 26% said they were unable to access support.   Related: Monthly poll seeks to gauge mental health of UK under coronavirus    Among those who could no longer access support, some said they had been affected due to the closure of schools, not being able to attend peer support groups or because face-to-face services could not be done online or over the phone. Others had been offered remote support but were concerned about privacy, access to technology or felt anxious about speaking on the phone or via video calls. When the charity asked respondents what had impacted their mental health the most, the loss of routine and social isolation were the most commonly cited factors. Emma Thomas, the chief executive of YoungMinds, said the pandemic was a “human tragedy that will continue to alter the lives of everyone in our society. The results of this survey show just how big an impact this has had, and will continue to have, on the mental health of young people.” Tom Madders, the director of campaigns at YoungMinds, said: “Although respondents support and understood the steps the government has taken to restrict movement, certain activities and routines were important coping mechanisms for many of them. Without them, some were concerned that they were more likely to use negative coping strategies.” Madders also suggested that maintaining a connection with family and friends, even through social media, could be beneficial but social media access should be controlled.  “Social media is a great way to stay in touch with friends,” he said, “but can also induce anxiety, especially if your feed includes constant news updates. It’s important that young people know that they can control their feed by unfollowing or muting the accounts that might make them feel worse.”       Jacob, 22, a YoungMinds activist, said his panic attacks had returned for the first time in three years and he had also had difficulty sleeping and eating. “My counsellor is continuing my weekly sessions online and it’s invaluable to have that time to talk through my anxieties and help me rationalise them,” he said. “I’m talking to my friends and family about how I’m feeling which is helping and also limiting the amount of news I watch or read, and baking or being creative instead.”"
36,health,Covid-19: UK prisoners with health issues 'face death sentences',"Maurice Stevens has been fighting to highlight the injustice of his son’s imprisonment for more than a decade – but with the Covid-19 pandemic claiming its first death among the 83,000 prisoners in England and Wales the pressure is on. An 84-year-old sex offender was confirmed as the first British inmate to die after contracting coronavirus, with another 19 prisoners infected across 10 prisons. The death and rising number of cases behind bars has prompted calls for those with underlying health conditions to be at least temporarily released. Stevens’s son, Danny Weatherson, 31, is in Northumberland prison. He was 17 when he was sentenced to a minimum term of 15 months for attempted robbery of a phone and a coat under a controversial imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentence. Under IPPs, which were abolished in 2012 after a European court found them to be unlawful, offenders were given a minimum term but no release date. The sentences were used far more widely than intended, and in many cases for relatively low-level crimes. Aside from a brief period of release during which he was recalled to prison, Weatherson has been in jail for 14 years and his father has been fighting to raise the profile of his son’s plight ever since. Eight months ago, Weatherson was diagnosed with two blood clots on his lung and is receiving medication. Stevens says the emergence of the coronavirus, which affects the respiratory system, has deeply troubled both father and son. “He’s just terrified now,” Stevens says from his home near Gateshead. “He was hoping for a July parole hearing but it appears all the face-to-face hearings have been suspended. I spoke to him five days ago and he was telling us all about his lungs, how they’re feeling worse.” Weatherson, who has bipolar disorder, has attempted to kill himself twice in prison, and Stevens is worried the panic over the virus could deeply upset his son. “They need to hold emergency parole hearings because of the coronavirus. He’s done a lot of time. What are they trying to achieve? They keep a lad in there for 14 years for trying to steal a phone? What does it achieve?” Appeal, a charity law practice that specialises in fighting miscarriages of justice, has called for the temporary or early release of the following groups: prisoners convicted of non-violent offences whose appeal applications have passed the single judge screening stage; prisoners on remand charged with non-violent offences; prisoners aged over 70; prisoners with pre-existing serious health conditions; pregnant women, and all prisoners in category D minimum security open prisons. Emily Bolton, Appeal’s legal director, said: “For the government to leave prisoners to die of Covid-19 behind bars when these deaths could be avoided is like leaving prisoners to drown in Orleans parish prison when the waters rose after Hurricane Katrina. “Britain is better than this, and time is running out to avoid minor offences becoming capital crimes, and life sentences from becoming death sentences.” One of Appeal’s cases is that of Roger Khan, a man with Barret’s Oesphagus, a condition which causes wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness.     HMP Oakwood prison near Wolverhampton, where a coronavirus case has been confirmed. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian    Khan, 66, is in Oakwood prison, where a case of Covid-19 has been confirmed. He was sentenced to 30 years for attempted murder and has been in prison for nine years. His partner, Marie, who asked to use a pseudonym, said: “I’m worried he’s going to die in prison. That does worry me. He’s really ill. “I’d like him to be released on tag because of his health. He shouldn’t be around the prison with the coronavirus; if he gets it he will die.” Marie said Khan had had pleurisy, which affects the lungs, and was currently isolated in Oakwood as he was classed as vulnerable. “I’m quite disgusted with the prison and fearful for Roger. He should be released on medical grounds.” Another Appeal case is that of Jon Beere, one of the Freshwater Five – five men jailed for smuggling 255kg of cocaine worth £53m in a fishing boat. Beere, 51, who is also in Oakwood, was jailed for 24 years and has served nine. He is due to be released automatically in three years and is currently a category D prisoner. After a long battle to appeal against the conviction, Beere has been granted a permission hearing before three judges and is waiting for a date. His wife, Sue, who lives on the Isle of Wight, said: “He rang me to say Oakwood had its first confirmed case. The guy is in healthcare in isolation, and there’s another 15 people in isolation, on lockdown, on the same wing.” She said her husband was “a ‘red band’ prisoner, which means he’s a trusted prisoner, so he has access to all the different wings and does jobs, like maintenance, supplies. “He is literally on every wing, so in that respect that worries me because he could have come into contact – we know how long the germs can live on metal surfaces, prison is pretty much full of metal surfaces.” She said the authorities should release all category D prisoners or those who had a short time left to serve. John Whitwam, the managing director of G4S Custodial and Detention Services, which operates Oakwood prison, said: “We have confirmed one case of coronavirus at HMP Oakwood. The health and safety of our staff and the people in our care is our top priority and we have existing, well-developed policies and procedures in place to manage outbreaks of infectious diseases.“We are in regular discussion with Public Health England and are following their guidance. The person concerned had already been self-isolating since last Tuesday, in accordance with national guidance, and will remain in isolation and in regular consultation with our on-site health professionals. His family have been contacted and will be kept up to date.” A Prison Service spokesperson said: “The government’s absolute priority is to protect health and we have robust and flexible plans in place to keep prisoners, staff and the wider public safe based on the latest advice from Public Health England.”"
37,health,NMC Health asks for debt standstill amid accounting scandal,"Troubled hospitals provider NMC Health has asked its banks for an “informal standstill” on its debt payments as it faces a cash crunch amid an accounting scandal. NMC, a member of the FTSE 100 index, said on Monday it was asking lenders to hold off from exercising their rights, which could include demands for debt payments or collateral, on the company’s £2bn debt pile. The London-listed company, which is based in Abu Dhabi and runs private hospitals in the Middle East, is in crisis after it revealed accounting inconsistencies, including revelations over the ownership of shares that could trigger the debt payments. The group, which treated over 7.5 million patients in 2018, reported revenues of $2.1bn (£1.6bn) in the same year. It faces a cash crunch if its lenders call in the debts. The latest development was prompted by the admission that the combined stakes of the main shareholders: Bavaguthu Raghuram Shetty, the founder and co-chair of the company, Saeed Mohamed Butti al-Qebaisi and Khaleefa Butti al-Muhairi , had fallen below 30%. The terms of NMC’s debts include “change of control” provisions – including a requirement that the principal shareholders own more than 30% of the business between them – that allow the banks to call in their loans with only five days’ notice. NMC has hired investment bank Moelis &amp; Company, accountancy firm PwC and lawyers Allen &amp; Overy to advise on discussions with its lenders as well as managing the company’s finances. The Financial Conduct Authority last week opened an investigation into the company after trading in its shares on the London Stock Exchange was suspended and the company fired its chief executive, Prasanth Manghat, and granted its chief financial officer, Prashanth Shenoy, “extended sick leave”. The clearout at the top of the company came after a board-commissioned investigation by the former FBI director Louis Freeh found that the company had entered into $335m of secret financing arrangements that were used by entities controlled by Shetty and Khaleefa Butti, another of the main shareholders. The turmoil at the group was triggered by a December report by short-selling hedge fund Muddy Waters, which said it had concerns over asset values, cash balance, reported profits, and reported debt levels, as well as possible fraud and theft. NMC denied those allegations."
38,health,Uncertain times lead to rise in mental health challenges for athletes,"Leading medical journal The Lancet recently published a position paper authored by 24 mental health experts. It begins: “It is already evident that the direct and indirect psychological and social effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic are pervasive and could affect mental health now and in the future.” It is a hypothesis substantiated by Professional Footballers Australia who last week published findings of a survey of over 150 of its members. Since the suspension of professional football in Australia, 58% of players have reported symptoms of anxiety while 45% demonstrated symptoms of depression. Ordinarily, moderate-to-severe anxiety reporting peaks at about 8%.   Related: ‘A priceless time at home’: Australia's Alex Carey takes positives from lockdown life | Scott Heinrich    “The hardest thing is the uncertainty,” Central Coast Mariners striker Matt Simon tells Guardian Australia. “We’ve gone from being around teammates every single day and training every day to all of a sudden just being stood down without pay and no word on what’s going to be happening and no word on when the next payment is coming for everyone’s livelihoods.” Such uncertainty must now be prevalent in most workforces, making the insight into professional sportspeople all the more instructive. This is a cohort synonymous with high achievement, resilience and an abundance of positive reinforcement. “I think there are a lot of misconceptions about professional athletes,” Simon argues. “I saw a story a couple of weeks ago saying that we shouldn’t feel sorry for A-League players because they’ve been stood down without pay. I thought that was an absolute joke, because what about the player that’s sacrificed so much, is not on a lot of money, but he just does it because he loves the game and he’s got three kids at home? Now all of a sudden he has no money coming in. They are stressful times for a player – how is he going to feed his kids?” Footballers are the victims of greater uncertainty than professionals from other high-profile local sports. The shutdown arrived before the conclusion of drawn-out negotiations to decouple the A-League and W-League from Football Federation Australia. There has been some ad-hoc devolution but no clear resolution, leaving the game looking in many directions for answers. The situation is made even more perilous by the reluctance of Fox Sports to continue its financial investment in Australian football. The broadcaster has indicated it is looking to withdraw from football as soon as possible, and the absence of matches to broadcast has provided it grounds to withhold the latest quarterly $12m payment to A-League clubs. A legal stoush looms. Little has been said on the record. What does that mean on the ground? “The silence from the governing bodies, not coming out and giving us any answers, I don’t think is great,” says Simon. “Obviously, some people know what’s going on and discussions are behind closed doors. I think those people need to come out and say what’s happening. If something doesn’t happen sooner or later, like many people around the country, we’re going to have to start looking at different avenues for employment.” There may be some comparisons to draw with the demise of the old National Soccer League, but the current crisis is arguably more acute, as Beau Busch, PFA’s head of player development, outlines. “When the NSL ended there were opportunities to play in the NPL, Asia, or Europe. The current level of uncertainty is unprecedented,” he says. This heightened anxiety around financial insecurity is compounded by isolation from teammates and interruptions to training routines, key pillars of an athlete’s mental health. “Players are used to being surrounded by people on a daily basis and there isn’t really any substitute for that,” Busch says. Or as Simon puts it: “I think all players would be saying they miss the banter in the change room, when you play football for a long period of time your teammates pretty much become your family and you do take it for granted when it gets taken away from you.” The importance of camaraderie to mental health is not unique to the professional game. All across the country weekend warriors are now missing their fix of mateship.   Related: Australian football's Fox Sports conundrum – looming disaster or reset opportunity? | Richard Parkin    “Local sporting clubs play such an important community cohesion role around Australia and a tough side of the isolation requirements is the loss of the regular social and physical contact with fellow sporting club members,” explains Dr Grant Blashki, Beyond Blue’s lead clinical advisor. “There is good evidence that sporting activities are excellent for maintaining wellbeing because they usually combine physical exercise, social connectedness and routine, which are all very beneficial. Beyond Blue’s evidence-based A Guide To What Works, which reviews treatments and strategies used to improve mental health, shows exercise can be of significant benefit. “We’re encouraging people to plan a weekly schedule in their calendar, including exercise, even if that just involves working out in front of a YouTube video or going for a walk on your own.” But before despair takes root, Dr Blashki has some words of reassurance. “It’s important to maintain hope and focus on how good things are going to be when sporting codes get back to doing what they do best on the sporting field on the other side of the pandemic.”"
39,health,TV station's interview with David Icke 'posed threat to public health',"The local television station London Live is facing sanctions after the media regulator, Ofcom, found it had posed a threat to the public’s health by showing a lengthy interview with David Icke about the coronavirus pandemic. The little-watched channel, owned by Evening Standard boss Evgeny Lebedev, broadcast an 80-minute interview with the former footballer and noted conspiracy theorist earlier this month. Icke used the broadcast to claim without evidence that the pandemic was cover for a supposed global world order to purposefully crash the economy, end the use of cash payments, and track every individual. In a separate ruling on coverage relating to Covid-19, ITV was also warned to take care how it reports on repeatedly debunked claims linking 5G mobile phone networks to coronavirus, following comments by This Morning’s Eamonn Holmes.  Ofcom said London Live’s decision to broadcast the Icke interview “had the potential to cause significant harm to viewers in London during the pandemic” because his views were not sufficiently challenged by the host and viewers were not given extra context on the claims. The channel had argued that it should not be sanctioned for showing the interview with Icke on the basis he was exercising freedom of expression. London Live said this was particularly important in the current circumstances, when civil liberties are being “constrained” and “threatened”. The station also said it was essential to question “conventional wisdom” and government action in a “responsible” manner. Among the material London Live covered were assertions by Icke that Covid-19 was being used as a weapon of war by the US and Israel against Iran, as well as suggestions that any plan to immunise the world with a coronavirus vaccine was a plot to infect people with a “tidal wave of toxic shite”. The broadcast was edited by London Live staff from a longer interview conducted for the similarly named but unrelated YouTube channel London Real.   Related: Conspiracy theorist David Icke hits back after Australia revokes visa    In a sign of how different forms of media are regulated, the London Live broadcast was watched by just 80,000 people, but has attracted regulatory scrutiny and sanctions. Meanwhile, a version of the original London Real interview remains available on YouTube, where it has racked up almost 6m views with no regulatory issues. London Live unsuccessfully argued that it would be “illogical” and “unfair” for Ofcom to penalise it for broadcasting material that was still available on YouTube. A different interview involving Icke and London Real has been removed by YouTube, although none of it was broadcast on London Live. Icke has enjoyed the attention paid to him as a result of the controversy around the broadcast, with Google search interest in his name spiking as a result. Ofcom separately concluded that Holmes’s comments on ITV’s This Morning that people should challenge “the state narrative” around 5G phone masts “were ill judged and risked undermining viewers’ trust in advice from public authorities and scientific evidence”.  Although it said this was irresponsible, given recent attacks on mobile phone masts in the UK, it concluded that his subsequent clarification and other comments making clear the link was “fake news” meant there was no need to formally sanction ITV."
40,health,Half of UK health workers suffering stress because of Covid-19,"Half of health workers are suffering mental health problems such as stress and trauma as a result of dealing with Covid-19, new research reveals. The pandemic is having a “severe impact” on the mental wellbeing of NHS personnel as well as agency staff, GPs and dentists, with rates of anxiety and burnout also running far higher than usual. New YouGov polling for the IPPR thinktank found that 50% of 996 healthcare workers questioned across the UK said their mental health had deteriorated since the virus began taking its toll. That emerged as the biggest impact on staff, just ahead of worries about their family’s safety because of a lack of testing and protective equipment for NHS workers (49%) and concern about their ability to ensure that patients receive high-quality care when the NHS is so busy (43%).   Related: Military veterans help draft PTSD guidance for NHS workers    As many as 71% of younger health professionals, who are likely to be inexperienced and early in their careers, said their mental health had deteriorated. More women were affected than men. Just 30% of staff felt that the government was doing enough to protect their mental health; 42% said too little was being done, including 43% of those working in hospitals. The survey findings come amid rising concern that the unprecedented challenges of treating so many people who are seriously unwell or dying will have a catastrophic mental effect on staff, including those working in intensive care and elsewhere developing post-traumatic stress disorder. The IPPR is concerned that the psychological demands of working in the NHS during the pandemic are also an important reason why its research found that as many as one in five staff may quit. The higher rates of burnout and stress at the frontline are a key factor, it says. “Our care heroes are making significant sacrifices to pull our country through this crisis. It is imperative [the] government does not allow their efforts to become a modern Charge of the Light Brigade,” said IPPR research fellow Chris Thomas, the lead author of the report. Asked to select their priorities for government action in the next few weeks, more health staff cited greater support for their mental health (60%) than improved access to testing for coronavirus. NHS bodies across the UK have increased the availability of mental health help, especially online. Overall, 21% of those questioned by YouGov earlier this month said that Covid-19 had made them more likely to stop working in health. That could see the NHS in England alone lose 300,000 of its 1.5 million-strong workforce, said the IPPR. It warned that without “bold action” by ministers on PPE and testing, “healthcare capacity could be impacted for years after the end of the Covid-19 crisis”.   Related: NHS staff to be offered mental health support for Covid-19 'shell shock'    Ministers should recognise the huge contribution made by NHS staff to tackling the pandemic with a package of measures to reward them once the virus has gone, the IPPR believes. “Now, just as after world war one there was the ‘homes fit for heroes’ drive and after world war two the establishment of the ‘cradle to grave’ NHS, the government must now deliver ‘care fit for carers’,” the report adds. It wants the government to award all health and care workers a “Covid-19 pay bonus” equivalent to 10% of their salary for everyone working in the sector in 2020-21, much better mental health support for those who need it, and a new bank holiday to celebrate health professionals. “Individual staff members will be coping personally with the Covid-19 pandemic in their own way and at their own pace, and will continue to look after patients and those they care for, many of whom are scarred by their experiences,” said Dr Emma Vaux, the Royal College of Physicians’ vice-president for education and training. Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England, said: “This report makes clear the very real and varied impacts of this devastating outbreak of Covid-19 on the lives of health and care staff, and the wider general public. It is extremely concerning over 70% of healthcare professionals felt the government has not been doing enough to protect and test them, while there is also a worrying level of dissatisfaction in the availability of mental health support for staff, particularly among nurses and midwives.” An NHS England spokesperson said: “NHS staff are currently fighting the biggest healthcare challenge in generations, so extra support is both needed and available, including offering NHS mental health support within trusts, and new text, online and telephone support services.” "
41,health,"Private health firm to create 10,000 new jobs for carers","Private healthcare company Cera Care is creating 10,000 new jobs for home carers to support elderly or vulnerable people during the coronavirus outbreak, and to provide work for those who have lost their jobs. 
The firm said it will offer successful applicants training courses and assessments through its digital platform, allowing them to become formally certified as carers and able to start earning money after 10 days. 
The home care company said it wants people who have lost their jobs in retail, hospitality, travel or other sectors during the outbreak to apply for the roles, which involve providing care to elderly or vulnerable people in their own home. 
Cera Care, which employs 2,000 people nationwide, is creating positions across the UK. 
 
  
  
   
    
    Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:
    
     a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back
     a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly
    
    NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;stay at home for at least 7 days.
    If you live with other people,&nbsp;they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.
    After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.&nbsp;Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.
    If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.
    If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.
    After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.
    If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.
    If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.
    Staying at home means you should:
    
     not go to work, school or public areas
     not use public transport or taxis
     not have visitors, such as friends and family, in your home
     not go out to buy food or collect medicine – order them by phone or online, or ask someone else to drop them off at your home
    
    You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.

Horus Patel, Cera’s chief technology officer, said the firm is using its existing technology to help people return to work, and that the roles are intended to last beyond the peak of the outbreak. 
“These are long-term positions within our company, and we hope this will encourage those recently left without work, or even those currently employed, to consider getting trained and becoming part of this crucial community,” Patel said. 
The government has advised eight million people aged over 70, or 12% of the UK population, as well as those with pre-existing medical conditions, to remain at home and avoid unnecessary social contact for at least 12 weeks to protect themselves from the spread of Covid-19. Cera Care says on its website that its carers are “trained to reduce the risk of infection”. 
The London-based firm, which was founded in November 2016, currently provides more than 10,000 care visits each day. 
Cera, which is regulated by the Care Quality Commission, says it improves care services for elderly people through data analytics. 
In addition, Cera’s app can provide family members and medical workers with current information about an individual’s health. 
Cera has partnerships with organisations such as the NHS, Uber, Deliveroo and IBM."
42,health,‘The most stressful time ever’: how coronavirus affects children’s mental health,"Barnet Pavão-Zuckerman’s 10-year-old daughter worries about her parents when they leave their home in Silver Spring, Maryland, to get groceries. She’s concerned about her grandparents, too. And, though she’s been busy with virtual playdates and online learning, she’s bothered by the thought that she may never get to see her friends or teacher again in person. “This is kind of a lot,” the girl told her mom recently. Her seven-year-old brother is still too young to express how he feels in words. So instead, he screams and storms out of the house. Then, he sits cross-legged in the driveway, taking deep breaths. “This is truly the most stressful time that they’ve ever experienced,” Barnet said. A generation of children and teenagers in the US who were born under the specter of international terrorism, raised during an economic recession and educated under the threat of near-constant school shootings is facing yet another trauma: a pandemic that’s already racked up a devastating body count and completely upended their lives. “All of those environmental factors have led to an increase in anxiety among our young people, and I think this will only add more fuel to the fire,” said Nance Roy, chief clinical officer at the JED Foundation, a not-for-profit that partners with schools and colleges to strengthen their mental health programs. Mary Alvord, a Maryland-based psychologist, likened the pandemic to the second world war because “when you go to war, it’s sort of across the board”. Asked if the health crisis would be a defining moment or shift for children, much like 9/11 was for millennials, other mental health professionals called it a “burgeoning reality” that was on its way, if not already here. “I certainly see it as being one,” said Janine Domingues, a psychologist at the Child Mind Institute in New York. But, she countered, “just like with 9/11, there are ways in which we can increase resilience in children, and teens, and young adults, and even for us”.     Molly Maguire, eight, uses chalk to calculate an addition problem in her driveway. At least 55.1 million students have been impacted by school closures during the pandemic. Photograph: Reuters    At least 55.1 million students have been affected by school closures during the pandemic, roughly 97% of all public and private school students in the US, according to Education Week. Classes have gone virtual and, in some cases, are pre-recorded instead of live. Huge swaths of kids are ditching classes and pre-existing inequalities within school districts are only getting worse despite schools scrambling to supply students with the technology they need to keep learning. “We’re so privileged,” Barnet said. “There’re other kids in the class that, if their parents have to work … do they have the wherewithal to get on the laptop?” As the US struggles with more than 600,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases – by far the most anywhere in the world – it’s unclear when schools in hard-hit cities and states will reopen. New York City has said all public schools will remain closed for the remainder of the academic year, and the city’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, empathized with kids cooped up at home. “There’s too much information available, too many real difficult things put before our children, even in normal times,” said De Blasio. “Now think about what these last weeks have been like for our children. Think about the disruption. Think about the confusion and in so many cases the trauma.” Back in Silver Spring, Yamel Alcantara’s two-year-old has become clingier than usual, asking to be carried most of the time. Alcantara’s six- and eight-year-olds have started washing their hands more often, to the tune of Happy Birthday or The ABCs. They would prefer to be at school, but instead they’re doing distance learning, playing with dolls in their backyard and riding bikes. “I’m actually surprised by how well they’ve taken it,” Alcantara said. Some young people are happy to stay home, mental health professionals said, especially younger kids who are more family-focused or young people who don’t like school. But others are struggling. “I think that for a lot of children, this is going to be traumatic, but how people respond to trauma can range from them being passive and withdrawn to them being angry, and irritable, and agitated. So there isn’t going to be any universal response to this because that’s not how trauma works,” said Sarah Y Vinson, a psychiatrist in Atlanta. Children already dealing with pre-existing psychological conditions are among the most vulnerable to exacerbated mental health concerns. Stephen Neff, a psychiatric nurse practitioner in New Jersey, said he’s had times lately where every slot on his schedule fills up and gets double-booked. Janine Domingues, a psychologist at the Child Mind Institute in New York, said at least half her patients have experienced an increase in their symptoms. “There is a higher risk for people who are struggling with pre-existing mental health conditions, but at the same time, the crises that we’re facing – financially, emotionally, socially – are worrisome for everyone,” Roy said.     Lydia Hassebroek looks out at the view from her window in Brooklyn, New York. Photograph: Caitlin Ochs/Reuters    Some children are also dealing with more serious traumatic events related to Covid-19, such as the sickness or deaths of family members, or relatives experiencing job losses that make it harder to feed their loved ones. Those personal tragedies could put kids at greater risk of lasting mental health effects, said Domingues. “It might be nice initially to have [a parent] at home all day,” Neff said. “But I think if they begin to be clear on the financial reality or they see things tighten up, I think that is probably gonna be yet another layer of concern.” Minority communities are shouldering more grief than others, as victims of the disease in some parts of the country are disproportionately black and Latino. “The mental health burden on kids from this is not gonna be equally distributed because, you know, the major losses are not equally distributed,” Vinson said. Mary Alvord, a Maryland-based psychologist, said that she’s heard from kids who think of Covid-19 as a potential threat to themselves, a radical shift from a month ago, when they were primarily concerned for their grandparents. But a lot of young people are still just grappling with their much lonelier new normal. The almost universal stay-at-home orders across the US have meant a necessary retreat into technology. There’s no more sports, prom or graduation. Friends are always a screen away even as alerts about the risks of Covid-19 flood the TV or pop up online. The World Health Organization, which has in the past warned against “gaming disorder”, is actively encouraging people to play video games. “Thank goodness” for social media platforms, Roy said, so at least young people can stay connected. But scrolling on Instagram isn’t always enough. In Littleton, Colorado, Barnet’s sister Gretel had to have a serious conversation with her 17-year-old son after he snuck out to visit his high school girlfriend. “He couldn’t see [the] bigger picture,” Gretel said. Her 15-year-old son has fared much better. When she walks into his room, he’s safely playing video games while FaceTiming with his friends. “This is an unprecedented time. But you look at kids who survived wars and bombs. And so, you know, I feel like for the most part we really can build resilience and be OK,” said Alvord. Barnet’s daughter just celebrated her birthday, during the pandemic. She had to cancel her Harry Potter-themed party, but her family made a cake and got takeout from her favorite Italian restaurant. In the morning, a bunch of friends and neighbors gathered on the street outside her house, six feet apart. They brought drums and sang to her. “She was totally mortified, but I was crying,” Barnet said. “It was really sweet.”"
43,health,"Diet, health, inequality: why Britain's food supply system doesn't work","Tim Lang likes to take the long view. A conversation with the internationally renowned professor of food policy at London’s City University will roam in detail from the repeal of the Corn Laws, through Brexit and back again, the narrative seasoned with detailed facts and figures. It’s why he has been a consultant to the World Health Organization, special adviser to four House of Commons select committee inquiries and a food policy adviser to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. So when he says in his new book, Feeding Britain, that, “although not officially at war, the UK is, de facto, facing a wartime scale of food challenge”, it’s worth paying attention. We are, he says, in serious trouble. Lang, who established the pioneering Centre for Food Policy at City University in 1994, makes no apologies for the bluntness of the statement. “I did not write that lightly,” he says, when we meet in central London. “I sat in my study, reviewing all the data. Things have just got worse.” Even so, he recognises how it looks. Panic buying aside, our supermarket shelves are usually full. We have access to a greater range of ingredients at better prices than at any time in human history. The conversation around how and what we eat often feels like it sits front and centre of the culture. “I like my food,” he says. “More joy around food has come into our lives.”    There’s a staggering gap between rich and poor in terms of wealth and income and therefore access to food  Tim Lang     And yet, he says, all of that masks a bitter reality: we have a massively fragile just-in-time supply chain which could easily collapse; a depleted agriculture sector which produces only around 50% of the food we actually eat, leaving us at the mercies of the international markets; and production methods which are damaging to the environment and human health. “When I looked at the numbers on inequality,” he says, “I was shocked. There’s a staggering gap between rich and poor in terms of wealth and income and therefore access to food.” As he says: “Food is the biggest driver of NHS spending as a result of obesity, diabetes and heart disease.” Food may look cheap, he adds, but too much of it creates vast, unsustainable costs elsewhere. His doorstep of a book attempts both diagnosis and cure. Consciously, it pushes the impact of Brexit to one side to get at the underlying dysfunction. Likewise, we agree to discuss the implications of coronavirus later. Nevertheless, he says, it all amounts to the same thing. “There is a mismatch between human need, the food system and its outcomes.” At the heart of this crisis is a British willingness to let a small number of corporations dominate food retailing: just eight companies control 90% of our food supply. “It’s the ‘leave it to Tesco’ approach,” he says. The prioritisation of price has hollowed out UK agriculture, so that primary producers get the smallest slice of the cake. “They get about 5% or 6% of the value of the food we buy. They need double that. And that 50% self-sufficiency should be nearer 80%. Not out of nationalism, but so we are in a position to contribute globally. We have a default position of assuming someone else will feed us.”     ‘We have a default position that someone else will feed us’: empty supermarket shelves, one consequence of the coronavirus. Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA         The book comes freighted with eye-popping data. For example, of the six million hectares of cultivatable land in Britain, only 168,000 hectares are used for fruit and vegetables. As a result, we have to import vast amounts of crops we could otherwise be growing. Much of the remaining land is used for crops to feed livestock or for processed foods. “The government is now so reliant on the retailers, they are setting them up to fail,” he says. “At the height of the arguments over a no-deal Brexit, the heads of the big food companies were briefing the government about just how fragile the food supply chain is. Brexit has shone a spotlight on that fragility.” I ask where he thinks this dysfunctional system has come from. “There is a culture of British exceptionalism. We were the first industrial nation in the 18th century and then became the dominant imperial power in the 19th century and pursued that as a way of feeding ourselves.” Critics often point out that we were less self-sufficient in food in the early 20th century than we are now. True, Lang says, but that was specifically because we had an empire which we ravaged to keep our tables and bellies full. He’s at pains to acknowledge that he is not the first person to raise these issues. He first became interested in the subject in the 1970s when, having just completed his social psychology PhD, he started farming in Wales. He came across a book called Our Food Problem and Its Relation to Our National Defences, published in 1939. One of its authors was Frederick Le Gros Clark, a sometime children’s writer who went on to become an expert in malnutrition. Like Lang, he argued that the British food supply chain was exceedingly delicate and was not serving the health of the nation. The outbreak of war would prove him right. There was also a review of the British food system in 1936 by William Beveridge, later architect of the welfare state, who made similar arguments. “Beveridge was totally ignored,” Lang says.    When the new agriculture bill was introduced in January, it had almost nothing about food  Tim Lang     In the summer of 2019, then Defra secretary Michael Gove announced he was establishing a national food strategy, which was broadly welcomed by the food industry. He put his friend Henry Dimbleby, the co-founder of the Leon healthy fast-food chain, in charge of the review, even though he has no academic credentials in the field. Lang is polite about the classic British choice of a non-expert generalist to lead the review, but he does say that he’s concerned that, like Beveridge, Dimbleby’s review will be ignored when it’s eventually published. “When the new agriculture bill was introduced in January, it had almost nothing about food,” he says. What’s Lang’s solution? It’s detailed and includes the introduction of a food resilience and sustainability act, complete with legally binding targets. National nutritional guidelines should become the basis for food procurement contracts, both public and private. There should be an audit of food production in the UK and the budget for public health should be doubled from £2.5bn of the £130bn health budget to £5bn. It also proposes the creation of no fewer than nine bodies or institutions, including a royal commission to map a new set of “multi-criteria principles for the UK food system”, a food resilience and sustainability council and a network of urban and rural food and farming colleges.     Among Tim Lang’s solutions for sustainability is an audit of food production in the UK: apple harvesting in Somerset. Photograph: Alamy    I suggest this is an old-fashioned 1970s corporatist approach; that he’s proposing a massive expansion of the state to deal with the problem. “I think I’ve been pretty modest,” Lang says. “The British state is failing us by not decentralising.” He also calls for Tesco, which has around 30% of the food retail market, to be broken up, so that no one firm has more than 15%. Likewise, he calls for pension funds to disinvest from manufacturers of ultra-processed foods, as some have started doing with fossil fuels. The list goes on. He insists, however, that this is not some kneejerk leftist manifesto. “We just need to re-engineer how capitalism works for us.” We agree we can no longer ignore the viral elephant both inside the room and outside it. Might the coronavirus crisis help with the re-engineering of our food supply chain? He agrees, sadly, that it might. “It could prove a good reminder of the value of state institutions,” he says. And the emptying of shelves as a result of panic buying may help people to “think about where their food comes from”. He adds: “We need to move from a ‘me’ food culture to a ‘we’ food culture.” It’s a very simple message, but in the white heat of a crisis, defined by queues outside supermarkets, a useful one. • The headline of this article was amended on 23 March 2020 to more accurately reflect the content and context of the interview with Lang.

44,health,"August Tour de France 'recipe for disaster', public health expert warns","Devi Sridhar, the chair of Global Public Health at the University of Edinburgh and also a key adviser to the Scottish government on the Covid-19 pandemic, has described the plan to stage the Tour de France in August as a “recipe for disaster”. “The wise thing to do is cancel for this year,” Sridhar said. “It’s a painful decision but they have no choice.” The Tour was moved this week from its original start date in late June to a new Grand Départ in Nice on 29 August, following the banning of any large public events until 11 July by the French president, Emmanuel Macron.   Related: Chris Froome ready for long-awaited return to cycling following crash    “This is a long-term problem, a chronic problem,” Sridhar told cyclingnews.com. “This virus is here to stay and will come back. Even if France gets a handle on it by August, then of course the issue is people coming in from different countries.” Sridhar pointed to a series of potential risks, that might even lead to the Tour being halted if there was an outbreak within the race convoy during the race. “There’s definitely a risk that the Tour de France moving around and unwittingly spreading the virus could kick-start a new lockdown.” While the Tour’s television partners were delighted to hear the race was going ahead – “It’s very good news,” said Laurent Prud’homme, director general of French Eurosport – Sridhar urged the Tour owner ASO to rethink its plan. “They have to weigh the risks against the benefits. Thousands of people from all over the world, gathered together, moving around, from town to town, this is where a virus could thrive – it could be a recipe for disaster,” Sridhar said. She also suggested those arriving in Nice for the race from countries outside France should be quarantined. “This [the arrival of the Tour’s international convoy] could set off a new cluster of infections so you’d have to think, at minimum, of a two- to three-week quarantine before they properly come into the country.” Ideally, Sridhar said, while acknowledging the logistics would be “mind-boggling”, once the race has started the organisation would test everybody in the convoy every day. “We know 20% to 60% of people are pre-symptomatic, in that they feel fine and exhibit no symptoms but are passing the virus to others.” While most European riders have reacted positively to the new scheduling, the participation of some, including the defending champion Egan Bernal, who is confined to Colombia, is not yet a given. “It hasn’t escaped me that the current champion is in Colombia, but Europe is at the heart of cycling and the majority of riders live in Europe,” the Tour director, Christian Prudhomme, said. The rescheduled dates have also caused a headache for other lesser race promoters, including the Tour of Britain organiser Sweetspot, as the postponed Tour de France now clashes with its own race on 6-13 September. Another problem for the British race is a clash of live TV coverage as the official race broadcaster ITV also shows each stage of the French race. “The position we find ourselves in is unprecedented,” Sweetspot said in a statement. “We are closely monitoring each development as it happens and acting accordingly with our partners and stakeholders across Britain to do the right thing, with the health and wellbeing of all of our supporters being of paramount importance.”"
45,health,Ruby Princess crew fear for their health as ship leaves Australia,"Crew on board the Ruby Princess say they are worried for their health and have been “left in the dark” as the virus-hit cruise ship left Australia for the Philippines with about 500 on board. 
The ship left Port Kembla just before 5pm on Thursday, after a month in Sydney in which it has been linked to more than 600 cases of coronavirus and 21 deaths among passengers who took its final cruise to New Zealand in March. That cruise, and the decision to allow 2,700 passengers to disembark in Sydney on 19 March, is now the subject of a criminal investigation and a special commission of inquiry. 
So far, more than 190 crew have tested positive for Covid-19 and the 1,100 crew have been in varying lengths of quarantine on board for weeks. 
 
  Related: Ruby Princess hotel manager 'does not recall' if Border Force involved in cruise ship disembarkation  
 
The NSW Labor leader, Jodi McKay, said crew members had contacted her saying they did not know where they were going, and it was “a death sentence”. 
The daughter of one crew member said she feared for her father’s health if he were to contract the virus on the ship, as he is a 62-year-old diabetic with heart conditions. 
“He’s very high risk to get the Covid-19,” she wrote on Wednesday. “Yesterday night he cannot sleep because he don’t know yet what his result after the swab …. His only wish is that he will be treated in hospital if he ever got the virus. 
“I am eight months pregnant now, every night I am praying that my father will come home to us healthy and safe.” 
Another crew member wrote on Thursday that they had been “left totally in the dark” as the ship was docked in Port Kembla. 
“We were never mentioned in any of the onboard announcements for repatriation … I have repeatedly tried to call HR but no answer,” they wrote. 
“Some nationalities like myself have been left totally in the dark. There is even a repatriation flight leaving to South Africa on the 28th of April but we have been given no option to leave. We have to stay onboard and the company have not even told us where we are sailing to. 
“Who knows when I will be able to reach home! Myself and family are worried and scared what will happen next.” 
McKay said she had been contacted by crew from India, Indonesia, Peru and South Africa all expressing their concerns. 
“I don’t understand why the welfare of each and every person on the Ruby Princess has not been the priority of the NSW and federal government,” she said. “Their plight has touched the hearts of so many Australians. We will continue our advocacy – and as they head into rough seas, they are not alone.”

The family of one Filipino crew member told McKay’s office that her entire family was worried for his health. 
“I am the niece of one of the crew of the Ruby Princess,” she wrote. “He is a waiter there … we are deeply worried about his situation. My uncle is very kind, he helped me finish school and he is a bread winner of the family. He also helps my grandfather who is ill, he is the one taking care of my grandfather’s medicine.” 
A spokesman for the Ruby Princess’s operator, Carnival Australia, said “there have been announcements on board” telling crew what would happen. 
“Around 370 crew members have disembarked today for a charter flight to the Philippines organised by Princess Cruises,” he said. 
“Around 500 crew, all well, remain on board about half of whom are needed for safe operation of the ship. Ruby Princess will head to the Philippines and we will have more information to share then on crew repatriation. 
“We could have disembarked more crew in Port Kembla but they would have needed to stay in shoreside accommodation for a few days before joining a flight and authorities here wouldn’t allow this. A small number have remained on board because at this stage there was no flight pathways to get them home due to factors such as closed borders to their home countries.”

A spokesperson for NSW police said that the destination of the ship was a matter for Princess Cruises or its operator, Carnival, but that there were intensive care medical facilities on board. 
“Commissioner [Mick] Fuller has repeatedly stated that repatriation operation involved close consultation with Princess Cruises and the various consulates of crew members, as well as NSW Health and Aspen Medical to ensure those who remain on board were well enough to make the onward journey,” police said. 
“That said, the vessel has the equivalent capability of an ICU on board and highly-skilled medical staff.

46,health,Why we're tracking every US health worker who dies from coronavirus,"Lost on the frontline is a project by the Guardian and Kaiser Health News that aims to honor every healthcare worker in the US – from doctors to hospital cleaners and from nursing home aides to paramedics – who dies from Covid-19 during the pandemic.   Kaiser Health News   These are the frontline health workers who risk their own lives to care for the sick. In some states, medical staff account for as many as 20% of known coronavirus cases. But no reliable national database exists to track their deaths. As of 14 April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 27 deaths among health workers – but our reporting shows that is likely a vast undercount.  Some of these deaths are preventable. Across the world, healthcare workers face a disproportionate risk of severe infection from coronavirus due to their high exposure to sick patients. But in the US, a lack of preparedness for the pandemic increased that risk. Inadequate access to testing among the general population, a nationwide shortage of protective gear such as N95 masks, and lack of basic supplies like hand sanitizer are driving up the death toll among health workers. Collectively, our healthcare workforce has already saved thousands of lives. And in the face of a pandemic so dangerous that families can’t visit sick relatives, these workers are often the last people to comfort the dying. But some won’t make it themselves. While we can’t profile everyone in depth, our goal is to mark every death that we can confirm. The nationwide database we create will allow us to identify patterns and find new stories about the unfolding pandemic and its impact on healthcare workers, shedding light on the workings, and failings, of the healthcare system.   embed   Our count will include any healthcare worker who was likely exposed while helping patients with Covid-19 during the pandemic. That includes nurses, paramedics, doctors and other medical workers who treat patients, operate ambulances and take X-rays. It includes nursing home staff and home health aides who are caring for patients outside of hospitals. It includes cleaners, porters, administrators and other on-site staff who are disinfecting hospital rooms, washing linens and managing crucial operations to help our healthcare system function in crisis. We hope this project will become a collective memorial to honor their sacrifices. But we can’t do it alone. We’re asking the family members, friends and colleagues of healthcare workers to contribute by sharing information, photos and stories about their loved ones and co-workers who died while taking care of patients infected with coronavirus. You can share information here. We’re also inviting news organizations across the country to partner with us. We will link to local newsroom stories about workers in their communities who have died, and we will invite them to co-publish our stories. We will also work with partners to produce content in multiple languages to reflect the rich diversity of America’s healthcare workforce and reach the many communities in America experiencing loss. Because of the scope of the project, and the many categories of workers we’ve chosen to include, this database may never be completely comprehensive. It will function as an imperfect work in progress – and grow over time. You can reach the editors of this project at frontline@theguardian.com. We hope this project will honor those lost to the pandemic – and spark ideas for positive change in our healthcare system."
47,health,Wisconsin proves it: Republicans will sacrifice voters' health to keep power,"If any lingering doubts remained, Tuesday should have erased them all. Republicans will weaponize anything – even in-person voting during a deadly pandemic – to maintain power, avoid accountability and bend electoral rules in their favor. Worse, the US supreme court will have their back. Make no mistake: the deliberate chaos and unthinkable images from Wisconsin on Tuesday – Americans on line for hours, wearing homemade masks, risking a gruesome respiratory disease to exercise their right to vote – wasn’t just a warning sign for November’s elections. It was Republicans’ dress rehearsal. It’s scarcely 200 days until the real show. The coronavirus has already pushed more than a dozen states to postpone primaries and forced fearful Ohio and Wisconsin governors into court the day before an election, desperate to avoid worsening a public health crisis. It’s quite likely that the virus will threaten in-person voting in many states and cities in November as well. That’s why a growing non-partisan chorus has called for expanding vote-by-mail options this fall. It can be done; five states already conduct all their elections this way and every state allows some level of mail-in voting. It doesn’t favor either party – just ask Republicans in Utah and Colorado. It’s safer during a pandemic, but also secure: a study of hundreds of millions of votes in Oregon, ever since it became the first to adopt all-mail elections, found fewer than 15 fraudulent ballots cast over more than a decade.    Nothing about the Wisconsin election was normal    Republicans, however, have fought efforts to fund expanded voting options this fall. President Trump recently told Fox &amp; Friends: “If you’d ever agreed to it, you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.” On Wednesday, he tweeted that vote by mail creates “tremendous potential” for voter fraud and mused that “for whatever reason, [it] doesn’t work out well for Republicans”. Georgia’s state house speaker knows that reason, opposing it because it “will certainly drive up turnout” and “will be extremely devastating to Republicans and conservatives”. But while the quiet part sometimes comes out louder than expected, most of the Republican party’s anti-vote-by-mail excuses are ludicrous. If the president’s intention is to conjure phoney visions of voter fraud, others hope to simply slow-walk reform. When Senate Democrats attempted to add election protection safeguards to the first coronavirus stimulus package, the Republican senator John Barrasso insisted they “have no place in an emergency rescue package for the American people”. Election assistance funding, sniffed his colleague Marsha Blackburn, “has nothing to do with Covid-19”.   Related: Yes, Wisconsin Republicans used the pandemic to stop people from voting | Lawrence Douglas    On Tuesday, however, the connection between voting and the virus should have been clear enough for even a Republican senator to see. When Robin Vos, Wisconsin’s Republican assembly speaker, tried to deny it, he wore a mask and full personal protective gear. He looked like one of those mean government agents looking to capture ET, which only undercut his assurances that voters stacked up in the five available Milwaukee precincts had absolutely nothing to fear. Nothing about the Wisconsin election was normal. Not voters in homemade masks, not the immunocompromised woman whose requested absentee ballot never arrived voting in full bubble wrap, not the plaintive signs that read “this is ridiculous”. But the five conservative Republican appointees to the US supreme court, concerned, ruefully and almost comically, that something might “fundamentally alter the nature of the election”, stepped in … on the side of forcing tens of thousands of Wisconsinites to brave the pandemic and vote in person. Along a dreary 5-4 party line vote, the supreme court’s conservative majority, most appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote, overturned two lower-court rulings that had extended the vote-by-mail deadline until next week, despite evidence that tens of thousands of absentee ballots had yet to be delivered to voters who requested them, and that untold thousands more might not be postmarked in time. Ruling comfortably from their own living rooms, the five conservatives required these voters to leave their homes during a shelter-in-place order and placed them in the path of a virus. (On Wednesday, the day after the election, reports came of absentee ballots piled in post offices, undelivered.) That the supreme court intervened not on the side of voters and fair elections, but in order to protect particular Republican partisan interests, should be saddening, yet unsurprising. Chief Justice John Roberts arrived in Washington almost 30 years ago as a young justice department appointee with a particular interest: eroding the protections of the Voting Rights Act (VRA). Under his leadership, this court has embraced his cramped vision with gusto.

Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images    The Roberts court has made clear that it should not be looked to as any guarantor of the foundational right to vote. Not in an emergency. Not at all. In 2013’s Shelby County v Holder, a 5-4 court defanged the enforcement provisions of section V of the VRA and laid the groundwork for a decade of voter ID requirements, precinct closures and voter roll purges from states with documented histories of racist voting inequities. The legislatures behind those efforts, a 5-4 court decreed in 2018’s Abbott v Texas, must be awarded the “presumption of good faith” – even for naked racial gerrymandering schemes. Those voter roll purges were upheld in 2018’s Husted v A Philip Randolph Institute, where the court, again 5-4, created a non-existent loophole that justified canceling registrations if a voter had not casted a ballot in two consecutive elections. Then last year, Roberts authored a, yes, 5-4 decision – Common Cause v Rucho – which slammed the federal courthouses closed to partisan gerrymandering claims at precisely the time a growing number of decisions, by judges appointed by presidents of both parties, saw both an urgent role for the courts and a clear standard for when politicized mapmaking crossed a constitutional boundary.    Elected Republican officials have proven that they are willing to see Americans die rather than hold fair elections    Gerrymandering and voter purges were at the heart of the GOP urgency to hold this election, this week, with this diminished turnout. A critical state supreme court seat was on the ballot. The winner could sway an upcoming appeal over whether Wisconsin can purge about 240,000 voters from its rolls ahead of November – keep in mind, Trump only won this state by 22,000 votes in 2016 – and could also determine whether Republicans, once again, have a free hand to gerrymander the state’s legislative and congressional maps in 2021. The maps the party carefully engineered in 2011, behind closed doors at a Madison law firm, delivered a 63-36 Republican edge among state assembly districts in 2018, even though Democrats won nearly 54% of the statewide vote, and a statewide edge of about 200,000 votes. Non-partisan electoral reformers, Democratic congressional leadership, and even some apostate Republicans like Bill Kristol and the former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele have been battling to ensure that November’s election doesn’t look like the one this week in Wisconsin. After all, even if Congress does nothing to create a national vote-by-mail standard, there’s still likely to be record demand for absentee ballots this fall. And just as the underfunded election administrators and US Postal Service were overwhelmed by an unprecedented 1.2m requests in Wisconsin, it’s easy to imagine a creaky system collapsing under similar strains in November.   Related: Wisconsin's primary subjected people of color to yet another Covid-19 disadvantage | David Bowen    The Republican strategy is clear: drag their feet so it’s difficult to properly fund vote-by-mail. Mislead the public with fictional claims of voter fraud that get amplified on Fox News and by Russian bots on Twitter. Finally, count on John Roberts and the court’s partisan 5-4 majority to backstop any efforts to make free, fair and safe voting more difficult. If this plays out according to the Republican plan, it will plunge this nation from an unprecedented public health crisis into a dark constitutional emergency that threatens the legitimacy of the White House, the courts and American democracy itself. That’s a frightening sentence to write. But it’s long past time we call this what it is: elected Republican officials, and the conservatives who they have handed lifelong tenure on the federal bench, have now proven that they are willing to see Americans die rather than hold fair elections that might oust them from power. They have used a pandemic to suppress votes. The warning sirens are real. The dress rehearsal is over. There are barely 200 days until election day.

48,health,‘Social recession’: how isolation can affect physical and mental health,"As the Covid-19 pandemic continues, millions of people in the US are coming to terms with being increasingly cut off from society. Beyond the inconvenience of working from home, or not being able to go to bars, restaurants or cinemas, however, experts have found that social isolation can have a profound effect on people’s physical, as well as mental health. Long-term, isolation even increases the risk of premature death. It’s being called a “social recession” to match any economic downturn also caused by the growing pandemic and it can have profound physical and psychological effects. “People who are more socially connected show less inflammation, conversely people who are more isolated and lonely show increased chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation has been implicated in a variety of chronic diseases,” said Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Brigham Young University. “We also have evidence that this is linked to cardiovascular function like blood pressure, heart rate, circulating stress hormones. It’s been linked to even cellular ageing.” Bars and restaurants have been ordered closed in at least 11 states, including California, Illinois and New York, while more than 30 states have closed down schools. On Monday people in six counties in northern California were ordered to stay at home, one of the strictest measures yet in the US. France had imposed a lockdown which only allows people to make trips to supermarkets, pharmacies and their workplaces – should working from home not be an option, while Germany has closed places of worship, playgrounds and non-essential shops. As countries across the globe hunker down, Holt-Lunstad’s research presents a stark look at what social isolation over a period of years can do to the body. She examined data from across the globe to study the effects of people being socially isolated or lonely, or living alone.    Loneliness increases earlier death by 26%, social isolation by 29% and living alone by 32%  Julianne Holt-Lunstad     “Each of these significantly predict risk for premature death,” Holt-Lunstad said. “Loneliness increases earlier death by 26%, social isolation by 29% and living alone by 32%.” Holt-Lunstad didn’t find that one cause of death was more prevalent than another. The risk of every cause of death – including heart disease, cancer, stroke, renal failure – increased from isolation. A period of a few weeks in isolation should not lead to the inflammation and risk of cardiovascular trouble that Holt-Lunstad described. People could still see an impact on their health, however. “We do have evidence that these [periods of shorter isolation] can have immediate and short-term kinds of effects on our physiology. But, for instance, if your blood pressure is elevated acutely, that’s going to have a different kind of an effect than if your blood pressure’s elevated chronically,” Holt-Lunstad said. “For those with underlying pre-existing conditions, those acute elevations might precipitate some sort of acute event. But for most of the rest of us, who may not have some kind of underlying condition, we hope that this would just be acute and wouldn’t have these long-term effects.” One of the reasons people can suffer in social isolation is because personal relationships can help us cope with stress, Holt-Linstad said. “For instance: the ongoing uncertainty of what’s going on right now in the world, your body’s response to that may differ. Depending on the extent to which you feel like you have the resources you need to cope with that. And that in large part may be dependent on whether or not you feel like you have others in your life you can rely on. That you’ve got someone who has your back or you can count on, or you can get through it together.” Dhruv Khullar, a physician and researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, said short periods of isolation can cause increase anxiety or depression “within days”. “We have evolved to be social creatures. For all the history of humanity, people have been in family structures, people have been in groups, we’re evolved to kind of crave and rely on that interaction with other human beings,” Khullar said. “So when we don’t have that it’s a huge void in the way that we go about being human. This is something that has been kind of hard-wired into who we are as beings.” Khullar, who stressed the crackdown on social gatherings was necessary, said people do at least have a wealth of options to stay connected. Texting, video calling or even the phone could potentially help avert the sense of isolation or loneliness, Khullar said. “Tech isn’t a perfect substitute. Physical contact, being face to face with people, there’s all sorts of subtle social cues that we pick up on that we rely on, that are ingrained in us over generations and millennia,” he said. “But I do think you can get part of the way there by engaging with others digitally. I think the richer the format, probably the better – so a phone call is better than a text, a video conference is probably better than a phone call.” Older people, who are more at risk of Covid-19, may be less technologically savvy, and may have fewer connections to begin with. They might not be able to video conference or even send a text message. Khullar said it was important to reassure them that help is at hand. “Let’s look out for the people that are most vulnerable,” Khullar said. “Make sure that you’re reaching out to them to make sure that they’re doing OK, that they understand that there are people still looking out for them that they’re bonded with, that they’re connected with.”"
49,health,Australian state governments declare public health emergencies to contain coronavirus,"Scott Morrison has moved to clarify new self-isolation requirements on international arrivals to stop the spread of coronavirus as state and territory governments declare public health emergencies to enact controls and penalties on people who fail to self-isolate or cancel mass gatherings. 
The prime minister and the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, have also flagged possible further restrictions on access to aged care centres and enclosed gatherings, with meetings of chief health officers on Monday and the national cabinet on Tuesday set to decide whether to further escalate Australia’s response. 
On Sunday the national cabinet decided that all international arrivals will have to self-isolate for a period of 14 days or face penalties including fines. Social distancing is now recommended for others, such as refusing handshakes and maintain a gap of 1.5 metres from other people.

In a round of interviews spruiking the new measures on Monday, Morrison clarified that the families of people arriving from overseas would not be required to self-isolate because they were a “low-risk” group. 
On Monday Andrews declared a public emergency in Victoria and, in the Australian Capital Territory, where the second case of Covid-19 was confirmed, the chief minister, Andrew Barr, announced the ACT would declare a public health emergency later in the morning. 
Andrews told reporters in Melbourne that the Victorian declaration would last for four weeks but would probably be extended, and announced it was now an offence under the Public Health and Wellbeing Act to fail to comply with self-isolation orders. 
“Those orders relate to the mandatory … home quarantine or at a hotel if you are not a resident,” he said. “That is a proportionate and appropriate response.” 
Andrews said he did not anticipate having to fine people for failure to cancel mass gatherings of 500 people or more because “to this point, people have been cooperative”. 
He said chief medical officers “are meeting today, tomorrow and throughout the week to provide further specific advice about specific settings like aged care and smaller gatherings”. 
 
  
  
   
    Who needs to isolate?
    
    The Australian government announced new travel restrictions to try to slow the spread of coronavirus on 15 March. From midnight, all returning Australians and overseas visitors are required to isolate themselves for 14 days after arriving in the country.
    People who have been in close contact with somebody diagnosed coronavirus are already required to self-isolate.
    
    What does self-isolation mean?
    
    Self-isolation starts when you arrive in Australia, with the federal department of health recommending you use personal transport, such as a car, to travel home or to your hotel from the airport, to minimise exposure to others.
    &nbsp;“If you need to use public transport (e.g. taxis, ride-hail services, trains, buses and trams), follow the precautions outlined in the public transport guide.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;“During the 14 days of isolation, you must stay at home or in your hotel and don’t go to public places including work, school, childcare, university or public gatherings. Only people who usually live with you should be in the home. Do not see visitors.”
    &nbsp;“Ask others who are not in isolation to get food and necessities for you. If you must leave home, such as to seek medical care, wear a surgical mask. If you don’t have a mask, take care to not cough or sneeze on others.”
    &nbsp;“If you live in a private house, it is safe for you to go into your garden or courtyard. If you live in an apartment or are staying in a hotel, it is also safe for you to go into the garden but you should wear a surgical mask to minimise risk to others and move quickly through any common areas.”
    
    What if I feel sick?
    
    The health department recommends monitoring yourself for symptoms including “fever, cough or shortness of breath. Other early symptoms include chills, body aches, sore throat, runny nose and muscle pain.”
    &nbsp;“If you develop symptoms (fever, a cough, sore throat, tiredness or shortness of breath) within 14 days of returning to Australia or within 14 days of last contact of a confirmed case, you should arrange to see your doctor for urgent assessment. You should telephone the health clinic or hospital before you arrive and tell them your travel history or that you may have been in contact with a potential case of coronavirus.”
    
    Limiting the spread at home
    
    The health department recommends practising good hand and sneeze/cough hygiene as the best defence against most viruses.
    &nbsp;It also advises regular cleaning of household surfaces.
    &nbsp;“To minimise the spread of any germs you should regularly wash surfaces that are frequently touched such as door handles, light switches, kitchen and bathroom areas. Clean with household detergent or disinfectant.

New South Wales has already issued an order under the Public Health Act to force the immediate cancellation of major events with more than 500 people. Individuals who fail to comply could face up to six months in prison or a fine of up to $11,000, or both. 
The Queensland health minister, Steven Miles, confirmed on Radio National that new laws passed in February would allow the state to impose compulsory self-isolation on people arriving from overseas, with penalties to include detention and fines if they failed to comply. 
In an address to the nation on Sunday evening, the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, offered the government “a spirit of bipartisanship” and promised to be “constructive” in response. 
But Albanese continued to push the government to go further in providing “more consistent advice” on when to self-isolate and get tested, to fast-track new fever clinics planned under the $2.4bn health response, and to provide more support for casual workers and independent contractors to take leave. “There is now no room for delays,” he said. 
On Monday, Morrison defended his government’s speed in responding to coronavirus, after Guardian Australia revealed it did not commission a national public health campaign until 3 March, just a week before the $30m campaign was announced and more than a month after Australia’s first case was confirmed on 25 January. 
Morrison told ABC AM that resources had been set aside for the campaign “several weeks ago” and the government had taken coronavirus seriously since mid-January, responding with travel bans and evacuations from Wuhan and Japan. 
Explaining the new requirement for international arrivals, Morrison said people would be issued with personal protective equipment to wear on their journey home, where they would need to self-isolate for 14 days. But their families would not need to self-isolate because they were a “low risk group”, he said. 
Morrison praised Woolworths for instituting a dedicated hour of shopping for vulnerable groups, namely elderly people and those with disabilities. He blamed panic buying on “misinformation on social media” and people “listening to opinions on their health” sourced from Twitter rather than the chief medical officers. 
On Sky, Morrison flagged the next stage of restrictions would probably include controls on visiting aged care centres and gatherings in enclosed spaces. 
“When you have elderly relatives in nursing homes you obviously want to see them – it might be the last time you get to see them,” he said. “That needs to be done sensitively ... We need to lessen the broader risk for people in these facilities.” 
Morrison confirmed that the widespread closure of schools was not recommended, although “specific instances” of outbreaks in specific schools had attracted closures in NSW and Victoria. 
Morrison confirmed he has not been tested for coronavirus, citing the fact he does not have symptoms.

After the announcement on Thursday of a $17.6bn stimulus package to counteract the economic impact of coronavirus, there are signs that further government assistance will be required for affected industries. 
On Sunday Labor’s shadow infrastructure minister, Catherine King, called for assistance to address the “significant consequences” for the aviation sector caused by travel bans and self-isolation requirements. 
Asked about possible government support for the major carriers Qantas and Virgin, the foreign minister, Marise Payne, told Radio National: “Yes … as this progresses, I’m sure there will be other matters which need to be considered, maybe the ones you have raised.” 
Payne also noted that major sporting events including the Australian Football League, National Rugby League and racing have been disrupted and the government “will be asked to consider those”."
50,health,"Reveal cost of 3.5m unusable Covid-19 tests, health chiefs told","Senior health officials are facing demands to reveal how much has been spent on millions of inaccurate coronavirus antibody tests, after it emerged that payments had been guaranteed even if the kits failed to work. Public Health England is also being asked to disclose which companies the tests came from and why payment was not made contingent on the tests proving accurate. A formal request for the details is being made in a letter by Greg Clark, the former Conservative cabinet minister and chair of the Commons science and technology committee. Britain ordered at least 3.5 million of the antibody home-testing kits, which are designed to detect whether someone has had coronavirus. The UK government talked up the potential of the tests last month, with Boris Johnson heralding them as a “game-changer” that could give individuals a “green light” to go back to work. Health chiefs said kits could be made available through Amazon and Boots once they had been proved to work. However, all the versions of the tests proved to be too inaccurate to be used. Scientists have discovered that although the tests can show that a person has been infected with a coronavirus, they cannot adequately differentiate between the virus that is causing the current Covid-19 outbreak and other types of coronavirus –which just cause colds. They found that a range of devices all produced far too many false positives.       “It does seem surprising that these tests were bought with a contract that wasn’t contingent on their usability,” Clark told the Observer. “In learning lessons through this crisis, it’s important for future contracts to recognise this risk.” Kathy Hall, director of Covid-19 testing strategy at the Department for Health and Social Care, revealed last week that the government was working to recoup money paid for the tests “where possible”. Asked whether payment was made on the assumption that the devices worked, she said: “Our overall strategy was to secure tests in order to get them validated. That meant ordering minimum volumes in order to secure them. And we wanted to make sure we had the opportunity to do that, so that was the strategy we took, yes.” Antibody tests are considered to be vital to moving out of the lockdown caused by Covid-19. They will show whether people have or have not been infected with the the Sars-Cov-2 virus. Health workers found to have antibodies would no longer have to worryabout being infected or infectious every time they display symptoms similar to those of Covid-19, for example. In addition, antibody tests will give scientists a far clearer picture of how far the Sars-Cov-2 virus has affected the British population, said of Cambridge University’s biostatistics unit. “Knowing how many of us have been exposed to the virus is important for calculating accurately the death rate of this virus among all who were infected. As importantly, the proportion of the population who still have antibodies and – we hope – immunity, has implications for what the future of the epidemic might look like.”     A deserted street in Gangelt in Germany, where 14% of the population were found to have antibodies for the disease. Photograph: Sascha Steinbach/EPA    The importance of this approach was highlighted last week by a study by the University of Bonn. Researchers there tested a randomised sample of 1,000 residents of Gangelt, a town near the Dutch border that had suffered a major outbreak of Covid-19. They found that 2% of the population was currently infected and 14% were carrying antibodies, which suggested that they had already been infected, although many had displayed no symptoms. If correct, these figures suggest that if many more people have been infected than was expected, the overall death rate - at least in Germany - from the Sars-Cov-2 virus could be very low. One estimate suggested it would be as low as 0.2%. These figures have been welcomed, albeit with caution, by scientists in the UK. Professor Keith Neal of Nottingham University, described the study as “good news”, because it suggested that significant numbers of people had developed antibodies and the overall mortality rate could be lower than current estimates. “The findings are dependent on the quality of the antibody test used, however, and it is important that similar antibody studies are done elsewhere and that results of the antibody tests from Porton Down lab in the UK are reported regularly without delay.”"
51,health,Mental health care postcode lottery ‘is risking lives’,"People with mental health problems are being forced to wait 112 days for treatment through the NHS’s talking therapies programme – despite a supposed six-week maximum wait. Delays in care facing those with anxiety and depression are so long in some parts of England that they could lead to people taking their own life, a leading expert in mental health has warned. An Observer analysis of waiting time data from the NHS’s Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme has revealed a huge postcode lottery in the average time it took people referred by their GP both to be assessed and then to start treatment in 2018-19. In some places, a first appointment, at which patients are assessed, takes an average of just four days but in others it takes 55. Similarly, the average wait between the first appointment and the second – at which treatment starts – varies between 13 and 112 days. An NHS-wide target requires clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) to ensure 75% of those referred are seen within six weeks and 95% within 18 weeks. Health service bosses admit privately that, while waiting times are being met nationally, some areas are a long way from delivering, mainly due to shortages of the therapists who provide most of the care. “Since they were introduced 10 years ago, IAPT services have dramatically increased the numbers of people getting access to mental health support. But services are clearly struggling to cope with demand,” said Paul Farmer, the chief executive of the mental health charity Mind and ex-chair of the government’s taskforce on mental health. “No one should have to wait three months between their assessment and starting treatment, and how long you wait shouldn’t depend on where you live. Not getting the right support can be life-threatening.”     Paul Farmer chief executive of Mind. Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian    Four CCGs manage to provide assessments within four days: Wakefield, Castle Point and Rochford, Basildon and Brentwood, and South East Staffordshire and Seisdon Peninsula. However, the same wait is 55 days in Salford, 51 days in East and North Hertfordshire and 49 days in West Cheshire. Patients in Eastern Cheshire face the longest average waits to start treatment – 112 days – our analysis found. Delays are almost as long in Barnet in London (95 days), while they are 85, 82 and 81 days respectively in West Essex, Milton Keynes and Bexley, also in the capital. The IAPT programme, introduced by Labour in 2009, is widely admired for helping with common mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, panic attacks, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. NHS England has hailed its success in increasing the numbers referred to it to 1.6 million in 2018-19, although only 1.1 million people started treatment and only 582,556 finished their course of treatment, usually cognitive behavioural therapy. Dr Tim Rogers, a consultant psychiatrist and clinical director of the digital service Big White Wall, which universities and the Ministry of Defence use to provide mental health support online to students and members of the armed forces, said the growing numbers of people seeking help was a positive trend “but it also creates huge challenges in terms of access to and provision of treatment and support. “It’s clear from these striking data that the scale of this task facing the country means that innovative solutions, including the use of technology, are the way forward.” Users of Big White Wall’s digital services are less likely to end up in a crisis, use GP and A&amp;E services less and often recover without needing to access IAPT treatment at all, he added. A spokesperson for the NHS said: “Nowhere in the world has a more successful programme [than IAPT] for helping people with depression and anxiety. IAPT is seeing 100,000 people every month entering treatment, with nine in 10 starting treatment within six weeks after an initial discussion with a therapist about their condition. “With more than half of people recovering from their mental illness as a result of NHS talking therapies, it is right that countries including Canada, Australia, the US, Norway and Israel are adopting this model for their own patients.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

After facing weeks of calls to release the evidence it is using to justify sweeping restrictions on social and economic life, the government published material on Tuesday that is based on the impact of strategies that have been rolled out around the world – but not Australian case numbers. 
If there were an unchecked outbreak in Australia, the modelling suggests, some 35,000 intensive care beds could be required at its peak – something that would be well beyond the country’s capacity to provide.

But the modelling also suggests that with isolation and quarantine measures in place, ICU demand drops to 17,000 at the peak of an outbreak. When these measures are combined with physical distancing, the peak demand may drop below 5,000. 
On the eve of the resumption of parliament for a special one-day sitting, the government said the work was “highly theoretical” and experts would require another few weeks to prepare further modelling based on Australian case numbers.

But Scott Morrison said the existing restrictions were helping to “flatten the curve” and “buying time” so that governments across the country could decide the best options for Australia in the months ahead. 
The prime minister said part of the country’s “modest success to date” meant that the number of cases of community transmission – fewer than 1 in 10 confirmed cases – was still quite low, which did not present a very big case base for more detailed Australian modelling. 
“For now, and certainly over the weeks ahead, though, the lesson is simple, and that is that we must continue to do what we are doing – that is how we get through this,” Morrison said. 
“We have bought valuable time, but we cannot be complacent. We must keep the tension in the cord. This Easter weekend will be incredibly important. Stay at home. Failure to do so this weekend would completely undo everything we have achieved so far together, and potentially worse.” 
The Doherty Institute – which prepared the modelling work for the Department of Health – briefed journalists via videoconference later on Tuesday.

James McCaw, a professor of mathematical biology and infectious diseases epidemiologist at the University of Melbourne, said the team had started new work “in the last few days” to provide Australian governments with short-term outlooks on transmission, future load on the health system, and potential responses. 
He likened it to pivoting from long-term climate outlooks to daily weather forecasts. How that would be released to the public would be up to the government. 
The modelling was released after the latest meeting of the national cabinet of state and territory leaders. 
The leaders agreed to a mandatory code of conduct to govern the renegotiation of commercial leases, but Morrison said residential tenancies would be dealt with separately by each state and territory, with no baselines beyond the six-month moratorium on evictions. 
The code governs leases for tenants with an annual turnover of $50m or less that also meet the threshold for jobkeeper payments, a reduction in turnover of at least 30%. 
Commercial landlords and distressed tenants will negotiate rent reductions in proportion to the decline in the tenant’s turnover through a combination of deferral and waivers of rent, overseen by binding mediation. 
Waivers of rent must account for 50%, at least, of the reduction in the rental provided to the tenant during that period, Morrison said. Deferred rent can be paid back over the remaining lease period, or at least 24 months. 
Despite signs that national cabinet was moving towards a system of using land tax reductions to encourage residential landlords to offer rent reductions, Morrison said residential tenancies will “now be dealt with directly by each of the state and territory jurisdictions”. 
The Australian Capital Territory has already announced a six-month scheme offering waivers of land tax capped at $1,300 a quarter, with the government to share rent reductions 50/50 with landlords.

On Tuesday, Labor’s shadow housing minister, Jason Clare, praised the ACT plan as “a pretty smart idea” and “a great incentive for landlords and tenants to sit down and to work a way through this”. Similar proposals are in development in other states, although some favour a less generous three-month period of land tax waivers. 
On Tuesday, the industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, released final draft legislation of the government’s $130bn jobkeeper legislation, to be debated on Wednesday and passed with Labor support. 
Under the legislation, employers claiming the $1,500 fortnightly payment on behalf of employees would be allowed to activate a “jobkeeper enabling stand-down” and alter their employees’ hours of work if they can’t be usefully employed at their full hours as a result of Covid-19. 
Employers will be able to alter the usual duties and location of employees’ work, provided it is safe, reasonable, inside the employee’s competency and the employer’s usual scope of work. 
Employers and employees can agree to vary the days worked, and agree to expend leave entitlements until just two weeks of annual leave remain, while the employer claims jobkeeper and pays it on to the employee. This must be by agreement, but an employee cannot “unreasonably refuse”. 
All three measures will be overseen by the Fair Work Commission, after negotiations of safeguards with the Australian Council of Trade Unions."
53,health,Coronavirus: health experts fear epidemic will ‘let rip’ through UK,"Public health experts and hundreds of doctors and scientists at home and abroad are urging the UK government to change its strategy against coronavirus, amid fears it will mean the epidemic “lets rip” through the population. 
They say the UK is turning its back on strategies that have successfully brought down the numbers of infections and deaths in other countries. 
On Thursday, Boris Johnson and his medical and scientific advisers announced that only those seriously ill in hospital would be tested. Anyone who had any symptoms should self-isolate at home for seven days, without notifying the NHS. 
Banning mass gatherings would not help reduce the spread of infections, the prime minister and his advisers said – although it now seems likely, largely in response to sporting and entertainment bodies cancelling events of their own accord.

Anthony Costello, a UK paediatrician and former director of the World Health Organization (WHO), said he had personally written to the chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, asking for testing to continue in the community. 
“The key principles from WHO are intensive surveillance,” he told the Guardian. “You test the population like crazy, find out where the cases are, immediately quarantine them and do contact tracing and get them out of the community. This deals with family clusters. That’s the key bedrock of getting this under control.”

This was how South Korea, China, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan had brought their case numbers down. “You can really take people out of the population and make sure they are quarantined. That is vital – before you get to social distancing.” 
Yet the UK government was stopping tests outside of hospital. “For me and the WHO people I have spoken to, this is absolutely the wrong policy. It would mean it just lets rip,” he said. 
Costello thinks we will be in the same position as Italy within two weeks. “The basic public health approach is playing second fiddle to mathematical modelling,” he said. 
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO’s director general, expressed his deep concern on Friday at the end of testing and contact tracing in the UK and some other European countries. 
“You can’t fight a virus if you don’t know where it is,” he said. “Find, isolate, test and treat every case to break the chains of Covid transmission. Every case we find and treat limits the expansion of the disease.” 
Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at The University of Edinburgh, listed on Twitter the reasons for continuing to test. “1 People can alter behaviour based on whether they have Covid. 2 Break chains of transmission. 3 Local hospitals can plan for how many patients will need care. 4 To know where cases are emerging (hotspots). 5 How do we know how large problem is?” 
A government minister in Singapore has also expressed dismay. “One concern we have with cases such as UK and Switzerland isn’t just about the numbers. It is that these countries have abandoned any measure to contain or restrain the virus,” minister for national development, Lawrence Wong, said at a press briefing on Sunday. “If there’s no attempt to contain, we estimate the number of cases in these countries to rise significantly in the coming days and weeks.” 
An open letter from a group including some of the UK’s most senior doctors asked the government to publish the modelling and any other evidence for the policies it is pursuing. “Our country’s public health response to Covid-19 is demonstrably different to most other countries’ responses globally and in Europe … There is also no clear indication that the UK’s response is being informed by experiences of other countries in containing the spread of Covid-19,” it said, pointing out the risks to the NHS of a rapid and huge surge in cases of people needing hospital treatment. The UK has 2.5 beds per 1,000 people in the population, they said, which is fewer than France (6), Italy (3.2) and the United States (2.8).

Immunologists, in a separate open letter, said they had “significant questions” about the government’s apparent strategy to rely on building up “herd immunity” by exposure to the virus in the UK. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, has suggested this might be a good outcome from many people becoming infected. 
Herd immunity is usually brought about by vaccination – not exposing people to the risks of a disease. “The ultimate aim of herd immunity is to stop disease spread and protect the most vulnerable in society. However, this strategy only works to reduce serious disease if, when building that immunity, vulnerable individuals are protected from becoming ill, for example through social distancing. If not, the consequences could be severe,” says the letter from the British Society for Immunology. 
Behavioural scientists joined the concern, saying they believed the government should immediately bring in social distancing measures and not delay for fear of the public getting “behavioural fatigue”. 
“If ‘behavioural fatigue’ truly represents a key factor in the government’s decision to delay high-visibility interventions, we urge the government to share an adequate evidence base in support of that decision. If one is lacking, we urge the government to reconsider these decisions,” wrote Prof Ulrike Hahn from Birkbeck, University of London, and others."
54,health,Global leaders urge G20 to tackle twin health and economic crises,"A group of 165 global leaders has called for immediate and coordinated international action to tackle the twin health and economic emergencies caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Past and present politicians – including three former UK prime ministers – joined academics and civil society representatives to warn the G20 that the virus will return unless urgent action is taken to bolster health systems in poor countries of Africa and Latin America. Amid concerns that the fight against Covid-19 is being hampered by a lack of united action by the body that represents leading developed and developing nations, the global leaders said $8bn (£6.4bn) of emergency health funding should be approved to prevent a second wave of infection. A letter from the group urged the G20 to set up a taskforce with executive powers to help coordinate the fight against Covid-19. It called for debt relief for the poorest countries and an increase in the funds available to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. “We are writing to call for immediate internationally coordinated action – within the next few days – to address our deepening global health and economic crises from Covid-19” the letter says. It adds: “In 2008-10, the immediate economic crisis could be surmounted when the economic fault line – under-capitalisation of the global banking system – was tackled. Now, however, the economic emergency will not be resolved until the health emergency is effectively addressed: the health emergency will not end simply by conquering the disease in one country alone, but by ensuring recovery from Covid-19 in all countries.” The letter was signed by, among others, Gordon Brown, Tony Blair and John Major, the former president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, the former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, the former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, the former UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon, financier George Soros and the nobel prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz. The letter said that in addition to the $8bn of emergency health spending, developing countries would need $150bn to fight the twin medical and economic challenges. Both the IMF and the World Bank have been urging creditor countries to defer interest payments on bilateral poor-country debt this year, saving them $14bn, but the group of 165 leaders said the international community should go further and agree a more generous package, worth $44bn to Africa alone. The IMF and the World Bank will hold spring meetings by teleconference, with finance ministers discussing plans to beef up the financial resources of the two Washington-based organisations. The letter to the G20 said the IMF needed an additional $500-600bn in the form of special drawing rights: a form of international currency that can be used to increase the reserves of member states. Extra funds would also be needed to help the World Bank meet demands for help.     Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk   Citing research by Imperial College London, the letter said 1.2 million Covid-19 deaths were possible in Africa and Asia’s poorest countries. It said even the best funded health systems were struggling to cope with the pandemic. “Yet, if we do nothing as the disease spreads in poorer African, Asian and Latin American cities and in fragile communities which have little testing equipment, ventilators and medical supplies; and where social distancing and even washing hands are difficult to achieve, Covid-19 will persist there and re-emerge to hit the rest of the world with further rounds that will prolong the crisis.” It added: “Much has been done by national governments to counter the downward slide of their economies. But a global economic problem requires a global economic response.”"
55,health,"Anxiety on rise due to coronavirus, say mental health charities","The coronavirus epidemic is causing increased stress and anxiety, , particularly people with existing mental health problems, practitioners and campaigners have said. 
Reactions to the crisis can include feeling overwhelmed, fearful, sad, angry and helpless, according to experts. Some people may have difficulty sleeping or concentrating. Fear of contact with others, travelling on public transport or going into public spaces may increase, and some people will have physical symptoms, such as an increased heart rate or upset stomach. 
The World Health Organization has acknowledged that the crisis is generating stress, and has advised people to avoid watching, reading or listening to news that causes feelings of anxiety or distress. 
Stephen Buckley, of the mental health charity Mind, said: “We know that the coronavirus and its impact are causing stress and worry for many people. If you already have a mental health problem, it’s possible that the worries of coronavirus may be affecting how you’re coping.” 
 
  
  
   
    
    The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.
    The UN agency&nbsp;advises&nbsp;people to:
    
     Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap
     Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing
     Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough
     Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers
     Advice about face masks varies. Wearing them while out and about may offer some protection against both spreading and catching the virus via coughs and sneezes, but it is not a cast-iron guarantee of protection
    
    Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.&nbsp;
    In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;stay at home for at least 7 days.
    If you live with other people,&nbsp;they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.
    
   
  
  
 
Quarantine or self-isolation is likely to have a negative impact on mental wellbeing. A review of the psychological impact of quarantine published in the Lancet in February said: “Separation from loved ones, the loss of freedom, uncertainty over disease status, and boredom can, on occasion, create dramatic effects. Suicide has been reported, substantial anger generated, and lawsuits brought following the imposition of quarantine in previous outbreaks. 
“The potential benefits of mandatory mass quarantine need to be weighed carefully against the possible psychological costs.” 
According to Kathryn Kinmond, a psychotherapist in Staffordshire and a member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, uncertainty is a key driver of anxiety. “Coronavirus gives rise to lots of uncertainty, and this has particular resonance with people who suffer from anxiety.” Clients were “inevitably” raising concerns about the coronavirus in therapy sessions, she said. 
Ashley Fulwood, of OCD UK, said the charity had received an increase in calls and emails from people with obsessive compulsive disorder who were developing a new fixation on the coronavirus. 
Around a quarter of people with OCD experience compulsive cleaning, such as handwashing over a fear of contamination, according to Fulwood. 
“I’m seeing for some of those people their OCD is intensifying, there is lots of avoidance going on and lots more washing than is recommended by the government – for some people their OCD is being triggered to the point where they’re washing for 20 minutes or longer,” he said. 
Emily Burke, an 18-year-old student in Hertfordshire, has had OCD for four years and said she was finding the extensive media coverage and social media posts difficult to deal with. 
“I’ve worked hard on it and I don’t wash my hands as much as I used to, so it’s really triggering. It’s not even like I can just turn off social media because it’s everywhere, everyone is saying: ‘Have you washed your hands?’” she said.

Panic attacks may also be a response to the coronavirus outbreak, according to David Crepaz-Keay, of the Mental Health Foundation. 
“One of the things that leads to panic attacks is excessive worrying for unsubstantiated reasons,” he said. “There are a relatively small number of people in this country affected by coronavirus … We shouldn’t allow that anxiety to cause us more problems than it warrants at the moment.” 
Tom Kinniburgh, a 33-year-old game designer in London, started experiencing panic attacks after a number of fellow travellers began feeling ill on their return flight from a skiing trip in Val d’Isere, near northern Italy. 
“I started feeling a bit ill and then I’d see news articles or reports about the virus spreading and self-isolation, and I’d get this huge wave of fear,” he said. “It felt like it made me have a cough, and then it sort of settled in my stomach and made my heart palpitate and essentially made me not be able to breathe.” 
He said he started to worry he had contracted the virus, but the symptoms quickly disappeared and after talking to a friend who is a doctor, he realised he was experiencing panic attacks. 
“They lasted up to 30 minutes, and they were really quite debilitating, with real shortness of breath, tingling and loss of eyesight in some regard.”  
Sarah, from Gateshead, who did not want her surname published, said she had increased her dosage of anti-anxiety medication. 
“Some of the things that politicians say, and also then some of the reporting of it … can create that initial anxiety response,” she said.

Rosie Weatherley of Mind said mental health services were making plans to provide continued treatment in the case of restrictions on movement and the closure of workplaces. 
“A lot of people are reliant on interaction with therapists, but some of that can be done by phone or online. People with mental health issues need to ensure their medication supplies are sufficient for any periods of self-isolation,” she said. 
Mind’s advice to people who have behavioural problems about hygiene includes avoiding repeatedly reading the same advice, asking other people not to keep reminding them to wash their hands, setting time limits on handwashing, and using breathing exercises."

After the share market fell 7.4% on Monday, 3.5% on Wednesday, and more than 5% on Thursday you could be excused for thinking everything is buggered. 
Do we need perspective? The market is around 23% below the peak of the past 12 months, which is much less a fall than in the October 1987 crash, and also the global financial crisis. In both cases the stock market lost about half of its value.

A 2006 Treasury department paper on “The macroeconomic effect of an influenza pandemic”, coincidentally co-authored by the current Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, concludes that “GDP could contract by over 5% over the first year following an outbreak of a highly contagious pandemic”. 
But such a study did not consider that the world’s biggest economy is run by a megalomaniac with an aversion to reality. Consider that Trump gave a national TV address in which he stated at least three errors, all of which sent the US markets into their biggest fall for 33 years. 
The lack of any international co-ordination is damning – no urgent meeting of the G20, not even a phone hook-up. 
Trump has made the world more insular, at the very moment it needs to be the opposite. 
And what about our government’s response? 
It has been less than stellar. 
The lack of a public information campaign is damning. Where are the health advice ads playing on TV? They haven’t been able to even get a cheap YouTube ad up to share on social media. 
Should you get tested? How do you get tested? When should you stay home? 
We should all know the advice by rote.

The economic stimulus, I think, also contains far too little on the health side. 
During the GFC we needed to get people spending; now we first need to ensure it is safe for people to go out to spend. 
An absolute priority must be to ensure people who are sick stay home. I would have considered providing casual workers with at least access to a 14-day government-paid sick leave equal to the minimum wage for coronavirus symptoms. 
In such cases you need to go big to break through the noise. Nothing in the government’s announcement had you thinking “cripes, they aren’t holding back”. Mostly the reaction was instead was that more is needed. 
The level of resources being put towards urgent and rapid testing should be jaw-dropping. 
Instead, we had Morrison being grossly casual telling Alan Jones he is going to the footy and that “it’s important for our economy and just our general wellbeing ... that people sort of get on about their lives”. 
At the same time the head of the AMA in Western Australia tweeted: “You want to go to the footy? I want my colleagues to stay alive. Cancel crowds at events. Close the schools soon.” 
Later chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, advised that Coag recommended gatherings of more than 500 people be cancelled (though not actually banned). Oddly that advice only comes into effect from Monday. I guess the virus gets the weekend off ... 
Morrison’s TV address contained little health advice except “please visit health.gov.au or talk to your local GP” (because yes, GPs have so much time on their hands). He did not even address panic buying. 
The $750 cash payment for government benefit cardholders also seems rather weak. 
In 2008 the Rudd government’s first cash stimulus was $1,000 to $1,400 for pensioners and low-income households. It was followed up with $900 to households earning up to $80,000. 
In 2008, $1,000 was worth 77% of average male weekly full-time earnings; $750 is just 40% of the current average of $1,840. 
Crucially, the GFC payments did not have to account for people overspending while stocking up on supplies. 
You would be smart to bet that the May budget will contain more than has been announced this week. I suspect we will need something even before then.

57,health,Health experts question coronavirus quarantine measures on cruise ship,"Quarantine conditions imposed on a stricken ship in Japan are both morally dubious and appear counterproductive, according to health experts who fear the vessel has become an incubator for the coronavirus Covid-19. Thousands of people have spent the past two weeks stuck onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which now accounts for the biggest cluster of cases outside mainland China. More than 540 passengers in the Japanese port Yokohama are confirmed to have the virus, after 88 additional cases were confirmed on Tuesday. Experts are still trying to understand how easily the virus transmits, but there are fears that the conditions on the ship – quarantined after a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong tested positive – have allowed the disease to spread more rapidly.Roojin Habibi, a lawyer specialising in global health law, said the quarantine measure was an experiment carried out in real-time, and that it had turned the ship into “a boiling pot of transmission”. On Tuesday morning, the UK government, which has come under increased pressure to intervene, said that it was working to organise an evacuation flight for 74 British passengers. The announcement came after the US chartered a flight on Sunday and several other countries announced plans to do so. About 200 Australian passengers were expected to be evacuated on a Qantas flight on Wednesday and taken to a location on the Australian mainland where they will be isolated for two weeks. Dr Clare Wenham, an assistant professor of global health policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said the evacuation of US citizens raised broader questions about whether it was really necessary for people to remain on the ship. “The Americans are being allowed to disembark in some form to get to the airport. If that’s deemed safe, why can’t everyone else get off and be put in quarantine elsewhere?” The decision to quarantine about 3,700 crew and passengers on the vessel was morally dubious, she added. Japanese officials have defended the quarantine, and say that precautions have been taken to stop the disease from spreading on the ship. These includes providing staff with masks, encouraging handwashing and closing communal bars and restaurants. The vast majority of people who catch the virus will recover, according to the World Health Organization, which has confirmed that data from the Chinese province of Hubei, the centre of the outbreak, suggested about 2% of cases were fatal. Dr Michael Ryan, the chief of emergencies at WHO, said last week that countries should respect the human rights of travellers. “It’s really important that there’s an appropriate risk management approach being taken here,” he said. It is not clear if all passengers on the Diamond Princess will face further quarantine in their home countries. On Monday, David Abel, a passenger who has posted video diaries from the ship, spoke about the psychological impact on those affected. “It’s all getting to us now – not just me, other passengers as well. It’s the not-knowing factor that is the real challenge,” he said in a YouTube video. On Tuesday morning he said he had been told that he had tested positive, but later said he doubted the results. For the past two weeks, passengers have been mostly confined to their cabins, while staff wearing masks have delivered food to their rooms. The ship’s crew members, meanwhile, have reportedly continued to share bathrooms and eat together, which has prompted questions about the effectiveness of the quarantine measures. Mark Eccleston-Turner, a lecturer in law at Keele University specialising in global health law, said conditions on the ship were worrying and said that human rights appeared to have become “a secondary concern during this outbreak”. Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, any restrictions on civil liberties that are introduced in the name of public health must meet certain requirements to be considered lawful and legitimate, he said. Such measures should not be arbitrary or discriminatory, they must be deemed strictly necessary, the least intrusive and restrictive option available and, among other things, based on scientific evidence. While quarantines can meet these criteria, he said, the measures imposed on the ship do not appear to do so. “It is quite arbitrary in nature. Typically when you quarantine people in public health to prevent onward spread of a virus, you are quarantining people who you know have an infectious agent – people you know are unwell. The vast majority of people on this cruise ship are not infected and were not infected at the point that the quarantine began,” he said. It was disappointing, he added, that the World Health Organization had not taken are stronger stance against such policies – particularly the wide-ranging restrictions introduced in China. There are fears about the long-term impact of such policies on future outbreaks. Habibi, who is also a research fellow at the the Global Strategy Lab at York University in Canada, added: “By taking such dramatic measures, measures that are irrational and rooted in fear, we are basically dissuading the next country that has an outbreak in their borders from coming out to publicly report that fact to the world.” Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said that while the quarantine seems to have stopped passengers from transmitting infections further around the world, the high number of cases reported on board over recent days suggests that measures to stop the spread on the ship had been ineffective. “How and when these new cases acquired their infections is not currently clear so the reasons how and indeed when this transmission occurred in not yet known. The most likely route is direct person to person transmission when people are close to an infected person, but with currently publicly available information it is not possible to rule out other issues at this stage,” he said. Efforts by government to evacuate affected citizens would understandably be welcomed by those on board, he said, but he added “such repatriation is not free from risks”. “Considerable care needs to be made to ensure that the passengers do not transmit infection between themselves or to cabin crew during the flight home and once back on home soil they do not act as a focus for the spread of the disease into their home countries – any returning passengers may be put in quarantine on their return.”"
58,health,How false claims about 5G health risks spread into the mainstream,"A year ago, hoax theories about the dangers of 5G had barely pierced the public’s consciousness, largely remaining confined to serious conspiracy theorists such as David Icke. In recent weeks, baseless claims about risks associated with the next-generation mobile technology have gone mainstream. Claims linking 5G to the coronavirus pandemic have led to petrol bomb attacks on phone masts and rebuttals from the government. Industry insiders and factchecking experts point to a perfect storm of conditions that have helped the theory – described as “dangerous nonsense” – to take hold. They cite the rapid growth of neighbourhood social media groups, a failure by networks to promote scientific evidence about 5G, and a terrified population looking to make sense of a world turned upside down. The government and mobile networks have been left scrambling as the some members of the public have turned on telecoms engineers and carried out arson attacks on masts that in many cases do not yet have 5G equipment, as the rollout has been so slow. Tom Phillips, the editor of the factchecking organisation Full Fact, said it warned last summer about the growing prevalence of 5G health claims. But in recent weeks debunked claims about 5G had been transformed, potentially aided by the creation of new local Facebook and WhatsApp groups to help support neighbours during the pandemic. Google Trends data suggests British interest in 5G theories exploded in the final days of March, shortly after the lockdown was imposed. Phillips said one of the difficulties in battling the various claims was that it is hard to pin down exactly what is being suggested. “We’ve seen theories that the virus is real but 5G is making it worse, we’ve seen theories that the symptoms are not the result of the virus but purely the result of 5G, and we’ve seen theories that there are no outbreaks at all but it’s all a hoax to cover up the installation of 5G,” he said. A senior member of staff at one UK mobile network blamed the rapid spread of a map that purported to show an overlap between countries that had coronavirus cases and countries that had rolled out 5G. The map was not accurate on either measure. Other viral claims emphasised other supposed coincidences. A popular claim that Wuhan was the first city in the world to receive 5G took hold. But Wuhan received 5G coverage in August 2019, almost 18 months after O2 launched its first London testbed for the technology on the Greenwich peninsula. Iran, meanwhile, has seen an incredibly high number of coronavirus cases despite not having any 5G coverage. The International Commission on Non‐Ionizing Radiation Protection, which sets guidelines on the output of mobile masts, says there is not a single scientifically substantiated adverse health effect that can be attributed to a normal 5G installation. “We know parts of the community are concerned about the safety of 5G,” Dr Eric van Rongen, the chair of the ICNIRP, told the Guardian. “The guidelines have been developed after a thorough review of all relevant scientific literature, scientific workshops and an extensive public consultation process.” As social media interest in the topic grew, some less scrupulous news outlets latched on to it as a potential source of clicks. The press regulation campaign group Hacked Off has noted that the Daily Star published an article on 24 March – the day after Boris Johnson ordered Britons to stay inside – with the headline “Coronavirus: Fears 5G wifi networks could be acting as ‘accelerator’ for disease”. The story, labelled as an exclusive, relied entirely on quotes from non-scientists. Celebrities who often have larger audiences on Twitter and Instagram than many mainstream news outlets also boosted the theory, although some have since backed down. After the Britain’s Got Talent judge Amanda Holden was mocked for tweeting a link to a petition about the theory, her representative told media outlets that she had accidentally shared the link and did not endorse conspiracy theories. Facing pressure from the government and a showdown with ministers, Facebook announced on Monday that it would start to actively remove false claims that linked Covid-19 to 5G and could lead to physical harm. However, its policy on other scientifically unjustified claims about 5G remain unclear. Users on one of the biggest anti-5G Facebook groups in the UK mix pictures of apparently burnt-out mobile phone equipment with anti-vaccine material and baseless claims that coronavirus wards on hospitals are empty.  One prominent anti-5G group in Bristol defended itself from critics by adopting the language of those who distrust mainstream media and scientific voices, claiming that rejecting authoritative voices was the only way to find what is really going on. Direct action in the UK against telephone masts is nothing new. When 3G equipment was being installed across the country in the mid-2000s there was similar outbreaks of concern about supposed health risks, with some resorting to direct action.  A long-running protest campaign against a mobile phone mast in the North Yorkshire village of Sheriff Hutton, partly on health grounds, culminated in a mysterious incident in 2007 in which concrete was poured into the base station.  Similar claims have been made for decades about the impact of microwave ovens and home wifi connections. Yet despite warnings that public fears about 5G were growing before the pandemic, networks did little large-scale outreach work to counter the concerns. “I think as an industry we could have been quicker and clearer about what 5G is,” one network insider said. “As in, it’s basically the same as 4G in terms of how it uses mobile spectrum. We tend to get a bit bogged down on the technology and miss the wider picture.” Tom Phillips, the factchecking journalist, said it was always tough to convince people to change their minds on such topics once they had decided a theory was true. He also said people who believed the theories needed to be treated with compassion.  “It is not enough to try and stamp out the poor quality information, you do have to put good information in its place,” he said. “And as soon you try to provide information, you run the risk of becoming part of the conspiracy theory – ‘you would say that, wouldn’t you?’”"
59,health,New Zealand health minister demoted after beach visit broke lockdown rules,"New Zealand’s health minister has been demoted after he ignored national lockdown rules and drove his family to a beach 20km from his home. Last week Dr David Clark was photographed going for a mountain bike ride 2km away from his Dunedin home. He apologised for the incident, saying it showed poor judgment at a time when all New Zealanders were being urged to stay at home and only exercise in their local area. Now Clark has revealed a further indiscretion, calling himself an “idiot” for deciding to drive his family 20km to the Doctor’s Point beach on the first weekend of lockdown. Lockdown rules state cars should only be used to purchase essential supplies such as food or medicine, and exercise should be taken in the local area only.   Related: New Zealand sees 'positive' signs amid strict coronavirus lockdown    Clark said the revelation came about as part of his preparation for appearing in front of the epidemic response committee on Tuesday, requiring him to provide prime minister Jacinda Ardern “with a complete picture of my activity outside my home during alert level 4”. Clark said the beach trip during level 4 lockdown was a clear breach, and he had offered his resignation to Ardern – who had not accepted it. “At a time when we are asking New Zealanders to make historic sacrifices I’ve let the team down. I’ve been an idiot, and I understand why people will be angry with me,” Clark said in a statement. “As the health minister, it’s my responsibility to not only follow the rules but set an example to other New Zealanders … I’ve apologised to the prime minister for my lack of judgement and offered her my resignation. Ardern responded swiftly to Clark’s revelation, stripping him of his associate finance minister portfolio and demoting him to the bottom of the cabinet rankings. Political commentators say it is likely Clark will lose the health portfolio when the coronavirus crisis is resolved, and criticised him for failing to show his face regularly or taking on more of a leadership role, leaving that job to Dr Ashley Bloomfield, the director-general of health. “Under normal conditions, I would sack the minister of health. What he did was wrong, and there are no excuses,” Ardern said in a statement. “But right now, my priority is our collective fight against Covid-19. We cannot afford massive disruption in the health sector or to our response. For that reason, and that reason alone, Dr Clark will maintain his role.” “But he does need to pay a price. He broke the rules.” Ardern said New Zealanders expected their ministers to uphold the rules that they themselves had set, which were trying circumstances for everyone to adhere too. Under level 4 lockdown, which New Zealanders have been under for nearly two weeks, Kiwis cannot leave their homes except for essential supplies such as food or medicine, and could only take brief bouts of exercise in their local area. “I expect better, and so does New Zealand,” Ardern said. Clark is not the only high-profile New Zealander to flout the rules. All Blacks first five Richie Mo’unga has apologised after he was filmed kicking and passing a rugby ball with other professional players at his local park. “I want to start off by saying this was not an organised training. There were no communications beforehand saying that we should train in this park together. It was by coincidence that I rocked up and they were there training,” Mo’unga said on social media, but the prime minister and NZ rugby have both criticised the meet-up. Mo’unga went on to say he intended to run around the park alone, but “instinct” made him pick up the rugby ball. “It’s something that I’ve learnt that even [though it was] my natural instincts, it’s something I need to be more careful of and I will be more careful of.” Cases of coronavirus have begun to stabilise and decline in New Zealand, with experts saying the country may be the only western nation with a chance of totally eradicating the disease. “This does suggest that what we are doing as a nation is working,” Ardern said at her daily media briefing. “We do appear at this early stage to be on track” Fifty-four new cases of the virus were confirmed on Tuesday, bringing the total to 1,160. One person has died from the virus, an older woman with pre-existing health conditions on the west coast of the South Island. Twelve people are being treated for the virus in hospital, with four of those requiring intensive care. On Tuesday more people recovered from the illness than contracted it, the director-general of health said, an encouraging milestone."
60,health,Bradford puts money on libraries to boost city's health,"The library at Thebes was said to have the inscription “Medicine for the soul” above its doors – a notion Bradford council is set to put to the test with plans to offset major library cuts with funds from its health and wellbeing budget. The West Yorkshire council is just one of the local authorities up and down the country which has dealt with shrinking reserves by closing hundreds of libraries. Last year, it proposed chopping £2 million from its libraries spending over two years, a funding reduction of two-thirds. The biggest cut of £1.05m was due to hit at the start of this coming financial year, until the council came up with what could be described as a novel idea. At a January meeting, a rescue package was proposed — diverting funds from the council’s health and wellbeing budget to reduce the impact of the cuts on libraries. If the decision is ratified by the full meeting of the council’s executive on 4 March, it will mean injecting £700,000 into libraries, dramatically reducing the proposed cuts for the coming financial year and alleviating fears voiced by library campaigners and staff — who took strike action in October in protest against the cuts — that job losses and branch closures would be inevitable. Not only that, but the proposal on the table is for a recurring annual investment of that amount. If the decision is passed, then it will be a firm commitment and recognition by Bradford that libraries really are medicine for the soul – an inspiration for other authorities who facing savage library cuts.     Libraries are social spaces as well as book repositories. Photograph: Johner Images/Getty Images    This week, Bradford Metropolitan District Council announced it was opening a consultation process for residents to give their views on the proposals and was also “exploring wider funding opportunities which would help support ambitions for a sustainable library service which meets the needs of local communities”.    The social interaction libraries provide is vital, especially for isolated people … We are remodelling how they work to meet the needs of the health agenda  Susan Hinchcliffe, leader, Bradford Council     Councillor Susan Hinchcliffe, the leader of Bradford Council who will be presiding over the meeting next month, said the council’s focus “has to be on preventing ill-health in the first place, not dealing with it after the fact. And libraries have a big part to play in that.” “A huge number of the decisions we have to make at the council are about the health and wellbeing of people,” Hinchcliffe said. “Books are of course hugely important in libraries but there are many other aspects. The social interaction they provide is vital, especially for isolated people. They host clubs and events, they provide information and access to the internet. “We are remodelling how libraries work to meet the needs of the health agenda. Libraries are symbols of community and we have to be passionate about libraries and how they serve these communities.” Bradford council’s decision was taken internally, the council confirmed, with no outside experts called in. But according to Dr Ricky Lawton, co-author of a 2015 Arts Council report into libraries and health, the link between libraries and wellbeing is well established. “We interviewed two large groups, library users and non-users, and library usage was associated with higher levels of happiness and satisfaction,” Lawton said. “What’s often important to councils in these situations is the cultural value of a service ... We know libraries are beneficial anecdotally, but with our research we tried to look at how valuable they were in monetary terms, by asking people if they would hypothetically be prepared to pay for the services they receive.”     Bradford City Hall. Photograph: Mark Sunderland/robertharding/Getty Images/Robert Harding World Imagery    This was the first time he had heard of a local authority putting funds from health provision into library services, he continued, but “Bradford putting money from its health and wellbeing budget into libraries does seem to suggest they are subscribing to our research”.    If we didn't have libraries, I think people would be very miserable    Users at Bradford’s City Library tended to agree. “Libraries have tangible benefits for health,” said regular library user Paul Davies, “especially mental health.” Another regular library user, Frances, who lives in nearby Shipley agreed. “I would say that libraries are definitely good for health and wellbeing,” she said. “Not just in terms of reading and what that gives you, but also the social aspect of visiting a library, especially for people who live on their own.” A Bradford libraries card holder since the 1970s, she welcomed the initiative: “It’s entirely appropriate to spend money from the health and wellbeing budget on libraries. I see a lot of people using the libraries. Some go in just to borrow books, some go in to use the computers, some go in for a chat with a friendly face. “If we didn’t have libraries, I think people would be very miserable.”"
61,health,Aboriginal health services warn of 'catastrophic' shortage of coronavirus protective equipment,"Rural Aboriginal medical services are facing a “catastrophic” shortage of personal protective equipment, which has left some clinics with just two weeks’ supply in the lead-up to the Covid-19 peak. The Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council of NSW has warned that clinics in places like the far west town of Coonamble, where confirmed Covid-19 cases are beginning to emerge, require urgent action to boost PPE stocks. Phil Naden, the chair and acting chief executive of the AHMRC said “the demand was there, obviously, but there’s just no supply”. “We’re down to two weeks PPE, at the most, in a lot of our clinics,” he told the Guardian. “It’s a bit catastrophic at the moment, particularly with everything happening and the need for it.” Naden warned some clinics may need to take dramatic steps if stocks were not replenished.   Related: Frontline doctors prepare for ‘death and suffering’ when coronavirus hits Indigenous communities    “The reality is that if you haven’t got it, to me, you shouldn’t function without it,” he said. “You’re not only putting yourself at risk, you’re putting clients, family, your community at risk, everyone you come into contact with.” PPE shortages have been felt right across the healthcare sector, to varying degrees. The federal government is responding by releasing additional supplies from its emergency reserves in the national medical stockpile, while triaging requests from health and aged care providers to ensure the most pressing needs are met. It has also moved to boost domestic production at the factory of existing PPE supplier Med-Con, and has issued a callout to other domestic manufacturers to identify who may be able to pivot into PPE production. The government’s official advice is that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are at greater risk from Covid-19 because of overall poor health, overcrowded housing and high rates of respiratory disease, heart disease and diabetes, which increase the fatality rates of the virus. A taskforce of experts in Indigenous health and epidemiology advising the national cabinet has released a detailed plan for dealing with the virus, which recommends urgent supplies of PPE and other medical equipment to regional and remote areas. Frontline doctors say they are “preparing for death and suffering” in Aboriginal and Islander communities, because they don’t have the resources to evacuate very ill people. “I don’t think our people are ready to face this serious virus,” Coonamble Aboriginal medical centre board member Gloria Fernando said. “My worries for the elders are when they urgently need medical care and the hospitals are overcrowded. They will be forgotten about and left to die due to old age, because they will attend to the younger generation first. “I definitely think our mob and our community have been forgotten about. “I’m disappointed with our local shire, who supposedly run our town, for not putting things in place for our community. “They have held one meeting that I know of and that was at the direction from our Coonamble Aboriginal Health Service to stakeholders to call a meeting about Covid- 19, but they didn’t invite any elders to speak on the First Nations people who are the most vulnerable to catch this virus.” The World Health Organization has warned that PPE is critical in any effort to stop the spread of the virus. It has called on nations to lift their domestic production by 40% and end export restrictions. The Orange Aboriginal Medical Service, in NSW’s central west, says it is attempting to conserve PPE as much as it possibly can, with face masks and sanitiser the items of highest need. The service typically orders PPE monthly. It put in an order two weeks ago for new stocks, but the supplier said it was unable to give any ETA for when the equipment would arrive. Chief executive Jamie Newman said the service had been given an interim supply of PPE by its peak body, and was now trying to reduce demand by moving as much of its services into telehealth as possible and sending administrative staff to work from home. “It’s about changing our business,” Newman said. “Whether it’s three months, six months, or six weeks, we have to be smart business-wise in how we maintain resources, client care, and looking after our own staff.”   Related: What happens in the rest of Australia matters here. Please stay home – for yourselves and for us | Sarah Brown    The shift to telehealth had been aided by this week’s federal government announcement of a $500m telehealth package, which had made it more viable for GPs. “Like most other services, we’ve got limits on what we can be supplied with,” Newman said. “I suppose it’s up to every Aboriginal medical service in the region, the state, and the country, about what level of service we can provide, and the majority of that is through telehealth.” “We’re trying to keep our hospitals from being overinflated with numbers, because if people can’t get that level of health care through a general practice or an Aboriginal Medical Service, they’re going to be flooding the hospitals, or they’re going to be at home suffering. “That’s the last thing we want to see happen.”"
62,health,Sunshine on way to UK but health officials stress: stay home,"Public health officials have stressed it is vital people stay at home amid fears a combination of sunny weather and lockdown fatigue could result in government guidance being ignored this weekend. 
With temperatures forecast to reach 20C (68F) in some parts of the UK from Saturday, there are concerns roads and parks could become busier, with some police forces braced to deter day-trippers from beauty spots. 
“Whatever the weather, we all have a shared responsibility to protect those around us, and the single most important action we can all take in fighting coronavirus is to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives,” said Prof Jonathan Van Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England. 
Downing Street said it “cannot stress the vital importance of staying at home wherever possible” amid worries that an increase in car use could be an early sign of the lockdown breaking down. 
 Boris Johnson highlighted concerns, tweeting: “Yesterday’s data showed more people were using transport than in previous days. Please do not leave your home unless absolutely necessary. It really will save lives.”

Ten days into the formal lockdown, Andy Slattery, assistant chief constable of Cumbria, said he was concerned that “boredom and frustration” were setting in and people were getting back into their cars, ignoring guidance to exercise locally. 
Though the number of visitors to the Lake District had dropped, police were still having to tell day-trippers to go home. “We’ve stopped and spoken to day-trippers from the north-east and the north-west thinking it’s still OK to come to the Lake District – it isn’t.” 
He added: “I am worried that people [who] had decided to stay at home, now a week, 10 days in, may be thinking they’ll just get in the car and go here or there.”

In London messages will be pumped out on social media from Friday urging people to resist the capital’s forecast mini-heatwave and stay inside. 
Police forces across the country were assessing intelligence and briefing officers on patrol about making sure there was no slippage in the lockdown at the weekend. One senior officer told the Guardian the bigger concern was Easter weekend, when forces were considering boosting patrols dedicated to policing the lockdown. 
There remains a nagging concern among police about how long the public will observe the draconian restrictions. The concern is that over time the level of compliance will dip. 
 Prof Ivo Vlaev, a behavioural change scientist at Warwick Business School and a government adviser, said he did not expect violations of the guidance on the basis of what he knew, and from previous research. 
 
  
  
   
    
    Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:
    
     a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back
     a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly
    
    NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;stay at home for at least 7 days.
    If you live with other people,&nbsp;they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.
    After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.&nbsp;Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.
    If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.
    If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.
    After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.
    If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.
    If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.
    Staying at home means you should:
    
     not go to work, school or public areas
     not use public transport or taxis
     not have visitors, such as friends and family, in your home
     not go out to buy food or collect medicine – order them by phone or online, or ask someone else to drop them off at your home
    
    You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.

“What we know is that with compelling narrative and reasons, people are capable of maintaining remarkable solidarity over long periods of times of national crisis, especially when the narrative is a collective narrative. And, in fact, we know from evidence that panic is much less likely behaviour. In fact more likely behaviours are related to cooperation and altruism and solidarity.” 
Research on the effectiveness of school closures in previous epidemics shows children, especially teenagers, continued to leave home and socialise despite public health recommendations. 
A team from King’s College London reviewed 19 studies of school closures from different countries around the world during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic and other influenza-like outbreaks. Schools then were closed for a far shorter time than is likely during the current crisis, from one day to a maximum of two weeks. 
The research found that though children’s interactions with others reduced significantly during the closure, social contact with others outside the home remained common.

Some of the studies featured adolescents leaving their homes to meet friends and go to parties and fast food restaurants. One UK study of school closures during the H1N1 outbreak found that 98% of children left their homes during the closure. 
Commenting on the study, Andrea Danese, a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s, said: “This timely review suggests that school closure can be effective to reduce social interaction and, thus, the spread of infection. However, the review also clearly suggests that, for such top-down measures to be effective, children and families cannot simply be seen as passive recipients of government decisions.”"
63,health,NSW health minister defends experts who handled Ruby Princess coronavirus outbreak,"The New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, has defended the role of health experts who allowed 2,700 passengers to disembark the Ruby Princess cruise ship and make their own way home, following reports that authorities knew about the widespread respiratory sickness on board. As recriminations about the Ruby Princess saga continued on Saturday, the NSW police conducted the largest maritime operation in Sydney Harbour outside of wartime to move crew and supplies between a series of stranded cruise ships before they depart Australian waters. NSW Health has confirmed it had been aware of 104 people with “acute respiratory infections” on the Ruby Princess before it docked in Sydney. Leaked emails show the ship’s doctor told authorities on 18 March that people who had presented at the onboard medical clinic with flu-like symptoms had tested negative for influenza.   Related: Civil liberties concerns over Australian police powers to issue fines for coronavirus rule breaches    Yet on 19 March about 2,700 passengers were allowed to depart the ship at Sydney’s Circular Quay and travel onward, before test swabs had been analysed by state health authorities, who had considered the ship a “low risk” of carrying coronavirus. A total of 662 people linked to the cruise ship have been infected with Covid-19 and seven passengers have died. The NSW opposition leader, Jodi McKay, has described the incident as one of the most significant health failures in the state’s history and called on Hazzard to stand down. During a heated press conference appearance on Saturday, the health minister faced aggressive questioning about the government’s handling of the Ruby Princess. “Can I just say that the experts who made the decision were the best in the world,” Hazzard said. “Each of the staff of the chief health officer who made the decision made it to the best of their ability. And those people are experts in their field.” The NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said those who had died had all contracted the virus on board, and that authorities believed it might have spread through the ship from infected crew members preparing food. Sources familiar with ship said crew rarely disembarked and that the infection would have likely been brought on board by a passenger. Chant said that if NSW Health had known that coronavirus was on board the ship, they would have disembarked the passengers differently and moved them directly to self-isolation. But she said that would have only prevented 11 known cases of the virus that were subsequently spread within the community. “Cases that we could have averted by decanting people in a more ordered way with face masks and taking them directly to their homes, would have been in the order of 11,” Chant said. “The people that have acquired their infection on the cruise ship could not have been avoided and every period of time that people were on that cruise ship, there were actually at risk of more transmission on the cruise ship in a very, vulnerable age group.” NSW Health has said the rapid influenza tests conducted onboard the Ruby Princess often return false negative results and that it believed “the illness and test results identified on board was consistent with influenza”. Guardian Australia understands crew members on four Royal Caribbean ships – Celebrity Solstice, Ovation of the Seas, Voyager of the Seas and Spectrum of the Seas – are being sorted into groups according to their country of origin before the ships depart Australian waters. NSW police said these ships would return to their home ports, though maritime sources say that is unlikely as most are “flag of convenience” vessels registered in the Bahamas. Crew members who remain onboard are mostly Indonesian, Indian, Sri Lankan and Filipino. At least two of those ships – Voyager of the Seas and Celebrity Solstice – have been linked to fatal Covid-19 cases.     Cruise ships waiting off the heads of Sydney harbour on Saturday. Photograph: Ben Doherty/The Guardian    Documents seen by Guardian Australia show almost 800 crew members from Celebrity Solstice were transferred to two separate ships, the Ovation of the Seas and Voyager of the Seas, under police escort. More than 600 crew members were transferred from the Ovation of the Seas to Spectrum of the Seas.

In a statement, NSW police marine area commander Steve Hegarty said the operation has been planned for several days. “NSW Police has been instrumental in facilitating the movement of more than 750,000 tonnes of shipping through the Port of Sydney over about a 30-hour period,” he said. “It will be the largest peacetime maritime operation undertaken in Sydney Harbour and has relied on the cooperation of Royal Caribbean cruise line and the Port Authority of NSW to ensure its success.”"
64,health,Trump attacks Biden's cognitive health in possible general-election preview,"Donald Trump attacked Joe Biden’s cognitive abilities on Thursday night during an event in the former-vice president’s hometown that could set the tone for an ugly general election. 
 
  Related: Trump makes breezy, boastful assessment of coronavirus impact in US – live  
 
Appearing at a Fox News town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Trump – who has faced repeated scrutiny over his own mental acuity – said there was “something going on” with Biden, in what may prove a rehearsal for Republican attacks during the presidential election. 
Thursday marked Trump’s first public event since Biden’s surprisingly strong performance on Super Tuesday, when he won 10 out of 14 states available to propel him into the lead in the Democratic primary. Trump said he had been “all set” to face Biden’s rival Bernie Sanders, whom he called a “communist”, until the recent vote. 
“Then we have this crazy thing that happened on Tuesday, which [Biden] thought was Thursday, but he also said 150 million people were killed with guns and that he was running for the United States Senate. There’s something going on there,” Trump said. 
Biden – who did say those things – has a track record of gaffes, and has turned in bumbling debate performances, but Trump’s line of attack raised the unedifying spectacle of an election focused on two men in their 70s attacking each other’s perceived cognitive decline. 
Biden did not immediately respond to Trump, who was speaking at the Scranton Cultural Center, on the street where Biden grew up, a mile and a half north-east. The town hall was hosted by the Trump-friendly Fox News but had a more sedate vibe than Trump’s rallies, with many of the crowd wearing button-up shirts and not a single Make American Great Again hat to be seen. 
Trump, who brushed off questions about his handling of the coronavirus outbreak – suggesting the economy could benefit because Americans may choose not to travel abroad – has had his own faculties questioned during his presidency. 
In December, 350 psychiatrists and other mental-health professionals sent a letter to Congress warning that Trump’s mental health was deteriorating. The anonymous government official who penned an op-ed in the New York Times warning about Trump – and subsequently wrote the book A Warning – claimed people in Trump’s administration were concerned about him. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
“Normal people who spend any time with Donald Trump are uncomfortable by what they witness. He stumbles, slurs, gets confused, is easily irritated, and has trouble synthesizing information, not occasionally but with regularity,” the anonymous author wrote. 
As Trump spoke, Maryland announced three residents had contracted the coronavirus, the first cases in the state. In the US 12 people have now died, and the government has been criticized for its slow response to the coronavirus, but on Thursday Trump instead suggested he had been given “tremendous marks” for his response.

“We’ve done a great job. We’ve got the highest poll numbers of anybody for this kind of thing,” Trump said. 
“Mike Pence is working 20 hours a day or more on this and really doing a fantastic job.” 
In fact a Public Policy Polling survey found that 51% of Americans disapprove of the Trump administration’s handing of the epidemic, and 53% of people disagree with Trump’s claim that he has done “a great job” in handling the coronavirus. 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.6% on Thursday as the US stock market continued to decline amid fears over the epidemic, but Trump claimed the economic damage could be offset by Americans not traveling abroad. 
“I have to say, people are now staying in the United States, spending their money in the US – and I like that,” Trump said. 
Trump narrowly won Pennsylvania in 2016, by 48.2% to Hillary Clinton’s 47.5%, and the state is a key part of his potential path to victory in November. He has held seven rallies in the state since he was elected, including two in the past year, although the nomination of Biden could provide a fillip to Democrats’ chances in Pennsylvania. 
The exit from the Democratic race over the last week of Mike Bloomberg, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar – all of whom subsequently endorsed Biden – has left the Scranton native in a formidable position in the race to take on Trump.

65,health,'We're not ready': coronavirus looms over the fragile Afghan health system,"In the Guzargah reception centre for returnees and repatriates in Herat, Afghanistan, 17-year-old Yunos rests on a thin mattress in a small, empty room. The previous night fatigued him. He spent it sleeping rough in the desert along with thousands of other Afghans, awaiting the opening of the Iran-Afghanistan border. The frigid desert air froze him to the bone and hunger disturbed his sleep. Yunos moved to Iran one year ago. He crossed the border illegally under the cover of night and made his way to Tehran, where he found a job as an electrician. Last week, however, he decided to return to Afghanistan. The Covid-19 pandemic in Iran has already infected more than 30,000 people, killing nearly 2,400. Many of the 2 million Afghan workers there have lost their jobs, falling into despair. “In Tehran all shops and companies have closed, the costs of living rocketed. If you do not work in necessary services, you can’t go outside,” Yunos says. “All Afghans are returning home from Iran these days due to the coronavirus. We are terrified. We don’t want to die in a strange land.” Since late February, more than 115,000 Afghans have returned home through the border crossing in Herat province in what has been the biggest inwards migration wave in Afghanistan’s recent history. Herat’s governor, Abdul Qayum Rahimi, estimated that close to half of the returnees “might be virus carriers”, raising fears that the influx will place greater strain on Afghanistan’s fragile health system. While Afghanistan has so far reported only 123 Covid-19 cases – including 80 in Herat – and four deaths, officials believe that the real number of infections could be much higher. In a few weeks, the cash-strapped Afghan healthcare system will be put through a test of resilience. Western NGOs have rushed to evacuate their foreign staff and this week the US stripped Afghanistan of $1bn (£801m) worth of support, leaving Afghan health workers as the country’s only defence in the the fight against the pandemic.   Related: Coronavirus in a war zone: Afghanistan braces for outbreak after first case    Jawad*, is bracing for what is to come. The infectious diseases department where he works has been responsible for diagnosing patients before they are transferred to a new 100-bed Covid-19 hospital. In his ward, three doctors, three nurses and one specialist are tending to 200 patients. The lack of equipment such as protective masks, hand sterilisers and medical ventilators is the norm. According to Jawad, the hospital doctors have only one or two masks a day at their disposal. “I have to keep my mood well, but I’m worried about my family,” Jawad says, before he returns to the hospital for a 24-hour shift. “We haven’t tested ourselves for Covid-19 yet. If someone in our department tests positive, the hospital will be paralysed and there will be no one to provide the services.” According to Ali*, another doctor from Herat, the new Covid-19 hospital is ready to admit roughly 150 patients. But once the number of infections passes 1,000, Ali believes, the situation will get out of control. And the predictions have been grim. According to the Afghan ministry of health, the coronavirus could infect 25 million of the country’s 35.5 million people.       “Afghanistan is a country that has been affected by gross conflict for the past 40 years. There has been a lot of internal displacement, a lot of people who don’t have access to services and education, water, basic healthcare. The situation in hospitals is very daunting, especially with the increasing arrivals from Iran,” says Nicholas Bishop, the emergency response officer at the International Organization for Migration. In the main Covid-19 hospital in Herat, only ten doctors, one specialist and twenty nurses tend to all patients. Even though the province recently received 400m afghanis (£4.2m) from the central government to fight the pandemic, supplies are scarce.     The majority of coronavirus cases have been in Herat province, which borders Iran. Photograph: Jalil Rezayee/EPA    A countrywide awareness campaign designed to improve levels of understanding of the signs and symptoms of the virus has been in full swing. In Herat alone, 2,000 volunteers are going door to door to inform people. But this may prove insufficient to tame the spread of the disease. “We are facing problems with compliance, because of the lack of awareness, people’s religious beliefs, and because we went through very difficult times in the past 40 years”, says Rahimi. “Until Afghans do not see things physically right in front of their eyes they do not get alarmed. We are working with the imams to stop prayer gatherings, but we have not been successful. It needs more discussion and this is what we are focusing on.” Meanwhile, for health workers in Herat and other provinces, the prospectof an outbreak looks grim. According to Ali, several medical professionals in Herat have tested positive for coronavirus in recent days. “We are not ready for the crisis,” he says. * Some names have been changed"
66,health,Monthly poll seeks to gauge mental health of UK under coronavirus,"A mental health charity has teamed up with academic institutions across the UK to monitor the psychological wellbeing of the nation as the coronavirus pandemic sweeps around the world. 
They will conduct monthly polls of Britons living under lockdown and any measures that followso that emerging mental health problems are spotted early on and interventions put in place. 
The move comes as Public Health England (PHE) publishes fresh guidelines on how people can look after their mental health and wellbeing during the outbreak. The advice ranges from maintaining contact with friends and family with regular phone or video calls, keeping to a regular routine and sleep pattern, and focusing on a hobby. 
The Mental Health Foundation started work on the project with the Institute of Public Health at Cambridge University, and is now expanding involvement to include Swansea University and academic institutions in Scotland and Northern Ireland. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
The decision to survey the nation’s mental health under the unprecedented clampdown on movement and social interaction followed a YouGov poll the charity commissioned last week which found that nearly two-thirds of adults from a representative sample of 2,100 people felt anxious or worried about the outbreak. 
“The mental health impact of the pandemic is going to last longer than the physical health impact,” said Dr Antonis Kousoulis, the Mental Health Foundation’s research director. He said the charity intended to boost the number of people taking part in the poll from Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland to improve their representation. The polls are expected to run for four months but may be extended if necessary. 
Kousoulis said the surveys should reveal how people across society are responding to the outbreak in the UK and to news of the virus’s global impact. One red flag will be signs that mild stress and anxiety, which can help by encouraging people to adhere to public health advice, are developing into chronic conditions that can become serious mental health problems. 
Participants in the polls will also be asked about the causes of any distress to determine whether the most worrisome issues are debt, job insecurity, home life, concerns about contracting the virus or having loved ones infected, or other issues. 
Further questions are intended to reveal how people are coping throughpositive interactions such as social media groups, video chats and help from local groups, and whether there is a parallel increase in drinking and drug taking. 
 
  Related: Tell us: have you been affected by the coronavirus?  
 
The charity’s latest poll found that 18 to 24-year-olds were most anxious about being separated from friends and family if they had to self-isolate. Kousoulis said he was also concerned about the over-70s, who are most at risk from the virus and may not be well equipped to keep in touch with others online. “We basically have a whole generation that is being asked to stay at home for 12 weeks with even more limited interactions than the rest of us,” he said. 
Pandemics have historically tended to hit poorer regions hardest, and the same trend could emerge with coronavirus. “We know that the risk to mental health is not distributed equally. We know that people who are in poorer households and neighbourhoods tend to be more at risk,” Kousoulis said. 
Linda Bauld, a professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said some adults who are working from home or are looking after patients may be at risk of drinking, smoking and taking drugs. “I think we need to recognise that these physical and mental health damaging behaviours are going to increase,” she said. “We need to pay much more attention to this and offer practical advice and support in the weeks ahead.”"
67,health,England's ravaged public health system just can't cope with the coronavirus,"About 20 years ago I was sitting with my family in a small cafe in the village of Trefin in west Wales. Apart from a small number of family groups, there was a large table with eight elderly women sitting around it. They were chatting and I was paying no attention until my ears pricked up on hearing the term “Spanish flu”. Fortunately the table was large, and their voices loud, so I was able to follow most of the discussion.   Related: In this crisis, the Tory cuts can no longer be hidden by empty gestures | Nesrine Malik    They were talking about various relatives who had died in 1919 when the flu had come to Wales. But one woman’s account, about the death of her grandmother, really captured my attention. She remembered clearly as a little girl being brought to her grandmother’s bedside when she was near death, and being cajoled into kissing her goodbye. I had always assumed that such a disaster could never happen again: general health had improved significantly, and in 1919 populations across Europe were exhausted and malnourished after the first world war, and didn’t have access to effective vaccinations, antibiotics and antiviral treatments. I was working in public health at regional level in England at the time of the overheard conversation – and I was confident that we had a robust structure, both in public health and the NHS, that could deal efficiently with any mass infectious disease. Now the world is faced with a virus with no readily available vaccine or treatment. The NHS has also had 10 years of significant underfunding – and England, in particular, has an operational and management system that is fragmented and lacks an effective command and control structure. The public health function in England has been removed from the NHS and incorporated into local government, where its budgets have been systematically raided to prop up local councils that have suffered catastrophic cuts in the name of austerity. Local authority functions closely aligned with public health, such as environmental health and social services, have been notable casualties. Within the local government world, the once powerful directors of public health have seen their influence decline, along with their staffing and resources.The impoverishment of the NHS and the public health system in England is not the only depletion that has occurred in civil society that makes us ill-equipped to respond effectively to the greatest global health crisis in a century. One of the first acts of the coalition government when it came to power in 2010 was to dismantle the regional structures that had provided a coherent mechanism for integrating and carrying out government policy within the English regions. The government offices for the regions (GOR) were established in 1994 by John Major’s administration as outposts of central government departments. They were tasked with implementing government-funded programmes and monitoring their performance. They also had an important coordination role at times of national emergency, such as during the fuel protest crisis of 2000. As well as doing away with the GOR as part of its spending review in 2010, the coalition also stripped the NHS of its regional management tier following the wide-ranging “reforms” of the 2012 Health and Social Care Act.The result is the absence of any integrational, coordinating or management function at a regional level in England that could operate between Whitehall departments and the various bodies, often very local, that are charged with implementing government policy. The fact that some national bodies have adopted internal organisational boundaries that cover completely different geographical territories has also complicated the situation. This is notably and unfortunately true with respect to the key health bodies, NHS England and Public Health England.This absence of useful civil society structures outside Whitehall, apart from elected mayors in conurbations such as Greater Manchester and London, means that the approaches adopted nationally to manage the enormous coronavirus crisis are just that – national. The daily announcements keep coming, but the mechanisms available to integrate and implement various initiatives around the country are weak to non-existent. This lack of a two-way communications and governance structure has reinforced the perception of a government that is Whitehall-centric, distant from the real world and managing things by press conference. At the heart of a country’s response to a catastrophic public health crisis should be a robust, dynamic and integrated public health system. The hollowing out of England’s public health capability, and of the integrating structures outside Whitehall, has hampered our response. • Gabriel Scally is a former regional director of public health and honorary professor of public health at the University of Bristol"
68,health,Half of British women 'have poor sexual health',"Almost half of women in Britain have poor sexual health – almost three times the rate in men – researchers have said. Women’s sexual problems have been found to be more varied than those experienced by men. Nearly a third of all women were found to experience difficulties rooted in a lack of interest in sex – a problem associated with distress and dissatisfaction with their sex life. Dr Alison Parkes of the University of Glasgow, a co-author of the research, said: “We think [the wider range of problems in women] may boil down to women’s general lesser agency when it comes to negotiating more pleasurable as well as safer sex with their partners.” While 83% of men were deemed to be in fine sexual fettle, 48% of women had poor sexual health. The team said the figures highlighted both the higher prevalence and greater range of sexual health problems experienced by women, and stressed that lack of desire should not be overlooked by sexual health services. However, experts have previously warned that cuts to sexual health services have left many in need of support with fewer options, particularly those experiencing problems with sexual function.   Related: Sexual dysfunction cuts risk 'leaving thousands in UK without help'    Writing in the journal BMC Public Health, Parkes and colleagues report how they analysed data from the most recent national survey of sexual behaviours in Britain conducted in 2011 and 2012. The data covered more than 5,000 men and more than 7,000 women aged 16-74 who were sexually active in the previous year. Participants were asked about many areas of their sexual health, from unplanned pregnancies to STIs and problems with sexual function. The team then used computer models to explore whether various problems clustered together, revealing four categories shared by both men and women. About 83% of men and 52% of women fell into a “good sexual health” category, which encompassed those with a low probability of any sexual health problems. However, 4% of men and 2% of women were “wary risk takers” – with a higher probability of having unprotected sex but a greater savviness about the risk of STIs – and 4% of men and 7% of women were “unwary risk takers”, shunning condoms with little awareness of the risks. The fourth category was dominated by those more likely to report sexual function problems, such as difficulty reaching orgasm, and encompassed 9% of men and 7% of women. The computer models generated two extra categories for women. The first was predominately characterised by having a “low interest” in sex – the most common form of sexual dysfunction in women – and comprised 29% of women surveyed. The second, encompassing 2% of women, was a “highly vulnerable” category – with characteristics including a greater probability of sexual coercion, STI diagnoses, various aspects of sexual dysfunction and abortion. For women, all five categories of poorer sexual health were linked to distress and lower satisfaction with their sex life, relative to having good sexual health, while for men only sexual function problems were linked with higher distress. “Men don’t seem to be similarly affected by exposure to STIs,” said Parkes. “That doesn’t seem to bother men quite so much as women.” Some characteristics were found to be common to different categories of poorer sexual health, such as depression, while drug and alcohol use, and first sexual experiences at an early age were linked to many categories of poor sexual health across the sexes. There were also specific differences between categories: for example women with low interest in sex tended to be older, while the prevalence of different relationship styles varied across categories. While the study does not reveal cause and effect, the authors say it suggests that policies that tackle issues underpinning many categories may improve a broad range of sexual health problems, and that particular interventions could be tailored to certain groups. Dr Peter Greenhouse of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said it was not surprising that women experienced a more diverse and higher rates of sexual health problems, not least because of unwanted pregnancies, painful conditions including endometriosis, greater risk of sexual coercion and STIs usually being transmitted more easily from men to women. He also pointed out that the data for the new study was collected several years ago, and therefore it did not capture the impact of dating apps such as Tinder on sexual ill-health. But he said the scale of the disparity between men and women’s sexual ill-health “screams out” of the study, highlighting the need to reverse cuts to sexual health services. “The clinics have never been weaker than they are now, just when they need to be stronger, and even better resourced for women because of this disparity,” he said."
69,health,Revealed: how drugs giants can access your health records,"The Department of Health and Social Care has been selling the medical data of millions of NHS patients to American and other international drugs companies having misled the public into believing the information would be “anonymous”, according to leading experts in the field. Senior NHS figures have told the Observer that patient data compiled from GP surgeries and hospitals – and then sold for huge sums for research – can routinely be linked back to individual patients’ medical records via their GP surgeries. They say there is clear evidence this is already being done by companies and organisations that have bought data from the DHSC, having identified individuals whose medical histories are of particular interest. Concerns that the data is not truly “anonymous” have been raised by senior NHS officials, who believe the public are not being told the full truth. But the DHSC insists it only sells on information after thorough measures have been taken to ensure the complete anonymity and confidentiality of patients’ personal information. In December, the Observer revealed that the government had raised £10m in 2018 by granting licences to commercial and academic organisations across the world that wanted access to so-called anonymised data. If patients do not want their data to be used for research they have to actively “opt out” of the system at their GP surgery. Access to NHS data is increasingly sought by researchers and global drugs companies because it is one of the largest and most centralised public organisations of its kind in the world, with unique data resources. Washington has already made clear it wants unrestricted access to Britain’s 55 million health records – estimated to have a total value of £10bn a year – as part of any post-Brexit trade agreement. Leaked details of meetings between US and UK trade officials late last year showed that the acquisition of as much UK medical data as possible is a top priority for the US drugs industry. Now the DHSC and the agencies responsible for handling and selling data are increasingly under pressure to tighten up controls, to protect patient privacy and prevent information being misused. Asked if it was right to say that the patient data was anonymous, as claimed, Professor Eerke Boiten, director of the Cyber Technology Institute at De Montfort University in Leicester, said: “The answer is no, it is not anonymous. “If it is rich medical data about individuals then the richer that data is, the easier it is for people who are experts to reconstruct it and re-identify individuals.” Boiten believes more thought should be given to controlling and limiting the sale of data to prevent it potentially being sold on by the initial purchaser to companies with huge information stores and global reach. “If Google, for instance, were to use this data and end up finding a cure for cancer, and then sold the cure back to the NHS for huge sums of money, then I think we could say we had missed a trick,” he said. The NHS has previously faced claims that medical data from millions of patients has been sold to insurance companies. Phil Booth, coordinator of medConfidential, which campaigns for the privacy of health data, said the public was being betrayed by claims that the information could not be linked back to individuals. “Removing or obscuring a few obvious identifiers, like someone’s name or NHS number from the data, doesn’t make their medical history anonymous,” he said. “Indeed, the unique combination of medical events that makes individuals’ health data so ripe for exploitation is precisely what makes it so identifiable. Your medical record is like a fingerprint of your whole life. “Patients must know how their data is used, and by who. Alleging their data is anonymous when it isn’t, then selling it to drugs and tech companies – or, through intermediaries, to heaven knows who – is a gross betrayal of trust. People who are rightly concerned about such guile and lack of respect have every right to opt out, if they want their and their family’s medical information kept confidential and for their own care.” Licences to buy data are issued by the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), part of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). A spokesman said any information sold had been “anonymised in accordance with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) anonymisation code of practice”. Until early December, the CPRD said on its website the data it made available for research was “anonymous” but, following the Observer’s story, it changed the wording to say that the data from GPs and hospitals had been “anonymised” – meaning only that some measures had been taken to de-identify it. Booth added: “Following the ICO’s code of practice does not mean that data is necessarily anonymous. The law now recognises that one of the most common methods of ‘anonymisation’ – the use of pseudonyms to obscure some bits of information – means that data is still identifiable. Indeed, the information commissioner herself says it must be considered personal data.” A spokesman for the MHRA said the wording on the website had changed – but only to be consistent: “We have replaced the word ‘anonymous’ with ‘anonymised’ to be in line with the ICO terminology ‘anonymised,’ which is the term we use throughout our website. We have done this to be consistent and to avoid any confusion.” Information disclosed by some of CPRD’s customers clearly suggests they can link the information back to individual patient records via their GP surgeries. The Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Program in the US, which uses DHSC data, says on its website: “Anonymized information from the CPRD on demographics, outpatient visits, hospitalizations and prescriptions dispensed is available to [our] researchers. Validation of diagnoses, reports of diagnostic tests and anonymized notes from hospitalizations and referrals can be obtained from the general practitioner upon request.” If the data were truly anonymous it would be impossible to retrieve an individual patient’s medical notes.Neil Bhatia, a GP who is Information Governance Lead and data protection 0fficer in Hampshire, said: “Truly anonymous data – utterly incapable of being traced back to an individual – is very hard to achieve, given that there is so much information about us in the public domain and held by companies such as Facebookand Google, because so much of our personal data is out there thanks to the massive data breaches over the last few years. In fact, it’s almost impossible for record-level data (where each line of the dataset corresponds to an individual) to be made truly anonymous.” • This article was amended on 11 February 2020 to include a response from the MHRA that was received after the initial publication deadline."
70,health,US private health insurance companies clog system amid Covid-19 pandemic,"As Augie Lindmark, a resident physician at Yale University prepared for an onslaught of Covid-19 patients last week, he noticed something at his hospital: there were still patients without the virus, completely stable, in the beds. 
These patients, many of whom should have been moved to a rehab facility or released, were stuck waiting until their private health insurance company authorized the next steps, which can take days. 
 
  Related: The ER Diaries: inside a California hospital, a sneeze can cause a panic  
 
Usually, the prior authorization process is an expected inefficiency at Yale, and most other American hospitals. But with thousands of Covid-19 patients being admitted every day across the country, and a critical shortage of hospital beds, that red tape now carries much more weight. 
“Any sort of slowing in the health system has dire consequences,” Lindmark said. 
In the past two weeks the reality of the Covid-19 pandemic has hit the country. States and cities have been weighing public health measures, making changes to government health plans, and pushing sweeping changes to everyday life. Physicians have largely sought to reschedule and cancel elective surgeries and other patient visits deemed non-essential to free up resources to handle the virus. 
But with a history of restrictive and confusing policies, private health insurance companies have lagged behind: making incremental changes to plans even as health providers seek to change course. 
 
  
  
   default
  
  
 
“They’re doing healthcare to make money, not to take care of people,” said Dr Judd Hollander, an emergency medicine physician and associate dean at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. Hollander has been instrumental in implementing Jefferson’s telemedicine program, which allows patients to consult health providers through secure video, over the past few years. 
Telemedicine, most experts agree, is an impactful and low-cost tool in slowing the spread of the virus. Telemedicine eases the burden on hospitals and hospital beds by redirecting patients without in-person needs. 
Donald Trump recently expanded telemedicine provisions under the Medicare plan – a public insurance plan for senior Americans – allowing physicians to get paid equally for in-person or remote visits, and approving more devices and programs like Skype to be used to telemedicine. 
But private health companies do not have to follow the same rules. 
“The federal government never aligned incentives, most states never passed meaningful legislation, and many commercial payers didn’t pay health systems for telemedicine,” Hollander said. “So now we’re left in this horrible scenario.” 
Several private physicians the Guardian spoke to were struggling to implement the systems from scratch as Covid-19 cases started to flood their states. Some physicians said older patient populations didn’t know how to use the technology. Others said the variations in private plans made it hard to make any new protocols without risking revenue, which could affect their employees. 
“I think the issue is that private insurances have not really made it clear that they will reimburse these visits and if so at what cost,” said Dr Vipul Patel, an orthopedic surgeon in Brooklyn.  
Riddhi Shah, the director of operations at a mental health clinic in Michigan, said insurance companies are hard to contact right now, and while the plans have dropped the prior authorization restrictions, the clinic still has to navigate new billing codes and financial loss.  
For those who have already built telemedicine systems, the demand is clear. 
As NYU Langone absorbs some of the largest populations of Covid-19 patients in the country, the telemedicine system has gone from serving 1,500 patients a month to about 3,000 a day in the past week, said Dr Shabana Khan, a child psychiatrist at NYU Langone who has been helping build the hospital system’s telemedicine capacity for the past few years. 
She said many private doctors, meanwhile, are burdened by the restrictions that insurance companies have placed in the past, which made it harder for them to set up a system like NYU. She pointed out that only 10 states have true telemedicine parity, which means providers can treat and bill for telemedicine visits like in-person visits. 
With the bureaucracy standing in their way, some doctors are trying to work around private insurance altogether. Sas Ponnapalli, founder of Beam Health Group, a telemedicine platform that connects patients and providers, saw 400 new health providers sign on last week. While the platform does allow private insurance, Ponnapalli said doctors are choosing to set their own rates to make the transition faster. 
“Doctors sometimes have to close their doors or quarantine themselves even if they’re still able to practice,” he said. ”They want to get up and running as soon as possible because they’re losing revenue so they’re bypassing insurance completely and charging cash.” 
Health insurance companies insist they have been adapting to the crisis. 
A spokesperson at Humana, one of the nation’s largest insurance companies, told the Guardian it is not charging patients for Covid-19 testing, and a representative of the Association of Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) pointed to a letter signed by various private payers about their commitment to fighting Covid-19. Aetna, another leading US insurer, has waived costs related to the illness for many members. This is partly because the federal government is requiring the plans to cover all visits, virtual and not, related to testing, said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research and advocacy firm, who tracks the private market. 
But that hasn’t stopped insurers from charging patients for other Covid-related charges. AHIP confirmed that out-of-pocket expenses for the treatment would not be waived, and could cost patients thousands of dollars. The average amount for someone admitted to the hospital with pneumonia, a respiratory condition that many coronavirus patients are facing, was $20,000 in 2018 for patients covered by private insurance, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Peterson. 
That could leave many people falling back on the age-old American dilemma: get healthcare or lose all financial security. And it could leave physicians finding loopholes and workarounds to stay afloat. 
“Insurance companies are not beholden to the patient, they are beholden to the shareholder,” Hollander said."
71,health,South Korea and China play down Kim Jong-un ill-health claims,"South Korea and China have played down speculation that Kim Jong-un is seriously ill, after a Seoul-based website reported that the North Korean leader had undergone heart surgery. Daily NK claimed Kim, who has not been seen in public for 10 days, was being treated at a private villa following the procedure this month. CNN, meanwhile, cited an anonymous US official as saying that Washington was “monitoring intelligence” suggesting that Kim was in “grave danger”. But Kang Min-seok, a spokesman at South Korea’s presidential Blue House, said there was “nothing to confirm rumours about chairman Kim Jong-un’s health, and no special movement has been detected inside North Korea as of now”. South Korea’s Yonhap news agency quoted an unnamed government official saying that reports Kim was seriously ill were “not true”. An official at the Chinese Communist party’s international liaison department, which deals with North Korea, told Reuters there was no reason to believe Kim was critically ill. Speculation about Kim’s health grew after he missed an event to mark the anniversary of the birth of his grandfather – and the country’s founder – Kim Il-sung, on 15 April.   Related: Kim Yo-jong: the sister of Kim Jong-un, fast 'becoming his alter ego'    Kim Jong-un underwent the procedure at a hospital in the county of Hyangsan on the country’s east coast on 12 April, according to the Daily NK, which is run mostly by North Korean defectors. The 36-year-old was continuing to receive treatment at a villa at the Mount Kumgang resort, it added. The report cited unnamed sources, and there has been no official comment from North Korean state media. Kim’s health had deteriorated in recent months due to heavy smoking, obesity and overwork, Daily NK said. “My understanding is that he had been struggling [with cardiovascular problems] since last August but it worsened after repeated visits to Mount Paektu,” it quoted a source as saying, referring to the country’s sacred mountain. The state news agency, KCNA, released photos of Kim riding a large white horse through snowy fields and woods on Mount Paektu, the spiritual homeland of the Kim dynasty, in October last year. A top White House adviser said on Tuesday that the US did not know what condition Kim was in. Asked about how political succession would work in North Korea, the national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, said: “The basic assumption would be maybe it would be someone in the family. But, again, it’s too early to talk about that because we just don’t know what condition chairman Kim is in and we’ll have to see how it plays out.”  Daily NK claimed Kim had been admitted to hospital after chairing a meeting of the ruling workers’ party’s politburo on 11 April – this was his most recent public appearance. He was absent when Pyongyang fired multiple short-range missiles last week and did not take part in low-key commemorations for Kim Il-sung’s anniversary, a national holiday known as the Day of the Sun. Some observers speculated that Kim had been limiting his public appearances this month as a precaution against the coronavirus pandemic. North Korea continues to insist that it has not discovered a single case of Covid-19, but experts and defectors have challenged those claims. It is not the first time that Kim’s failure to appear in public has triggered speculation about his health. In 2014, he dropped out of sight for nearly six weeks before reappearing with a cane. Days later, South Korea’s spy agency said he had undergone surgery to remove a cyst from his ankle. North Korean state media took the rare step of admitting that he was suffering from an “uncomfortable physical condition”, after TV footage showed him with a pronounced limp and he failed to attend an important parliamentary session. But the report did not address rumours that he was suffering from debilitating attacks of gout. “No one knows what’s going on inside North Korea,” said Martyn Williams, who is affiliated with the 38 North research website. “Kim Jong-il (Kim’s father) had been dead several days before it was announced and it took everyone by surprise,” Williams tweeted. “Kim Jong-un has been ‘missing’ before, and has always reappeared. That said, his absence this week was more notable.”"

    What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?
    
    According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment.
    About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.
    In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:
    
     a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back
     a new continuous cough - this means you’ve started coughing repeatedly
    
    As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.
    
    Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?
    
    Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.
    In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.
    
   
  
  
 
Diabetes UK has recently updated the information pages on its website after calls for advice; while Asthma UK posted a comprehensive blog and the British Heart Foundation has issued guidance. The Cystic Fibrosis Trust, the Primary Immunodeficiency UK (PID UK), Macmillan UK and the Mental Health Foundation have also sought to allay fears and provide support. 
But people with respiratory conditions and compromised immune systems have described facing crippling anxiety about what could happen to them should an outbreak of coronavirus hit the UK. 
Georgie Wishart, a 30-year-old charity worker with ankylosing spondylitis, a condition which requires her to take immunosuppressants, described the daily battle to deal with her anxiety. 
“When it first came into the news, I was on the verge of having anxiety attacks because I didn’t know how I was going to cope,” she said. “There was genuinely a part of me thinking this is how I might die.

“I keep reminding myself of the facts: there aren’t that many confirmed cases, precautions are being taken, and that if it becomes a problem I will deal with it. Because if I didn’t say that to myself every day, it would be really difficult to leave the house.” 
A 37-year-old business owner from Brighton, which has seen the highest concentration of UK cases, explained that his family decided to self-isolate to protect his asthmatic daughter. 
“We are just checking news websites all the time,” he said. “We have spoken over the phone with our GP, but he was a young guy that just read out the general Public Health England guidelines.” 
He home-schooled his daughters for two weeks before sending them back to school after finding more statistics regarding children. Current evidence suggests that children do not appear to be vulnerable, with few cases of children testing positive for the virus. 
Several organisations representing people with underlying health conditions said they have seen an increase in calls for advice. 
Asthma UK has set up a crisis management group to track the progress of the virus. Calls to the charity are increasing daily, said Emma Rubach, head of health advice at Asthma UK. 
“We know that the risk to people with asthma from viruses like coronavirus is higher than the general population, so we are encouraging people to make sure their asthma is well-managed,” she said. 
Anxiety is high among other patient groups, such as people with cystic fibrosis, which can result in respiratory complications. Kevin Southern, a consultant paediatrician and cystic fibrosis specialist said: “It is very difficult to be reassuring at the moment, as it is unknown territory, but we are telling our families to follow the official advice, to be prepared, have extra antibiotics in the house and contact their teams with any concerns.” Advice from the Cystic Fibrosis Trust states that there is currently no need for people with cystic fibrosis to limit their activities. 
Susan Walsh from the PID UK said they were advising people to follow PHE guidelines. “We are also telling people that if they do feel ill they should contact a doctor promptly with details of their diagnosis, medication and immunology centre,” she said. “It’s a balance between raising awareness, but not creating great fear. It needs to be handled very carefully.” 
Derek Nott, director of support line services at Macmillan Cancer Support, said it was understandable that people with cancer “may be feeling more anxious” and said anyone concerned that they may have been in contact with someone with coronavirus, should follow advice from Public Health England, and call 111. He added that people needing clinical, practical and financial information should call the Macmillan support line on 0800 808 0000. 
Several people the Guardian spoke to said they were struggling to cope with the psychological weight of worrying about coronavirus. One 28-year-old PR consultant whose mother has late-stage ovarian cancer, said she had never “felt so totally out of control”. 
“Cancer robs people of a lot of choices and it feels like coronavirus is limiting me and my family even more,” she said. “I am desperate for someone to say something comforting. I yearn for an expert on coronavirus or cancer to tell us it’ll all be ok.” 
The Mental Health Foundation, which has advice for people with coronavirus-related anxiety and stress, said the uncertainty around coronavirus could breed fear. “The huge volume of news, fake news and comment about the virus can also leave people stressed out and afraid of what’s ahead,” said a spokesperson. The foundation suggests getting information from reliable sources, following hygiene advice, using stress management techniques and limiting news consumption. 
All the charities and individuals the Guardian spoke to called for members of the public to be aware that their hygiene habits were not only key to their own health and that of their families, but to vulnerable people throughout the country. 
“I am much more aware of the risk of catching infection and I am very diligent with my own hygiene but you really notice how other people just aren’t,” said Wishart, who travels into central London daily. 
“Yesterday I heard some people joking about it and it did make me quite angry. This is not a joke for people like me. If I catch [coronavirus] there is a very high risk of hospitalisation, and I could die.”

73,health,"Coronavirus cases in Africa pass 2,400 amid fears for health services","There are now more than 2,400 confirmed cases of Covid-19 across Africa and growing warnings that the pandemic will cause major challenges for the continent’s under-resourced health services. 
World Health Organization officials have said the statistics are likely to significantly underestimate the true number of cases. There have been 60 reported deaths so far. 
About a third of the cases are in South Africa, which recorded a steep rise overnight. The country’s health minister, Zweli Mkhize, said on Wednesday that the number of coronavirus cases had reached 709, up from 554 a day before. 
South Africa will go into a strict 21-day lockdown at midnight on Thursday in an attempt to avoid a “catastrophe of huge proportions”, said the president, Cyril Ramaphosa. He called on the 56 million people in sub-Saharan Africa’s most developed economy to show patience, courage and unity. 
The lockdown will confine all but essential workers to their homes, though journeys to buy groceries or seek medical attention will be allowed. All restaurants, fast-food outlets, pubs, bars and taverns will be shut and transportation of alcohol is banned. 
Bheki Cele, the police minister, said anyone thinking of ignoring the restrictions, faced six months in prison, a fine or both, and warned that two people have already been charged with attempted murder for refusing to obey orders to self-isolate. 
“You buy food and go and cook it at home. You can drink what you have at your home. There is no need to be on the road. There is no need to move around. There will be no dogs that shall be walked. If you want to walk your dog, walk your dog around your yard,” Cele said, during a marathon ministerial press conference. 
Ministers also announced measures to increase policing of gender-based violence during the lockdown, to provide secure accommodation to the homeless and to protect prisoners.

Though South Africa has a young population, and Covid-19 is deadlier among older people, there are millions who are vulnerable because of HIV or malnutrition. The healthcare system has long had an acute lack of resources and critical facilities are extremely limited. There has been widespread panic buying since the lockdown was announced. 
Other countries with high numbers of cases include Algeria, with 264, and Egypt, on 402. The first case has been reported in Libya. 
Most African nations have imposed restrictions and taken a range of extraordinary measures to try to combat the crisis. Many flights have been suspended, with entries for travellers from much of Europe and the US effectively impossible. 
Rwanda, Kenya and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have all imposed curfews and lockdowns in recent days. 
President Uhuru Kenyatta said that he and other top Kenyan officials would forego much of their salaries, and announced a package of support for one of Africa’s most dynamic economies. 
Authorities in the DRC, which has recorded 48 cases, are seeking to isolate the capital, Kinshasa, from the rest of the country, while Ethiopia is to release more than 4,000 prisoners in an effort to decongest crowded jails, according to state media. 
Mali recorded its first cases on Wednesday. Officials in the poor, unstable state recently denied reports it had only one ventilator for its 17 million inhabitants, saying it had 56. 
There are fears that lockdowns will bring significant hardship for the continent’s poor, many of whom live hand to mouth without formal employment.

Health officials across Africa know hospitals can deal with only a fraction of those needing care if the virus spreads through crowded cities, remote villages and among vulnerable populations such as refugees, malnourished people or those with HIV and other chronic conditions. 
South African authorities have said they will work to protect overcrowded neighbourhoods where social distancing and self-isolation are virtually impossible. The human settlements minister, Lindiwe Sisulu, said the government would reveal its strategy after consulting with communities. 
Nombulelo Tyokolo, 41, a domestic worker in Cape Town who shares a one-bedroom shack with her son, said she was concerned about how the lockdown will work. “I am scared, worried and panicking about 21 days indoors,” she said. “We have to fetch water outside and go outside to the toilets. God have mercy.”

False beliefs about who is vulnerable to the virus, and how to fight it, are a serious problem on the continent, as elsewhere. Officials have warned of the danger of spreading erroneous information, and many religious leaders have called on their congregations to avoid spreading fake news. 
Fartun Mohamed Nur, a 36-year-old mother of three in Mogadishu, Somalia, said she had once believed the disease would only hit non-Muslims or white people but had changed her mind after attending an information session run by a local NGO. 
“I have learned that this is a virus and affects all humans. I am now going home with my children. We were told to wash hands very well,” Nur said. “I am now prepared to protect myself and my children from coronavirus.” 
Christian Mulamba, a 35-year-old shoe seller in the commune of Kasa-Vubu, near Kinshasa, said coronavirus did not exist but was an excuse for politicians to make money from aid programmes. “This information is false ... I don’t give a damn about the rules of hygiene,” Malamba said.

74,health,Are western Europe's food supplies worth more than east European workers' health?,"White asparagus is late April’s delicacy across much of north-west Europe. In Germany the pale spears of the Spargel are cherished as “white gold”, their arrival each year marked by festivals and celebrations. But Germany alone needs 300,000 seasonal workers to harvest its crops. Over the past 10 years most of these workers have come from Romanian villages where seasonal migration is one of the few sources of income.   Related: Romanian fruit pickers flown to UK amid crisis in farming sector    This spring, however, the asparagus harvest ran into a big problem: Romania’s militarised coronavirus lockdown, enforced by a state of emergency, with police and army patrols in the streets fining anyone caught out without a written statement from employers or doctors. People have been forced to accept a 10pm curfew.  And it seems to have worked to protect the Romanian health system from a tsunami of cases. Despite big numbers of Romanian migrant workers returning from Spain and Italy at the height of the pandemic in southern Europe, the rate of Covid-19 infection and death in Romania has remained broadly under control. Until, that is, the imperatives of the asparagus supply chain kicked in. Pressed by German agriculture lobbies, the Berlin government asked the Romanian government to grant a bespoke exemption from the lockdown and clear an airbridge for farm workers. The Romanian government agreed, admitting that it had no income support system for this group of workers, who are usually invisible to the media unless as an object of class-driven scorn. So the asparagus imperative trumped the pandemic, even though Germany had earlier banned foreign workers and the Romanian lockdown was about to be prolonged for a further month. What followed was an epic stampede of thousands of workers to board low-cost flights specially chartered for the massive airbridge. Many had received their contracts on social media apps, others were raked in by able intermediaries, but all ended up crammed into the same nighttime bus rides to the airport. The ensuing images were shocking: a country in strict quarantine watched thousands streaming out of crammed busses into a small regional airport to board the planes. Given that many workers came from Suceava, Romania’s Covid-19 hotspot, we can only hope this will not turn out to have been one of Europe’s super-spreader events.     Romanian seasonal workers at Avram Iancu international airport in Cluj, central Romania. Photograph: Raul Stef/AP    This German arrangement, a deal between German employers and the federal government to cover the asparagus season, has inspired food growers in the UK and Italy where the spring and early summer fruit and vegetable harvests are on the brink of collapse for lack of labourers. Special charter flights from Bucharest to the UK are this week taking hundreds of workers to British farms after a recruitment drive closer to home fell flat. Many farm owners seem happier in any case to have rapid access to the “easterners”. In the words of one German farmer interviewed by the tabloid Bild: “Most Germans are not used to working stooped in the fields for hours on end. They complain about backache. Romanians and Poles are stronger and they work weekends and public holidays.” It turns out that besides a steely back, the Romanians and Bulgarians also need to be so desperate for work they don’t dare ask for a pandemic wage premium even if the employer requires them to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week, since switching farms will not be an option. For the duration of the contract they remain at the mercy of the employer, who alone has the power to organise the return journey. German trade unions have denounced the pact and are demanding decent pay, working conditions and coronavirus protection measures. But when the Romanian workers take the virus back home with them or when their backs break, the German health service won’t have to look after them. German employers will send them back home before the 115-day exemption from social security contributions runs out. The burden of any treatment will fall on the Romanian health system, the same one that has lost doctors and nurses to Germany and that is never likely to see a cent of the revenue generated by the sale of the crops. Below the same radar of media and political attention, thousands of Romanian and Bulgarian women have headed to Austria’s assisted living homes, because it turns out that rather than resource social care properly, Austria prefers to farm out the job to cheaper easterners. In many ways the asparagus cutters, salad pickers and care workers represent the most efficient form of labour in Europe: cheap, highly productive, untaxed even if humiliated and a potential public health hazard. Europe’s political economy has created the post-communist universal soldier, capable of converting from farm labourer to caregiver to construction worker as the the season changes. Freedom of movement has morphed into migration for survival and even that privilege is reserved for the physically fit. At the end of the day the huddled masses from the planes heading to the fields of Germany or Italy can rely on neither their own country nor the European Union. This begs tough questions about what east Europeans have a right to expect after years of EU membership: is this it? Why can we not demand a different Europe and renegotiate the social contract with it? Why is it so hard to guarantee the safety and the dignity of cross-border workers rather than reducing them to a dehumanised “labour supply” accessible with an app? Why does even the western left withdraw into fantasies about protected labour regimes while millions of east European workers toil under their noses? Why is the movement of millions of people in and out of quarantines, doing essential but undervalued work, not a European issue? EU enlargement to the east gave millions of workers an opportunity to survive. But it is not a generous gift. Western Europe’s supply chains and essential social services rely on it. • Costi Rogozanu is a Romanian political journalist based in Bucharest.

75,health,"At least 100 UK health workers have died from coronavirus, figures show","At least 100 health and care workers have died of coronavirus, a nursing website has said, amid growing concerns about a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) for those working on the frontline during the coronavirus pandemic. 
The number of nurses, doctors, porters and members of other professions who have died has been catalogued by Nursing Notes, a platform run by nurses for others in the profession. 
They announced that at 2pm GMT a milestone had been reached with at least 100 health and social care workers now believed to have died. The website has been recording all deaths since the outbreak began, verifying all the information they receive using a number of independent sources and permissions sought from family, friends or colleagues. 
The government has publicly verified 27 deaths of NHS staff from Covid-19 during the pandemic. 
Among those who have died are Linda Clarke, who worked as a delivery suite coordinator at the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary. She had worked in the maternity service for 30 years, with trust chiefs saying she had “brought many new lives into the borough”. 
 
  
  
   default
  
  
 
In a statement, Silas Nicholls, the chief executive at Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS trust, said: “We can sadly confirm that a member of our staff, Linda Clarke, tragically passed away on 17 April. Linda was 66 and worked in our maternity service for 30 years, bringing many new lives into our borough and caring for expectant mums in our community.” 
Ade Dickson, a mental health nurse for the Barnet crisis resolution and home treatment team, also died. A spokesperson from Barnet, Enfield and Haringey mental health trust said: “We are very sad to confirm the loss of our colleague and friend Ade Dickson due to coronavirus.” 
They added: “Ade was a highly respected colleague who will be deeply missed by his family, friends, trust staff and patients. We ask that you please respect their privacy at this difficult time.” 
The Guardian has also been recording the deaths of NHS staff and has written tributes for 81, with the number continuing to be updated as more names come in. 
Over the weekend, hospital leaders have directly attacked the government for the first time during the coronavirus crisis over the shortage of PPE after a desperately needed consignment of surgical gowns that had been announced by ministers failed to arrive. 
In an unprecedented intervention, which hospital leaders privately say is the result of “intense frustration and exasperation”, the organisations representing NHS trusts in England urged ministers to “just focus on what we can be certain of” after weeks of “bitter experience” with failed deliveries. 
The NHS Confederation and NHS Providers spoke out amid continuing alarm that shortages of equipment will soon have disastrous effects on the frontline, with representatives of intensive care staff warning on Sunday that the critical shortage of PPE could lead to some people refusing to continue working there."
76,health,Psychiatrists fear surge of Covid-19 cases in UK mental health units,"Mental health units could be hit with a surge in cases of Covid-19 because staff cannot get the protective equipment or testing they need, psychiatrists have warned. 
Deaths among patients and mental health personnel could potentially end up as high as in care homes, the Royal College of Psychiatrists says. 
“Without access to testing kits and the right protective equipment I fear we could see a care-home style crisis sweeping through mental health units, with many patients and staff contracting the virus,” Prof Wendy Burn, the college’s president, said. 
Much of the normal activity of the NHS’s has been suspended, and many GP and hospital appointments are being done by telephone and video links. 
Despite that, though, many psychiatrists and other mental health staff are still seeing patients face-to-face, either in community or inpatient settings, including specialist eating disorders services. They are at increased risk of contracting Covid-19 or passing it on to patients or colleagues, Burn said. 
A new survey by the college of 1,685 UK psychiatrists last week found what Burn said were “deeply worrying” flaws in the availability of both personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing for mental health staff. 
It found, for example, that almost one in four (23%) psychiatrists across the four home nations could not access the right PPE, with Scotland (29%) the country with the worst shortage. 
Only half the psychiatrists said they had been able to get a coronavirus test for themselves, and just 30% for their families. That is despite the health secretary, Matt Hancock’s, recent assurances that any NHS staff member who wanted a test could have one. 
Dr Adrian James, the college’s registrar, said: “A patient with or at risk of contracting Covid-19 is the same in all healthcare settings and they should be treated the same.  
“Not all our buildings are set up to withstand infection control and we’re hearing some real fear from our frontline psychiatrists who are putting themselves and their families in danger every time they go to work.” 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
In addition, 42 researchers from around the world, including Prof David Gunnell from the University of Bristol, have formed the International COVID-19 Suicide Prevention Research Collaboration, to monitor the potential impact the crisis has on mental health. 
Writing in the Lancet Psychiatry, the researchers say an increase in suicides is not inevitable, provided preventive action is taken imminently. 
The authors write: “Suicide is likely to become a more pressing concern as the pandemic spreads and has longer-term effects on the general population, the economy and vulnerable groups. 
“Preventing suicide therefore needs urgent consideration. The response must capitalise on, but extend beyond, general mental health policies and practices.”

People with psychiatric disorders might experience worsening symptoms and others might develop new mental health problems, especially depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress, while loss of employment and financial worries may contribute to feelings of hopelessness, the group says. 
Meanwhile, the Duke of Cambridge has backed an initiative to provide mental health support to those working against coronavirus. 
Mind, Samaritans, Shout, Hospice UK and the Royal Foundation have launched Our Frontline, a combination of support and online resources for NHS workers, carers, emergency services and key workers. 
Frontline staff and keyworkers can call or text a trained volunteer and access specially developed online resources, toolkits and advice to support their mental health and emotional wellbeing. 
Prince William said: “Over the past few weeks, millions of frontline workers across the UK have put their physical and mental health on the line to protect us all during the coronavirus pandemic. 
“Every day they confront traumatic situations at the same time as having to contend with their own worries about the risks to themselves and their families.”"
77,health,Australian health authorities ask universities to hunt down coronavirus testing material,"Health authorities have privately asked Australian universities to search their campuses for material that could be used to prevent Covid-19 testing shortages. Brendan Murphy, the chief medical officer, has warned of “extreme pressures” on Covid-19 testing kits, swabs, and the chemical reagents used to extract the genetic material critical to the testing process. Australia has now conducted more than 160,000 Covid-19 tests, a relatively high number compared to other nations. But both Murphy and the World Health Organization say a stronger testing regime, with broader testing criteria, is needed to effectively slow the spread of Covid-19. Australia’s ability to test more broadly has been hampered by pressure on the stocks of testing material available.   Related: 'Clarity and compassion': what Australia can learn from New Zealand's coronavirus response    The Guardian has learned that last week Australian universities were asked to search their campuses for stores of flocked swabs, nucleic acid extraction kits, and PCR instruments, which help amplify and detect genetic material. They were also asked to identify any capability to produce the primers and probes used in PCR instruments. Universities were asked to report back to the chief medical officer, detailing their available supplies. Correspondence from within the University of Queensland suggests its academics were doubtful they held any such supplies. “Institutions have been asked to report on stores of reagents to the chief medical officer as they are needed for Covid-19 testing, and there are shortages,” UQ’s pharmaceutical academics were told. “The faculty realises that for most, perhaps all, of you it is very unlikely you will have stores of [the] reagents in question.” A health spokeswoman confirmed the department was conducting contingency planning to deal with compromised global supply chains caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. “The department is exploring a number of possible pathology resources including through the university sector,” she said. “This is consistent with contingency planning for pandemic response when global supply chains are uncertain and may be compromised.” Universities are not the only ones being asked to supply the government with testing material. Last week, the government issued an urgent callout to industry – both in Australia and abroad – to identify companies who could manufacture swabs. Companies were asked to provide “nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs which will be suitable for Covid-19 sample collection”, tender records show. Potential suppliers were given until midday Wednesday to express their interest, and the government will immediately begin asking for quotes once the expression of interest process is complete. “The [expression of interest] will provide us with an understanding of domestic suppliers, as well as potential new suppliers internationally,” the industry department said in a statement. Earlier this month, the Guardian revealed that Murphy had written directly to GPs, warning them of the strain on supplies of testing material and personal protective equipment. “Unfortunately, the extreme pressure on our personal protective equipment stocks continues, and the situation regarding pathology test kits, reagents and swabs is deteriorating rapidly, with kits no longer being available in some regions of the country,” Murphy wrote. “Pathology collection centres have also experienced large backlogs in testing appointments in some parts of Australia, and emergency testing facilities have had to be established in some areas to ensure that urgent patients can get access to testing.” Australia has since received significant stocks of testing kits. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, confirmed that an additional 63,000 coronavirus test kits had arrived on Tuesday and almost 100,000 were received in the past week.   Related: ABC's Norman Swan denies 'rancour' with chief medical officer after PM's office intervention on coronavirus    The Therapeutic Goods Administration has also approved four companies to supply a different type of test to Australia. That test – an initial screening test – detects antibodies deployed by the body to fight the virus, and does not need laboratory process. Some experts have voiced concern about that method of testing, because antibodies only emerge some days after symptoms appear. But the TGA said its expedited approval of the testing kits was “based on evidence provided to the TGA at the time of application”, and the health department and World Health Organization say that antibody testing has merit and could prove important in tackling the pandemic. One of the companies that secured TGA approval is Melbourne-based MD Solutions, which will begin importing the tests within a fortnight. The company plans to supply about 500,000 kits in its initial shipment."
78,health,Harry has video call with parents of children with complex health needs,"The Duke of Sussex has spoken out to highlight the plight of children with complex medical needs during the coronavirus pandemic and to make it “more clear and obvious to government” that they should be classified in the “vulnerable bracket”. 
In a 30-minute video call, Prince Harry, the patron of the WellChild charity, heard that some families were struggling to get on “vulnerable lists”, had difficulties obtaining PPE (personal protective equipment) and cleaning products, and were often concerned about allowing in external care workers for fears of exposure to the virus. 
Harry, who is in California, linked up with two UK families facing challenges due to Covid-19, for the video chat which was released on YouTube. Praising them as “superparents”, he told them: “This is hard on everyone but it is especially hard on you. 
“Hopefully, through this video we can make it more clear and obvious to government and everybody else that you are in the ‘vulnerable’ bracket and WellChild needs more help.” 
 
  
  
   default
  
  
 
More than 100,000 children and young people in the UK have serious health needs. Colin Dyer, the WellChild CEO, told Harry: “These families are always isolated and hidden. Now they are more isolated and hidden than ever before. Getting recognition that they are amongst the most vulnerable people is really tough, because the focus isn’t on families like this.” 
Leanne Cooper, 37, from Lincoln, has a daughter, Sophie, 13, who has cerebral palsy, uses a wheelchair, has multiple medical needs and has a tracheostomy and so is on a ventilator. She told Harry: “It’s terrifying.” Sophie needs care “24 hours a day, seven days a week”. With the virus and lockdown, “I can’t really put into words how scary it is,” she said. 
She and her husband, Craig, have three daughters and must shield. As the manager of Sophie’s care package, she also has to make sure that there are protective measures to safeguard Sophie’s care workers, which is stressful. “If we’re in a position where carers can’t come to work because they might be symptomatic, there is no way we would survive,” she said. “And if we had no care, I don’t know where we would be.” 
Craig Hatch, 55, and his wife, Elizabeth, from Cockermouth, Cumbria, have stopped using external care workers for their son Fraser, 21, who has cerebral palsy, a chronic lung disorder and diabetes, and uses a wheelchair. The couple, who have four children, said the decision was “partly to protect the carers, and partly to isolate us”. 
 
  Related: Coronavirus UK: how many cases are there near me?  
 
Craig said: “We are frightened because we know if the virus gets into our house, and if Fraser contracts it, we know the implications are quite severe.” It was “exhausting”, he admitted, and they were worried about obtaining vital medication. 
A WellChild long-term ventilation nurse, Rachel Gregory, said of the families she supports: “They have to open their doors at this vulnerable time to external carers, which is a huge concern for them, and a huge risk, potentially. There are lots of issues around PPE. The guidelines come out, but often the supply seems to be lacking or slow to be fulfilled.” 
WellChild is wholly reliant on voluntary funding but has lost 60% of its projected income as fundraising events have been cancelled. It has set up a JustGiving resilience fund. Dyer said it was adapting and in “survival mode”. 
Harry praised the “resilience and the strength” of WellChild families, and the support they gave each other. “You are a shining example of being superparents, spinning so many plates, juggling so many balls,” he said.

Of course, there was “that fear of what might happen”, he added. “But there’s so much of this out of our control. All of a sudden we now realise how small we are in the grand scheme.” 
He told them: “There is no way you can run away from it. As long as you guys and looking after yourselves and each other, that is the best you can do.” 
Leanne said later: “It was really special he took the time to speak to us.” He was “really intently listening”, she said. “I really hope the video will shine a light and raise awareness for vulnerable families like ours.” The lack of specific advice and guidance mean that “families are feeling lost, and forgotten, and as if they have fallen through the net”, she added."
79,health,Employers warned over health and safety amid Covid-19 workers’ compensation claims,"Dozens of Australians have lodged workers’ compensation claims related to Covid-19, prompting fresh warnings that employers must take heed of their employees’ health and safety during the pandemic. Experts say employer obligations include ensuring physical distancing and good hygiene practices at workplaces that remain open. Bosses must also take steps to ensure the wellbeing of employees who have switched to working-from-home arrangements – including ensuring they have access to mental health support. Based on responses from numerous state-based agencies, Guardian Australia is aware of at least 175 workers’ compensation claims or notifications that relate in some way to Covid-19, although this figure is not exhaustive and the coverage and method of reporting may differ from state to state.   Related: Rita Wilson tells of 'extreme side effects' of experimental Covid-19 drug chloroquine    In NSW, the State Insurance Regulatory Authority said it had been advised of 153 claims or notifications related to Covid-19, including 23 where a worker had tested positive to the disease and there was a possibility work was the main contributing factor. A spokesperson for the authority said 101 cases in the “exposure” category involved workers who may have come into contact with another person – such as a colleague, customer or visitor – who was confirmed or suspected of having Covid-19. Of the remaining Covid-19-related cases in NSW, 17 were linked to mental health, while the remaining 12 were classed as other injuries or diseases. WorkSafe Victoria said it had so far received nine claims from workers impacted in some way by Covid-19. WorkCover Queensland has so far accepted six claims for work-related diagnosis of Covid-19 – five of whom contracted it while on work-related overseas travel, and one while working at a restaurant, according to the Office of Industrial Relations. Dr Stacey Jenkins, the acting head of the school of management and marketing at Charles Sturt University in Wagga Wagga, said business operators had to meet their existing health and safety obligations and bore “a responsibility to support their workers, especially in uncertain, changing times such as the Covid-19 pandemic”. “Workers’ compensation definitely does extend to Covid-19 and employers need to make sure that they prepare and manage that risk in their workplace,” Jenkins said. Implementing physical distancing was the biggest challenge for those still at work, she said.    Related: Australia's exit strategy for coronavirus    Jenkins said she was aware of construction and electrical workers who had been split into different teams and rostered on at different times, so that any outbreak could be contained and allow the business to continue operations. Jenkins said employers should remind workers of the importance of hand hygiene to avoid the spread of Covid-19 and underline the need to stay home from work if they were sick. The national body Safe Work Australia has called for people to be allowed to work from home where possible, but it noted that employers still needed to do what they reasonably could to manage the risks to someone operating remotely. It said possible new issues included physical risks from a poor work environment, such as not having a proper workstation, and psychosocial risks such as isolation, reduced social support from managers and colleagues, fatigue, online harassment and family and domestic violence. Jenkins, who is herself working from home, said an ergonomically safe work environment was important, and isolation could “prove very damaging” to mental health. While managers might feel as though making contact with a worker twice a week was enough, staff were also looking for informal methods of communication, she said. “I think that’s important and … employers have an obligation to just make sure that they are providing them with support where they can, and providing them with other resources … such as employee assistance providers or resources such as Beyond Blue.” Safe Work Australia noted that workers who sustained an injury while working from home might be eligible for workers’ compensation. While the rules differ from state to state, a worker would generally need to prove the injury, illness or disease arose out of or in the course of their employment. It is not known if any cases gathered by Guardian Australia relate to working from home. Apart from the 168 claims, notifications or accepted claims reported in NSW, Victoria and Queensland, it is understood there are at least seven cases related to Covid-19 in other states. WorkCover WA has been advised of five Covid-19-related claims, ReturnToWorkSA has received one work injury claim, and Tasmania’s Department of Justice reported that one claim had been received by an insurer."
80,health,Judge orders mental health patient to vacate bed for Covid-19 cases,"A high court judge has ruled a woman can be discharged from the hospital bed she has occupied for more than a year to relieve pressure during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Mr Justice Chamberlain ordered that the patient, known only as MB, must leave her ward at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. 
The woman, who has mental health difficulties, is the sole occupant of a side room, where she is looked after by a 24-hour registered mental health nurse. 
In his ruling on Thursday, Justice Chamberlain said the hospital stated that the need was “urgent because the Covid-19 pandemic meant that the bedroom is urgently needed for other patients” and because “it is contrary to MB’s interests to remain in the hospital, where she is at increased risk of contracting Covid-19”. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
Discussions relating to her care have been ongoing for more than a year. The hospital says the woman has been fit for discharge to specially adapted local authority accommodation, with a care package, since May 2019. It has twice tried to discharge her, but she has refused to cooperate. 
She has a diagnosis of a functional neurological disorder and psychological conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder, and a possible borderline personality disorder and Asperger’s syndrome. She needs helps with personal care, including washing, dressing and toileting, it was reported. 
The hospital issued an urgent claim last week for possession of her bedroom on a 12-patient ward. One doctor said in evidence: “We are now in desperate need of beds for patients unwell with Covid-19 and all patients who are medically fit for discharge are being discharged home or into other care arrangements that are deemed safe, as per the government’s guidance.” 
Her lawyer argued that MB did want to be discharged, but was concerned that the care package was inadequate owing to her complex needs, and that she would be at risk of suicide or self harm. 
In his ruling, the judge said that although it was distressing for the woman, it was safe for her to be discharged into specially adapted accommodation, with 24-hour care provided seven days a week. 
A UCLH spokesperson said: “Our staff have worked tirelessly with Camden council over a significant time period to ensure that our patient has a home to go to, with care suitable for her needs. UCLH welcomes the court’s judgment, particularly at a time when hospital resources are in such high demand.”"
81,health,"'National disgrace': tackle regional health inequality, PM to be told","The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, has urged the government to tackle the “national disgrace” of regional health inequalities across England. In a speech marking the 10th anniversary of the landmark Marmot review into health inequalities in England, he will say ministers should address the crisis in the budget as part of Boris Johnson’s stated intention to “level up” the country. Ashworth’s comments come as Labour figures show people who live in so-called “red wall” constituencies, the party’s former strongholds in the Midlands and the north that switched to the Conservatives in December’s general election, suffer notably more ill health than those in more prosperous areas. Noting that child poverty is a key indicator of health problems later in life, Ashworth will say the next Labour leader should make tackling this issue “a moral crusade” for the party. A decade after his 2010 report, Sir Michael Marmot, a leading epidemiologist and expert on health inequality, will address what has happened since then in an update to be published on Tuesday. A Labour analysis based on data from the House of Commons library has shown what the party describes as health disparities between former “red wall” areas and better-off ones. Comparing health outcomes in 20 red wall constituencies with those represented by the cabinet ministers Rishi Sunak, Priti Patel, Matt Hancock and Dominic Raab, the analysis found that men in the poorer areas live 5.9 fewer healthy years on average and women 7.7 fewer years. The party found deaths from cardiovascular disease was above the English average in all 20 of the sample red wall constituencies while deaths from cancer was above average in 95% of them. Above-average child poverty levels were found in 80% of the constituencies, whether or not housing costs were taken into account, while the proportion of adults and children who were overweight or obese was above the average in all 20. In his speech, Ashworth will call on the government to reverse years of spending cuts to address the crisis. “Inequality in health is the worst inequality of all,” he will say. “Surely there can be no greater social injustice than people dying sooner because of poverty and austerity? “This is a national disgrace and requires urgent government action. Boris Johnson will fail to ‘level up’ the economy if he refuses to abandon austerity and tackle these health inequalities.” Ashworth is also due to challenge Labour about being more ambitious on addressing child poverty. An analysis of the party’s 2019 manifesto by the Resolution Foundation concluded that a focus on spending for older voters meant Labour would not notably reduce levels of child poverty. “We know a child growing up in poverty is more likely to suffer ill health and in turn more likely to develop health problems in later life,” Ashworth will say. “Yet thanks to Tory cuts, child poverty is now projected to rise to the highest level since record began – higher child poverty than even the Thatcher years. “Every child matters and deserves the best possible start but instead this government condemns future generations to becoming ill quicker in life and dying sooner. Challenging these health inequalities and escalating child poverty must be a moral crusade for Labour.” The Marmot review, which was commissioned in 2008 by the then Labour government, uncovered massive “social gradient in health”, meaning that the lower a person’s socioeconomic position, the worse their health was likely to be. Calling the issue “a matter of fairness and social justice”, the report in 2010 concluded that premature deaths from health inequalities was losing an annual total of between 1.3m and 2.5m extra years of life. The economic costs of this, Marmot said, were “staggering”."
82,health,"Health, heat and deportations: the issues driving Nevada caucus voters","As Nevada prepares for the caucuses that could reshape the US presidential race, Democratic voters here remained divided on who is the best candidate to end the tumultuous presidency of Donald Trump. But across the state, Democratic primary voters agreed that making Trump a one-term president is a priority – and that their daily struggles looked very different than the experiences of voters in Iowa and New Hampshire.   Related: 'She was a warrior': Warren supporters ebullient in Las Vegas after debate    “Nevada really is representative of the rest of the country,” said Deb Lomando, a 70-year-old Las Vegas resident and retired geologist. “We are going to set the narrative for the race.” Nevada’s closely watched caucuses on Saturday will be the third vote in the primary this year, but the first in a state with a diverse population that more closely resembles the demographics of America and the Democratic party. While the first two states are 90% white, Nevada is nearly 30% Latino, 10% black and has a growing Asian American population. That makes the “first in the west” caucuses a pivotal test of the diversity of each campaign’s supporters. Recent polls have shown the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders with a sizable lead in the state after establishing himself as a frontrunner in Iowa and New Hampshire. But the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren had a particularly strong debate performance in Vegas, which has energized her campaign and could shake up the caucuses. Former vice-president Joe Biden is hoping for some kind of comeback. And Saturday will also illustrate whether the more moderate candidates from the midwest, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, can attract voters of color in the west. From Las Vegas in the south to Reno in the north, voters told the Guardian this week that the race was highly personal and urgent, mentioning the suffering caused by Trump’s deportation machine, the imminent threats of the climate crisis, the fights for labor protections and better jobs for low-wage workers, the protection of public lands and more. Lorraine Oliver, a 68-year-old public health nurse in Vegas, has lived in the US for decades but grew up in South Africa: “I’m from one of the ‘shithole countries’,” she said when asked what the race meant to her, referencing the infamous reports in 2018 of the president’s insults against a number of African nations. “It is a big affront to me. It’s an affront all of the time.”     Supporters listen next to a cardboard cutout of Senator Elizabeth Warren during a ‘Canvass Kickoff’ event in North Las Vegas on Thursday. Photograph: David Ryder/Reuters    Oliver, a Warren supporter, said the struggles of the most vulnerable patients she served are a constant reminder of the significance of this race. Whether Trump’s attacks on low-income immigrants’ access to food stamps and the rights of refugees, or his threats to deport Dreamers (immigrants brought to the US as children and protected under Obama), “It just brings you down, emotionally.” Jocelyn Torres, a 30-year-old who works at a not-for-profit, said it was stressful to even consider the possibility of a second term of the president’s anti-immigrant agenda: “Another four years of the Trump administration could completely ruin us as a community … Some people’s lives are on hold. It’s no way to live.”   Related: Bellwether caucuses: diverse Nevada is a crucial test for Democrats    In the final stretch of the race, the candidates have been spending most of their time in Vegas, which is known globally for its casino industry and is often a focal point of state political organizing. Reno, a smaller city 400 miles north of Vegas and not far from Lake Tahoe, has been seen as a crucial region in a swing state. There was less visible campaigning this week in the colder city by snowy mountains, but small groups were coordinating last-minute canvassing trips. On a break from work in downtown Reno, Tanya Duncan said the ongoing hardships facing her parents and her children moved her to vote for Sanders. The 47-year-old financial analyst is taking care of the medical needs of both her parents and said she constantly struggles to make sense of their insurance. “People who have more money are getting better-quality care. Money shouldn’t be able to buy health.” Meanwhile, Duncan’s children are both students who will be graduating with huge debts. “They are not going to be able to survive when they get out of school. It’s horrible. And it’s just not fair.”     Laynette Evans: ‘I have three children and I want them to have a big future.’ Photograph: Sam Levine/The Guardian    Laynette Evans, a 67-year-old career coach, who traveled from Reno to Vegas for the presidential debate on Wednesday, noted that the state’s two major cities are the fastest-warming in the US, a trend that has significant and sometimes fatal health consequences. “I probably won’t be around for the worst of it, but I have three children and I want them to have a big future. We’ve already lost so much critical time, which makes it so much harder to achieve what we must in order to prevent the worst.” This week, the Culinary Union, Nevada’s largest and most powerful union, received international attention with a picket outside the Palms casino resort in Vegas that drew appearances from many of the Democratic candidates. “You’re working full time, 40 hours and you don’t have enough money to pay your bills. It’s very sad,” said Victor Chicas, a 53-year-old union member, who works as a server assistant at a casino restaurant. Chicas grew up in El Salvador and came to the US in 1990 to seek asylum and flee violence in his home country. He said he wanted to see all the Democratic candidates fight to protect immigrants like him and address the daily anxieties his community faces: “We have a politician come in and do something for immigrants, and then we have another politician come in and take it away. We are in limbo. We don’t know if the eyes of immigration officers will be outside of our doors looking for us.” Rebeca Wolfe, a 34-year-old stay-at-home mother in Reno, who was knocking on doors for Warren on Thursday, said affordable childcare was her number one issue. She was on a seven-month waiting list to get her daughter, now 21 months old, a spot at a daycare. Warren’s passion on the issue gave her a feeling of optimism, she said. But if Trump wins, “There’s a lot of fear that might be amplified and turned into hopelessness.”     People wait in line to vote early at the Culinary Workers union in Las Vegas on Monday. Photograph: John Locher/AP    Latinos across Reno are united in their anxieties, she added: “Every single Latino knows someone who came here undocumented or is currently undocumented. So it’s very personal.” Tom Flynn, a 70-year-old retired surgeon also knocking on doors on Thursday in Reno, said his experience with the healthcare industry was one of his motivations for helping with voter outreach. He mentioned people in his life suffering long-term health consequences due to their inability to afford care – one friend with a lump on his neck that has continued to grow, which he can’t afford to remove; another hit by a drunk driver who was uninsured, who now can’t afford to get back surgery to fix his chronic pain and is no longer employable. The diversity of Nevada’s voters extends beyond the major cities. At the Pyramid Lake Paiute tribe, Janet Davis, 59, said she has been organizing to make sure tribal members have easy access to voting. She noted that Trump’s attacks on environmental regulations threatened the protection of her tribe’s water, and that federal budget cuts had hurt local health clinics and other programs. Davis, who was still deciding between Warren and Sanders, said she hoped to see a surge in turnout from Native American voters: “Our numbers can make a difference.” Beyond the policies that target communities like hers, she said she was also eager to see Trump gone because of the way he has eroded the basic rules and standards of his office: “It’s like it’s not really a democracy.”"
83,health,Health workers' worst fears confirmed as Covid-19 reaches war-torn Yemen,"Yemen has confirmed its first case of coronavirus, a potentially devastating development in a country where five years of war have already decimated the medical sector. 
The internationally recognised government said on Friday that a male patient had been identified in the port town of Ash Shihr in the government-controlled province of Hadhramaut, but gave no further details other than that the man was being treated and was in a stable condition. 
The local governor, Farag al-Bouhsni, said on his Facebook page that the area would be placed under a partial curfew and all workers at the town’s port would be quarantined for 14 days. Neighbouring al-Mahra province has closed its border with Hadhramaut, he added. Pictures of soldiers patrolling Ash Shihr’s empty streets were published by Yemeni media. 
Health workers and aid agencies have been dreading the inevitable outbreak of Covid-19 in Yemen, where testing facilities are almost non-existent and the virus could have a uniquely dangerous impact.

More than half of Yemen’s hospitals and clinics have been destroyed or closed during the bitter war between Houthi rebels, who control the capital Sana’a, and the Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition fighting to restore the exiled UN-backed government. The majority of attacks on civilian infrastructure have been carried out by the coalition, which is supported militarily by the UK, US and other western nations. 
At least 80% of the 28-million-strong population is reliant on aid to survive in what the UN has called the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Deep poverty, dire water shortages and a lack of adequate sanitation have already made Yemen a breeding ground for malnutrition and disease, most notably the worst cholera outbreaks in modern history. 
In an unprecedented step designed to show its awareness of the threat posed to Yemen by the pandemic, Riyadh began a unilateral two-week ceasefire on humanitarian grounds on Thursday. 
If it sticks, it would be the first nationwide halt to the fighting after several recent failed attempts, but the move has been met with scepticism by Houthi leaders. “We consider the ceasefire a political and media manoeuvre,” the Houthi spokesman Mohamed Abdel-Salam told Al Jazeera. 
Fierce fighting in al-Jawf governorate between rebel forces and militias loyal to the government, which has displaced tens of thousands of people, has sporadically continued since the ceasefire was announced. A rival Houthi offer of a ceasefire is highly conditional, and appears to apply only to Saudi Arabia, and not the Yemeni government. 
Martin Griffiths, the UN’s special envoy to Yemen, said on Friday that his office was in regular contact with both sides “on reaching agreements on a nationwide ceasefire, humanitarian and economic measures to alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people”. 
 
  Callout callout-coronavirus ""> 
 
The ceasefire announcement was cautiously welcomed by a consortium of more than 50 NGOs working in Yemen, including Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council, Tearfund and the International Rescue Committee. “We urge all parties to the conflict in Yemen to immediately halt fighting, to implement a ceasefire on the ground without delay, to release all detainees and those forcibly disappeared, and to work with the UN special envoy to urgently restart comprehensive and inclusive political negotiations to end the conflict,” the group said. 
Also on Friday, the UN’s World Food Programme said it was being forced to halve aid to Houthi-controlled Yemen because of a funding crisis. 
The UN agency is feeding more than 12 million Yemenis a month, 80% of whom live in Houthi territory. From next week, deliveries will only reach families every other month, instead of monthly. 
Some donors, including the US, have already cut funding to UN programmes in Yemen because of concerns aid has been diverted by Houthi authorities. Many aid workers have reported lengthy permit delays, harassment and detention as the rebels attempt to consolidate control over the management and distribution of resources."
84,health,Another tricky week for my mental health but a saucepan hat helped,"Monday In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, each NHS trust would send out individual emails of the number of people who had died. Now the daily totals are approaching the 1,000 mark, we are down to one global email per day. It feels as if so many people are losing their individual identity and just becoming a statistic. So to redress the balance a little, I would like to tell you about Pete, who died of Covid-19 last weekend, the first person I have known to have died of the disease. Just so that he and thousands of others like him don’t get forgotten. Pete wasn’t a close friend: more of a friend of a friend and someone my wife would join on long weekend walks. But he was a lovely man. He was at Exeter University several years before me – he took his studies so seriously, it took him four years to complete a three-year degree – but photos from that time show him as a dead ringer for Steely Dan’s Jeff “Skunk” Baxter. He was also known for driving his motorbike far too fast and for crashing cars. On leaving Exeter, he went on to establish his own communications business in Brighton and was heavily involved in several charities working in India and Africa. He is survived by his wife, Heidi, and his two children. My heart goes out to them. It’s still not clear what the rules are for funerals in the time of the coronavirus but it will undoubtedly be a scaled back affair. Sometime, when this horror is all over, we will have a party to remember him properly. And for all the many others whose deaths were merely reported as a grim number at the daily Downing Street press conference. Tuesday I found myself totally unsettled by the news that Boris Johnson had been moved to the intensive care unit at St Thomas’ hospital. So much so, that I had to switch off Twitter and stop watching the news: even though it is literally my job to watch the news. Part of the shock was that less than three hours earlier, Dominic Raab had insisted at the Downing Street press conference that Boris had only gone to hospital as a precaution and was basically still in charge of the country. So the only possible conclusion was that Raab had lied about the gravity of Boris’s condition or that, even as de facto deputy prime minister, he had not been kept in the loop. Neither of which inspired much confidence in the government. If we couldn’t trust the government to tell the truth about something so critical as the prime minister’s health, why should we trust it to tell the truth about anything else? The No 10 communications team really needs to start upping its game: we’re long past the point where serious news can be withheld for a few hours. But mostly my shock at the deterioration of Boris’s condition was on a more existential level. You can dislike his politics and think little of of his suitability as prime minister, but he is still the country’s leader. At a very basic, psychoanalytical level Boris is the country’s daddy. And no one ever wants to lose their dad, no matter how crap a dad he has been. We want our parents to be strong. Invincible, even. The last thing we want is proof that the coronavirus really is totally indiscriminate. Wednesday Finding ways of filling up the days – other than with work – is proving to be more and more of a challenge. I have had two more goes at Hilary Mantel’s The Mirror and the Light but still haven’t got the concentration to get past the first four pages. That makes it six attempts at the book so far, but it’s testament to the power of the writing that I have been gripped on each occasion. By this time next week, I am determined to make it to at least page six. My wife is rather more inventive than me and had found on Twitter the #GettyMuseumChallenge, which encouraged everyone to recreate works of art using objects they had lying around the house. After a great deal of passive resistance from me – “Why on earth would I want to do that?” – Jill persuaded me to join her as Piero della Francesca’s Duke and Duchess of Urbino.     Portraits of Duke and Duchess of Urbino, by Piero della Francesca, circa 1475, in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. Photograph: Peter Barritt/Alamy    Her costume was constructed using some lace bought from a French market some years ago, along with a pair of headphones covered with tin foil and a paper flower. Mine was made from some red felt, left over from making one of the children’s Christmas stockings, rounded off with a heavy Le Creuset saucepan for the head gear. It certainly had the necessary gravitas. Once the pictures were taken against the kitchen wall, our son Photoshopped them into the appropriate frame and we posted the diptych on Twitter and got a wonderful response from many people. Apart from the bloke who suggested I should have gone the whole hog and broken my nose like the original duke. Now our fame is to be extended further. Yesterday I got an email from a producer working on a TV film Grayson Perry is making about creativity in lockdown, requesting permission to use our photo. A Bafta surely must be in the offing. Thursday I have spent most of the football season wishing Spurs could play rather more like Liverpool and less like a bunch of bored, non-league players. And much to my surprise, I have found that I have missed the final two months of the season far less than I expected. It turns out that there are limits to my masochism and were the Premier League to announce that the final placings for this year’s season were as of the beginning of March, I’d be quite happy. If we can’t make the Champions League we can at least avoid the Europa League. Best of all, though, would be for the entire season to be considered null and void so that Spurs would automatically qualify for the Champions league on last season’s performances.  But now I find myself not just wishing Spurs would play like Liverpool but behave like them too. Earlier this week, Liverpool announced it had made an error in laying off and furloughing many of its non-playing staff and were going to retain them all. Just a week after announcing profits in excess of £70m, the Tottenham board – despite much pressure from the supporters’ trust and other interested parties – came to an entirely different decision and is laying off and furloughing non-playing staff. At White Hart Lane, the directors seem to care more about the bottom line than basic human decency. To make things even worse, the club has broken physical-distancing guidelines by holding training sessions in the park. I’ve sometimes been ashamed of Spurs’ on-field performances; now I am ashamed of their off-field ones. It’s not too late to reverse the decision. The club may be surprised at just how many fans won’t forget or forgive if they don’t. Friday     Queen: Next, they’ll be having me sing Vera Lynn Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA    There’s no getting away from it. As for many people, it’s been another tricky week on the mental health front. I miss my children more and more – I dare say I might be feeling differently about this if they were both still teenagers and going stir crazy indoors – and our frequent phone calls are bitter-sweet reminders of the distance between us. It’s the not knowing when I will next get to see them that hurts the most, and I am planning on observing government guidelines to the letter. But I did promise to try to include some good news each week, so here goes.  Boris Johnson is out of intensive care: I feel far more emotional about that than I expected. I’ve also spent the last three and a half weeks growing a beard, something I’ve never done in the past. So that’s a first. I’m not sure it’s a total success though and I doubt it will be staying much longer. My sisters have been polite about it but my friend Alex said I look like a serial rapist on death row. I’ve also now almost finished cataloguing my books, which has been mind-numbingly dull and unexpectedly time consuming as my spreadsheet skills are minimal. Next I plan to move on to cataloguing our ceramics. Soon I will be down to cataloguing the exact amount of dog and cat food we have left. But the undoubted highlight of the week has been the arrival of this year’s Wisden Almanack. I haven’t had time to more than dip in so far – Mark Lawson’s moving essay on how cricket helped his mental health was my first port of call – but the new Wisden is always a sure sign of the start of summer. Though what kind of summer it will be is still in the lap of the coronavirus. And who knows what next year’s Wisden will look like? Digested week, digested: Same again."
85,health,Health workers targeted at least 120 times in Yemen conflict – report,"Hospitals and doctors in Yemen have been targeted at least 120 times by the conflict’s warring parties, according to a report that gives the most comprehensive analysis to date of the devastating effect of war on the country’s healthcare system. There were 120 incidents across 20 of Yemen’s 22 govern​orates between March 2015 and December 2018, including airstrikes, ground attacks, military occupation, assaults on health workers and other violations such as looting and restrictions on humanitarian aid, according to analysis co-published by Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) and the Yemeni human rights group Mwatana on Wednesday. The findings come as a relative lull in the violence appears to have ended and Yemen’s already decimated medical sector is bracing for the possibility of a coronavirus outbreak. The collapse of Yemen’s healthcare system has been a major contributing factor in creating what the UN says is the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, with two thirds of the 28 million-strong population dependent on aid to survive, widespread hunger and outbreaks of cholera and diptheria. “What our report shows is how blatantly international humanitarian law has been ignored in Yemen’s conflict and how in particular attacking healthcare facilities has a long-term and wide-reaching impact,” said Osamah Alfakih, Mwatana’s advocacy director, who co-authored the report. “All the warring parties have displayed a sustained recklessness for civilian life.”   Related: In the rubble of Taiz, all roads to a normal life are blocked    Interviews with nearly 200 survivors and eyewitnesses identified patterns of attacks and specific violations that killed at least 96 civilians and healthcare workers and injured 230 more. The report could be used in future war crimes investigations against the Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition fighting to restore the exiled Yemeni government, the Iran-backed Houthi rebels and various other armed groups. Mwatana documented 35 coalition aerial attacks on hospitals, clinics and vaccination centres, which it says is “evidence of [the coalition’s] disregard for these structures’ protected status and apparent unwillingness or inability to comply with the principles of distinction and proportionality”. The report also criticises the coalition for a lack of transparency in its operations, adding that “it remains unclear what precautions the coalition has adopted to minimise harm to Yemen’s health facilities and personnel”. Among its recommendations the investigation says the UK, US, Canada, France and other countries currently facilitating weaponry and support to the coalition should immediately suspend sales contingent on respect for international humanitarian law in the coalition’s Yemen operations and comprehensive efforts to investigate alleged crimes and violations. The use of mortars and artillery by the Houthis and other non-state actors in Yemen in densely populated areas has also damaged and destroyed healthcare facilities, the report said, while Houthi occupation of such buildings pointed to a more deliberate violation of their protected status. Attacks on hospitals and clinics have closed more than half of Yemen’s pre-war facilities and the constant threat of being targeted makes it very difficult for doctors and nurses to work, Alfakih said. Al-Thawra hospital in Taiz was the target of at least 45 documented attacks by several parties, including ground-launched attacks, armed incursions and looting. In August 2015, the facility was targeted eight times and hit with 22 shells in two days. “Even those hospitals that remain open lack specialists, equipment and medicine. We currently only have 10 healthcare workers per 10,000 people instead of the standard 22. If one medical worker is arrested, injured or killed that has a huge knock-on effect,” Alfakih said. “There are very brave healthcare professionals working in Yemen right now. Even if they don’t talk about how tired they are, the toll is clear in their faces and their eyes.” The analysis of the state of Yemen’s healthcare infrastructure comes amid heavy fighting in al-Jawf province after months of relative quiet that many hoped could lead to a more permanent de-escalation in the conflict.     There are fears coronavirus could have a devastating impact in Yemen. Photograph: Yahya Arhab/EPA    Coalition airstrikes in al-Jawf launched in retaliation after the Houthis shot down a warplane killed more than 30 civilians last month. On 1 March, the Houthis seized al-Jawf’s capital, al-Hazm, sending tens of thousands of people fleeing to neighbouring Marib. On Tuesday, Saudi state media reported that the coalition destroyed two explosive-laden boats in the Red Sea launched and remotely controlled by the Houthis from the coastal region of Hodeidah. Worries are also mounting that Covid-19 could have a catastrophic impact if it reaches vulnerable communities in Yemen. This week the International Rescue Committee (IRC) launched an emergency campaign to raise $30m (£25m) to help refugees, people displaced in their own countries and those living in nations with weak health systems respond to the coronavirus pandemic. The virus could “thrive in active war zones like Yemen and Syria, putting the lives of thousands of civilians in even more danger,” said the IRC president, David Miliband."
86,health,Health secretary to investigate allegations of women denied epidurals,"The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has promised to investigate allegations that some women are denied pain-relieving spinal injections during childbirth. NHS guidelines say that women in labour can ask for pain relief at any time and should be given information and support to choose what is right for them. Epidural blocks, injected into the area around the spine, are highly effective, but they have to be given by an anaesthetist in an obstetric unit. They can lead to a drop in blood pressure in up to 14% of women, so close monitoring is important.   Related: Induction recommended for women still pregnant at 41 weeks    Some women claim that they are being denied epidurals because of what the Sunday Telegraph says is “a cult of natural childbirth” in six hospital trusts. Several claimed they were told they were either insufficiently dilated or too far dilated to have an epidural. The trusts, which included Homerton university hospital trust in London, university hospitals of Leicester trust, Surrey and Sussex healthcare NHS trust and Western Sussex hospitals NHS foundation trust, all said they endeavoured to comply with guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and give pain relief in a timely manner. Hancock said he would investigate the allegations. He said in a statement: “I want all expectant mothers to be able to make an informed choice that’s right for them, to know this choice will be fully respected and to have the freedom to change their mind. “Clinical guidance clearly states that you can ask for pain relief at any time – before and during labour – and as long as it is safe to do so this should never be refused. I’m concerned by evidence that such requests are being denied for anything other than a clinical reason. “It’s vital this guidance is being followed right across the NHS, as part of making it the best place in the world to give birth. Women being denied pain relief is wrong, and we will be investigating.”"
87,health,England ‘decade away’ from decent children mental health services,"England is “a decade away” from decent mental health services for all children despite years of government announcements, the children’s commissioner has warned. In her third annual children’s mental health report, Anne Longfield has acknowledged there has been tangible progress, but has said there remaine “a chasm” between the services currently available and what children actually need. The report, published on Thursday, highlights the continuing postcode lottery many families face, with some areas spending 10 times more than others on children’s mental health care. As a result, the chances of getting treatment vary hugely across the country. In four well-served areas, 90% of the children who are referred actually enter treatment; elsewhere fewer than half of referrals result in a child entering treatment. According to the report, 93% of children in the care of Southwark clinical commissioning group in south London who were referred to mental health services entered treatment. In contrast 64% of children referred to mental health services in Knowsley, Merseyside, did not. Waiting times have gone down slightly. On average, children wait just under eight weeks to enter treatment (53 days, down from 57 days a year ago). The report also flags up the spending gap between services for children and adults, with £225 investment on average for every adult compared to £92 for every child. “There has been welcome progress on children’s mental health services over the last couple of years, and more progress is promised over the next few years,” said Longfield. The report says an extra £60m has been invested in specialist children’s mental health services and an additional 53,000 children have entered treatment. “Nevertheless, there is still a chasm between what children need and what is being provided. More children are seeking help for their mental health and the government need to make sure that help is available. We are still a decade away from a decent mental health service for all children.” Longfield questioned whether the NHS and government were facing up to the scale of the problems in children’s mental health. “The government doesn’t have a plan for a comprehensive service in every area and there is still no commitment to a counsellor in every school, which would make a huge difference.” Many teachers are concerned they often find themselves in the frontline caring for children with mental health issues. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said government plans on children’s mental health were not ambitious enough. “There is a clear need to end the postcode lottery of provision and ensure there is a comprehensive and joined up approach to mental health support in every area. Schools have a role to play and must be part of the strategy to address the current lack of both specialist and low-level mental health services for children and young people.” The mental health minister, Nadine Dorries, said: “As the children’s commissioner highlights, major improvements to children and young people’s mental health care are already well under way, driving forward progress so every child can access the high-quality care they need and deserve. “Spending on children’s mental health is growing faster than spending overall in the NHS, backed by an extra £2.3bn investment in mental health per year. We’re rolling out dedicated mental health support teams in schools and trialling four-week waiting times in the NHS, so they have quicker access to an increased range of support and treatment when they need it.”"
88,health,Who gets a ventilator? The 'gut-wrenching' choices facing US health workers,"From ambulances to intensive care units, the Covid-19 pandemic has forced American healthcare workers to make “gut-wrenching” decisions about a patient’s fate – once rare even for hospital ethics committees. Those decisions are now made under a new paradigm – scarcity. “We’re just not used to this in the United States, where we feel like resources are always available,” said Mildred Z Solomon, the president of the New York-based Hastings Center, one of the world’s leading bioethics thinktanks. “It’s a tragedy.” Physicians in America now practice in an “exceedingly rare” time of shortages many and varied, one ethicist said. The most pressing national concern is lack of ventilators. Medical device analysts predict another 75,000 will be needed across the United States to care for the roughly 10% of Covid-19 patients who need them. But that’s not where it ends. “Ventilators are the ones that everyone hears about, but there are so many shortages,” said Dr J Wesley Boyd, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard medical school’s center for bioethics. Dialysis machines are in high demand as Covid-19 patients go into kidney failure. Doctors are low on supplies of painkillers and sedatives needed for ventilator patients, who have a deeply uncomfortable tube inserted into their mouth and windpipe. And hospitals are already rationing protective equipment and testing swabs. To deal with the unprecedented circumstance, and in the absence of federal guidance, hospitals have formed triage committees to guide life-and-death decisions. While there were instructions on how to categorize patients and allocate critical resources before Covid-19, many of these documents are no longer relevant. New York’s last state guidelines on ventilator allocations are from 2015. Now, hospital leadership is appointing new interdisciplinary teams, adapting emergency room triage, and coding patients by their likelihood to survive. “Triage will save lives,” Solomon said. “And unpleasant as it is to estimate survivability, we could end up using this equipment on people who are going to die anyway, and not offering it to people who could have been saved.” At the University of Pittsburgh school of medicine, decisions will be made by a team of one critical care specialist, an acute care nurse and an administrator. Patients’ own doctors “will not make triage decisions” and triage will not bar any patients – such as those with a pre-existing lung condition or disabilities. However, the hospital system will prioritize healthcare workers, in hopes those workers will eventually save more lives.

Photograph: Bryan R Smith/AFP via Getty Images    The prospect of triage has led many to question how older people might be treated. Patients aged 70 and older are far more susceptible to Covid-19, and many worry that will put the elderly at a disadvantage to receive life-saving care. But ethicists say that’s not the reality. They said older people could be lower priority for ventilators, but because of a higher likelihood of underlying health conditions, not age. “I hope the public will recognize these triage plans are being developed by heartbroken health professions, for whom there’s going to be tremendous suffering and [post-traumatic stress disorder],” said Solomon. While “survivability” has emerged as the most widely accepted metric for hospital ethics boards, it is not without critics. Such triage has been described as “death panels”, and some argue care should be on a “first come, first serve” basis. Others have argued that underlying health conditions of demographic groups in the United States will lead to disparate treatment in critical situations. Critics argue metrics of survivability will prioritize the healthy, and “first come, first serve” would be fairer. However, many ethicists believe this model is the “most corruptible”, and will inevitably disadvantage people with less baseline access to healthcare. “People who aren’t in the know or don’t have transportation are unlikely to be first in line,” said Solomon. Meanwhile, ethicists said they have been excluded from higher-level decision making during this “extraordinary” time. When Donald Trump took office, his administration declined to impanel a national committee on bioethics, breaking a generations-long tradition beginning with President Gerald Ford in 1974. “I believe completely that having a panel of experienced bioethicists at the disposal of the president, as President Obama, would have been helpful to the Trump administration,” said Anita Allen, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Carey law school, who also served on President Obama’s bioethics commission. For upheaval similar to that caused by Covid-19, she said, Americans would have to look back to the second world war. Boyd went further: “The response from the federal level has been appalling across every single front.” In the absence of a federal panel, which would have probably begun considering issues of scarcity as early as January, bioethicists have been left to coordinate with states, hospitals and even individual agencies on how to allocate scarce medical resources. More than 1,400 leading bioethicists urged the Trump administration to tackle this issue in mid-March, but the administration only began to heed such advice last week. Amid the piecemeal guidance, workers at all levels of the country’s healthcare system are scrambling to stretch their resources on the ground. At the center of the outbreak in New York and New Jersey, hospitals have converted anesthesia and “BiPap” machines (often used by sufferers of sleep apnea) into ventilators. Physicians at hospitals in New York City said that they haven’t yet been provided any specific new guidelines for how to triage or care for new patients. A doctor at Elmhurst hospital, the center of New York’s coronavirus cases, said he has multiple conversations with patients and their families every day about whether or not they should go to the ICU or be put on a ventilator. Pressure on local hospitals extends past the doors of the emergency rooms. EMT workers in cities such as Paterson, New Jersey, to avoid bringing people to the hospital. There, emergency medical technicians from the local fire department determine whether patients are in such severe respiratory distress that they should come to the emergency room. With the entire health system stretched to its maximum, a patient’s life during the pandemic will depend not just on triage teams at hospitals, but on every health worker in their journey along the way. “Now, we have ethics decisions at the bedside, or by the ambulance driver, or the ICU doctor in terms of when is it time to stop,” said Arthur Caplan, the founding head of medical ethics at New York University’s school of medicine in New York City. “Families are going to be seeing a loved one die – not necessarily from Covid – that normally they would not,” he said."
89,health,Ex-Obama official warns US health system faces 'tsunami' over coronavirus,"Hospitals in the US could be overrun by coronavirus cases in little more than a week, a former Obama administration senior health official has warned, fearing a “tsunami-like” escalation that would leave tens of thousands in need of inpatient medical care but unlikely to receive it. Andy Slavitt, who was Obama’s acting administrator of Medicare and Medicaid, said the trajectory of the spread of the virus in the US could follow that of Italy, which has seen cases soar to almost 20,000 and deaths exceed 1,300 in short order.   Related: Trump says he took coronavirus test and expands travel ban to UK and Ireland    The only way for the US to avoid such an explosion, Slavitt said in a series of tweets on Saturday, was for the entire population to follow a strict policy of social isolation and hospitals to reorganise and prioritise resources to fight the outbreak. “Expanding medical capacity has to be done but will only make a tiny difference if we don’t self-isolate,” Slavitt said. “I get it. Home from work. Cooped up. Crisis mentality. We need to let steam off. Shared experience. But stop that. All the bars and restaurants are closed now across Europe.” Tweets by Slavitt on Friday highlighted some experts’ expectations that more than 1 million could die in the US from coronavirus, and that early inaction by the Trump administration had fueled “a major preventable public health disaster”. “The original sin is Trump’s months-long denial and his dismantling of public health and response infrastructure,” Slavitt said. “That wasn’t all, but it led to other fatal mistakes. The public health infrastructure could have been prepared. What does that mean: nasal swabs, respirators, ventilators, RNA kits to read tests, machines, gloves…” Slavitt’s renewed warning on Saturday came as Trump appeared at the White House to outline the latest steps his administration was taking to try to contain coronavirus, including extending a European travel ban to the UK and Ireland and allocating $50bn in federal funding freed up on Friday by the declaration of a national emergency. “By 23 March many of our largest cities and hospitals are on course to be overrun with cases,” Slavitt wrote, adding that he was preparing an advisory memo for state and local officials around the US to whom he had been speaking. “They are highly dependent on the public response so I will start there. We have no immunity to Covid-19, people who get it don’t know it for a while, and each person that gets it, they infect 2+ people,” he wrote alongside a “lag tracker” graph showing the existing and predicted escalation rate of coronavirus in countries including the US, and photographs from hospitals in Italy. “Every report describes this as a tsunami. And if it happens like a tsunami, in major cities we will have tens of thousands more cases than we have beds and we will have one ventilator for every eight people who need one.”   Related: Will Trump's coronavirus travel ban work? Scientists express skepticism    Other medical experts have also warned the public to brace for an overwhelming number of coronavirus cases. “We’re about to experience the worst public health disaster since polio,” said Dr Martin Makary, professor at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health, speaking to Yahoo Finance. “Don’t believe the numbers when you see, even on our Johns Hopkins website, that 1,600 Americans have the virus. No, that means 1,600 got the test, tested positive. “There are probably 25 to 50 people who have the virus for every one person who is confirmed. I think we have between 50,000 and half a million cases right now walking around in the United States.”"
90,health,Ruffled Raab gives little clue of true state of prime minister's health,"Just about the only reassuring thing to come out of the latest Downing Street press conference was that Dominic Raab does not yet have his hands on the nuclear button. 
Because in almost every other respect the foreign secretary appeared to be cosplaying Peter Sellers in Dr Strangelove. A man so clinically unstable he has yet to realise he is by far the most dangerous person in any room he enters. 
The pathology manifests itself in different ways. Often Raab is a ball of barely repressed anger, the vein on this forehead throbbing metronomically as he tries to front out any tricky questions. 
Today, he was going for the more laid-back approach – the Mr Nice Guy who definitely had no guilty secrets. Unfortunately for him, he had more to hide than the usual collection of unsolved murders. Sooner or later, someone is going to have to have a quiet word with Dom and tell him he’s crap at this gig. Then so is almost everyone else in the cabinet. 
To be fair, Dom had been dealt a particularly bad hand. After the usual disclaimers about the government having done a generally brilliant job so far, the foreign secretary was rather obliged to give an update on the prime minister’s health. 
Something he tried to mumble away as an afterthought. Boris Johnson was in top form, excellent spirits. In fact, he was having such a good time running the country from his bed in St Thomas’ hospital that he was planning to extend his stay to an extra night. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
There was basically nothing wrong with Boris, was the message. He’d just dropped in to hospital because he was getting a bit bored at home. 
Understandably, no one was particularly convinced by Raab’s “He’s in good spirits” explanation of the prime minister’s health. After all, most people who have had even a mild version of the coronavirus have reported they were whacked out for the best part of a week and good for next to nothing. 
Yet here was Raab trying to persuade us that despite having a high temperature, a cough and breathing difficulties, Johnson was on top form and fit for anything. Being prime minister was actually a piece of piss that anyone could do from hospital. No big deal.  
“He’s in good spirits,” Raab again repeated, his eyes darting anxiously around the room. Mr Cool was now looking decidedly ruffled and he inadvertently let slip the truth. The last time he had actually spoken to the prime minister was on Saturday, the day before Boris was admitted to hospital. 
So we were asked to accept that for the last two days he had been entirely out of the loop and that Boris had been running the show on his own. Not necessarily bad news for the country, but badly credible. 
There was only one inescapable conclusion. That Boris doesn’t rate either Raab or Michael Gove as suitable deputies to run the country in his absence and reckons that he could probably still do a better job than either of them from his hospital bed. It’s a lack of trust with which most of the country has some sympathy. 
Occasionally, Raab would desperately look to the newly recovered chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the Foreign Office deputy chief medical adviser, Angela McLean, for reassurance. Which they both refused to give. Though the nation was pleased to see him back, Whitty rather looked as if he would be elsewhere. Probably visiting his second home, like the Scottish chief medical officer. That way he would have to resign and wouldn’t have to put himself through any more of these excruciating press conferences. 
Long before the end, Raab had managed to muddle up even the most basic of messages. Last week, both Boris and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had offered a glimmer of hope with a lockdown exit strategy, involving arm bands and antibody test. All that was now long forgotten as Dom pointed to some slides that showed it was far too early to be making any of those kinds of predictions. We were going backwards fast. 
A consistent display in hopelessness by the hopeless. A briefing that had only served to muddy the waters further: the Queen’s call for national unity a distant memory. For what came through clearest was that no one in government really had a clue what was happening. Even the de facto prime minister wasn’t being informed about the prime minister’s condition. 
Within hours the mirage had dropped. The press conference a total irrelevance. What Dom had or hadn’t known was immaterial. During the afternoon Boris’s condition had worsened and he was being transferred to intensive care. Dom was now acting prime minister. All that anyone could do now was put their trust in the doctors and pray for the best. The crisis had just got significantly worse."
91,health,Health experts criticise NHS advice to take ibuprofen for Covid-19,"Experts have criticised NHS advice that people self-isolating with Covid-19 should take ibuprofen, saying there is plausible evidence this could aggravate the condition. The comments came after French authorities warned against taking widely used over the counter anti-inflammatory drugs. The country’s health minister, Olivier Véran, a qualified doctor and neurologist, tweeted on Saturday: “The taking of anti-inflammatories [ibuprofen, cortisone … ] could be a factor in aggravating the infection. In case of fever, take paracetamol. If you are already taking anti-inflammatory drugs, ask your doctor’s advice.” NHS guidance states that people managing Covid-19 symptoms at home should take paracetamol or ibuprofen. “I would advise against that,” said Prof Ian Jones, a virologist at the University of Reading. “There’s good scientific evidence for ibuprofen aggravating the condition or prolonging it. That recommendation needs to be updated.” Paul Little, a professor of primary care research at the University of Southampton, said: “The general feeling is that the French advice is fairly sensible. There is now a sizeable literature from case control studies in several countries that prolonged illness or the complications of respiratory infections may be more common when non-steroidal anti-inflammatories [NSAIDs] are used.” A trial by Little and his colleagues, published in the BMJ, found patients with respiratory infections such as coughs, colds and sore throats who were prescribed ibuprofen rather than paracetamol by their GP were more likely to subsequently suffer severe illness or complications. Several other studies have linked anti-inflammatory drugs to worsened pneumonia. Little said this could be because inflammation is part of the body’s natural response to infection. “If you’re suppressing that natural response, you’re likely inhibiting your body’s ability to fight off infection,” he said. The evidence in this area was “not 100% clear” and had not come directly from studies of patients with Covid-19, Little said. “I personally think that given there is plausible evidence for harm, the advice should be changed. Should someone suffering from coronavirus with only ibuprofen in their bathroom cabinet grit their teeth and make do without? Little said despite the concerns, it would be reasonable to use ibuprofen as a last resort. For instance, if you were struggling to sleep, since getting enough rest is also important for recovery. “If you’re desperate, particularly if you couldn’t get to sleep at night,then I’d take one,” he said. Otherwise, he recommended sweating it out or asking a friend or family member to post some paracetamol through the letterbox. Charlotte Warren-Gash, an associate professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “For Covid-19, research is needed into the effects of specific NSAIDs among people with different underlying health conditions, which takes into account the severity of infection. “In the meantime, for treating symptoms such as fever and sore throat, it seems sensible to stick to paracetamol as first choice.” Public Health England said there was currently insufficient information on ibuprofen use and Covid-19 to advise people to stop using ibuprofen. “Currently there is no published scientific evidence that ibuprofen increases the risk of catching Covid-19 or makes the illness worse. There is also no conclusive evidence that taking ibuprofen is harmful for other respiratory infections,” it said in a statement. “Most people with Covid-19 will have a mild illness and some people may need to take medicines, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to help with raised temperature, headache and other pains; always follow the instructions on the label if you do take these medicines and do not exceed the stated dose. “Patients who have been prescribed NSAIDs for long-term health problems should continue to take them as directed by their healthcare professional,” the statement added. ."
92,health,Lack of PPE forces Aboriginal health groups to stop testing for coronavirus,"A number of Aboriginal health groups in Victoria have been forced to cease Covid-19 testing and consider shutting their doors due to a lack of personal protective equipment. The Guardian revealed last week that Aboriginal medical services in New South Wales, particularly in regional areas, were struggling to access the PPE needed to safely treat and test for the virus. Some clinics had just two weeks of PPE left with no immediate prospect of re-supply, creating a situation they described as “catastrophic”.     Sign up for Guardian Australia’s daily coronavirus email newsletter   The Guardian understands the NSW government has now written to the commonwealth asking for the urgent release of supplies to the state’s Aboriginal medical services and for direct access to the government’s national medical stockpile. The problem, though, is not confined to NSW. In Victoria, Aboriginal community-controlled health organisations have warned they are facing “critical” PPE shortages, which have forced some into the difficult position of stopping Covid-19 testing until new stock is provided. A number of Aboriginal health groups are making their own PPE to get by, according to the the Victorian Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation Inc (VACCHO), the peak body for Indigenous health and wellbeing in the state. Others have considered closing entirely because they cannot source enough equipment. VACCHO chair Karen Heap said the centre she runs in Ballarat – the Ballarat &amp; District Aboriginal Co-Operative – had run out of PPE and been forced to close temporarily last week. The centre was conducting Covid-19 testing for Indigenous Australians and has since re-opened. But Heap says it only has one to two weeks of PPE left. “We’ve struggled for quite a while,” Heap told the Guardian. “We’ve run out. We found a few gowns that we could use, but we haven’t got a good supply at all.”   Related: Policy backflip in lead-up to Queensland election puts youth in detention centres at risk of coronavirus    “We know we’re not the only ones asking for PPE, it’s across the nation. But we’re trying to provide a service to the Aboriginal community across Victoria and we’d like to be able to help with testing. “It just makes it easier for our community to come to our health services to get tested … they know us.” Aboriginal health services in both NSW and Victoria have been shifting to telehealth wherever possible to reduce demand on PPE and employing social distancing measures to protect staff and patients. “We’re actually in Ballarat just starting to make our own gowns as well, just in readiness, just in case we need them,” Heap said. “We’re hoping we don’t need them, but if we do, we’ve got some people in our community who can sew, so we’ve put them to task,” But Heap said if more equipment was not received soon, the consequences would be serious. “We just won’t be able to test at all and we’ll have to be very careful about who we see through the clinic, especially people with the symptoms of the virus,” she said. The release of PPE from the federal government’s national medical stockpile – a reserve of medical equipment held in secret locations across the country – is being prioritised to those who need it most. The government has identified Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as a high-risk group during the Covid-19 pandemic, because of overall higher rates of respiratory disease, heart disease, and diabetes, as well as overcrowded housing. A taskforce of experts in Indigenous health and epidemiology advising the national cabinet has released a detailed plan for dealing with the virus, which recommends urgent supplies of PPE and other medical equipment to regional and remote areas. But, in a further sign of the severity of PPE shortages among Aboriginal medical services, NSW health minister Brad Hazzard and Aboriginal affairs minister Don Harwin wrote to federal health minister Greg Hunt asking for help last week. It is understood the pair asked the federal government to urgently increase the supply of PPE to Aboriginal community-controlled health services in NSW. They also asked that changes be made to allow Aboriginal medical services direct access to the national medical stockpile – an emergency reserve of medical equipment – rather than having to make their requests through the primary health network. Such allowances have already been made for the aged care sector. A NSW Health spokeswoman said the state and federal governments were working together to “urgently increase the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) to Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services”. The state government has also provided a “one-off supply” of PPE to the sector in the week beginning 23 March, the spokeswoman said.   Related: Frontline doctors prepare for ‘death and suffering’ when coronavirus hits Indigenous communities    Hunt on Sunday announced that about 11m masks had recently been distributed to frontline workers, and that the national medical stockpile had been replenished by the receipt of 30m masks in recent weeks. A spokeswoman said 1.6m surgical and P2 masks had been distributed to the NSW government in recent days. “Significant additional supplies of masks have now arrived in Australia and the government is working with states and territories to allocate an initial additional 10 million masks to support front line healthcare professionals,” she said. “There are global shortages of masks and other PPE and the government is securing supplies to meet the demand of states and territories.” Hunt expects to make up to 200m masks available by the end of the year and finance minister, Mathias Cormann, announced an additional $800m for PPE supply on the weekend. The government has attempted to help local manufacturers to pivot into PPE production and help existing producer Med-Con to boost its output. The Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council of NSW last week warned that clinics require urgent action to boost PPE stocks."
93,health,'Reducing stigma': could mental health days help California students?,"Students in California may soon have the option of taking a mental health day. Senate bill 849, written by the California state senator Anthony Portantino, would allow students time out of school to treat or attend to mental health needs without risk of being considered truant, an infraction that could lead to penalties for students and fines for parents.   Related: ‘I broke down’: new law will let students take mental health days    Portantino, whose brother committed suicide, said in a press release that a rising number of school-age children in California are struggling with depression, anxiety or thoughts of self-harm and that he hopes the bill would make it easier for students to ask for help. “The whole focus of this effort is to reduce the stigma around seeking help and make this issue commonplace in conversations,” Portantino told the Guardian. Other states, including Oregon, Florida and Utah, have taken similar steps to allow students time off for mental wellness. Under California law, students are already excused from school for falling ill, going to medical or dental appointments, or attending funerals. The new bill would not increase the number of total days a student could miss, but it would add to the list of justified absences, excusing students “for the benefit of the mental or behavioral health of the pupil”. Music Watson, spokeswoman for the San Diego office of education, which oversees and supports more than 40 school districts in southern California, said that her office is still waiting for specifics to emerge on the bill, but that it seems in line with a larger push to boost mental health support for students – an effort that the office of education has gotten behind. “We want to make sure students get the help that they need, and have an obvious interest in helping reduce stigma and addressing the mental health issues youth are facing,” Watson said. But she said one concern for education officials is whether the bill would create an incentive to miss school more often, which could have an impact on learning and even a school’s budget. Because California schools receive funding based on student attendance, any absence, excused or not, means less money for schools. Dr Mark Reinecke, a clinical director and psychologist with the Child Mind Institute, is broadly supportive of the bill, which he said reduces stigma and encourages young people to seek help, something that could offer long-term benefits. For about three-quarters of adults who struggle with anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder, symptoms first appeared in childhood, he said. Seeking treatment earlier could be a way to head off future problems. Yet, Reinecke cautions against what he said could be “unintended consequences” of the legislation, which could increase absenteeism or even worsen symptoms for students dealing with phobias and anxiety around school. In 2016, about 8 million students in the US missed three or more weeks of school, absences that put students at risk of lower test scores and higher dropout rates. In California, a student who misses 10% of the school year – about 18 days – is considered chronically absent. Missing school for any reason counts as lost instructional time, which tends to have particularly negative impact on young children, Reinecke said. In short, the benefits of the bill would depend on how schools are implementing it. “For most teens, missing school to seek treatment would be greatly beneficial, and I think that’s the way this bill is intended,” Reinecke said. “But for children with school phobia or anxiety, missing school would be the last thing you want. It would magnify the problem.” This isn’t the first time Portantino has taken the legislative lead on issues affecting children and families. Last year, in an effort to give teenagers more sleep time, the lawmaker authored a bill to push back start times for high schools to 8.30am and middle schools to 8am or later. The bill was later signed into law. Portantino acknowledges a need to iron out specifics on the mental health bill, but said the conversation itself underscores the need for clarity in the education code. “If you sprain your ankle, we don’t ask how bad it is, or whether it justifies missing work or school. We trust the person to get evaluated and the doctor to come to an informed decision. We’re not talking about giving students an excuse to stay home – we’re talking about treating this illness as we would any other illness,” he said. The bill is set to wind its way through the legislative process. If it survives, it could head to the governor’s desk in the fall and become law no sooner than January 2021."
94,health,US national parks cause public health concern as visitors flood in,"Even as Broadway shows were shuttered and Disneyland was closed due to the Covid-19, most US national parks were open for business on Tuesday, confounding public health officials and worrying park staff who did not want to be exposed to the virus. National parks have become a haven over the past week as the public seeks places to go during spring break. One park employee reported on Facebook that a visitor center at Big Bend national park was full on Monday with hundreds of people. Another shared a photo of shoulder to shoulder crowds at Zion national park waiting to board shuttle buses. (The park closed its shuttle bus system later in the day.) The only units in the system that have closed in response to Covid-19 are Golden Gate national recreation area, the National Mall and the Statue of Liberty. National park staff who were interviewed for this story but requested anonymity for fear of retribution reported that superintendents in charge of at least two parks had requested permission from the Department of the Interior to close their units but so far no approvals have been granted. The Department of Interior did not respond to a request for comment on its park closure policy.  “Our focus is on ensuring park employees are safe,” said Grand Canyon national park public information officer Lily Daniels. Grand Canyon tourists milled around inside the park visitor center yesterday, rode shuttle buses and ate at restaurants. Daniels said that social distancing measures taken by the park include limiting shuttles to passengers who can find a seat, paying entrance fees at kiosks rather than at counters, and closing the theater inside the visitor center. “We are working in close consultation with the Centers for Disease Control,” she said. Asked about the CDC guidelines on preventing large gatherings of people, Daniels said she was not sure how many people were in the Grand Canyon visitor center yesterday. Grand Canyon is one of the most popular parks in the system with nearly 6 million visitors a year. Many national parks offer wide open spaces that are ideal for social distancing and are not inherently risky environments during the coronavirus pandemic. However, park infrastructure such as restrooms and trash cans require regular upkeep from staff in order to prevent the kind of rapid deterioration that occurred during the 2018-2019 government shutdown. Park employees from units across the country vented on social media about fears for themselves and their community. Many staff live in dorm-like quarters. One low-level park employee who cleans public restrooms wrote: “It’s not a matter of if I get sick but when.” While park employees in management positions are allowed to work from home, many minimum wage-level workers are forced to come in contact with visitors from all over the world in order to earn their paycheck. “Politicians never go to the frontlines themselves but they often decide to put others in harm’s way,” said Tom Myers, who has worked as a physician at Grand Canyon national park’s clinic for 30 years. “In this case it’s the park’s working poor, all in the name of maintaining the economy. It’s shameful.” The fact that southern Utah’s national parks and other popular federal lands are still open prompted the Southeast Utah health department to declare a “local public health emergency” on Sunday in an effort to stem the spread of coronavirus to a remote area where no cases had been reported to date. “We are concerned people will come and get sick,” the mayor of Moab, Emily Niehaus, told the Salt Lake Tribune. While Moab is internationally famous for its proximity to iconic national parks like Arches and Canyonlands, its hospital only has 17 beds. “Being a rural community, we don’t have the capacity to deal with a pandemic,” Niehaus added. It may be private concessions operators that finally push the Department of Interior to close parks as coronavirus spreads. On Monday, Eastern National, which runs retail stores in 170 national parks, announced it would no longer provide staffing at those facilities. “Our store staff are unable to maintain the social distancing that the CDC recommends in our store while serving visitors,” wrote Eastern National’s CEO, Kevin Kissling, in a memo sent to national park managers. In the Grand Canyon, private outfitters are also taking matters into their own hands. “We proactively canceled all our trips,” said Dave Logan, owner of Flagstaff, Arizona-based Four Season Guides. “We decided to do it not only for the health of our guests but also for the health of our guides. We don’t want them getting sick and then spreading the virus around in our community.” The decision is a big financial hit for Logan who depends on the popular spring break hiking season for a large chunk of his revenue. “We refunded every penny,” he said. “My company has a sense of personal responsibility in dealing with this crisis. I think everybody should.”"
95,health,Ozzy Osbourne cancels US tour due to ongoing ill health,"Ozzy Osbourne has cancelled his North American tour to undergo treatment amid a continuing period of poor health. A statement on his website says the decision will help him “to continue to recover from various health issues he has faced over the past year”. Osbourne himself said: “I’m so thankful that everyone has been patient because I’ve had a shit year. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to get to Switzerland for treatment until April and the treatment takes six to eight weeks. I don’t want to start a tour and then cancel shows at the last minute, as it’s just not fair to the fans.” Osbourne has been hospitalised frequently in recent months. In October 2018, he was treated for a staph infection, and then suffered flu and bronchitis in early 2019. As a result, he postponed the European leg of his final No More Tours II world tour to autumn 2020, having already rescheduled it once. He also suffered a bad fall and required surgery to his neck – during the treatment, he was diagnosed with what he described as a “mild form” of Parkinson’s disease, which he revealed in January. “I got a numbness down this arm for the surgery, my legs keep going cold,” he said. “I don’t know if that’s the Parkinson’s … They cut nerves when they did the surgery. I’d never heard of nerve pain, and it’s a weird feeling.” Osbourne’s wife, Sharon, had previously detailed the Swiss treatment: “We’ve kind of reached a point here in this country where we can’t go any further because we’ve got all the answers we can get here. So in April, we’re going to a professional in Switzerland. And he deals with getting your immune system at its peak.” Osbourne’s new album, Ordinary Man, is released this week, and features guest appearances from Elton John, Post Malone, Travis Scott and Slash."
96,health,Health officials 'hopeful' Australia is flattening coronavirus curve but warn against complacency,"Health authorities in Australia have expressed cautious optimism that Australia may be able to limit the domestic coronavirus outbreak, as the death toll reaches 34 including three more deaths linked to the Ruby Princess cruise ship. However, senior officials have warned against complacency or relaxing social distancing rules too early. Australia’s chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy said the number of cases in Australia rose by 139 on Sunday, to a total of 5,687 cases. About 2,000 of those cases are of people who have completely recovered. “That is probably the lowest rise we’ve had for a few days and it does tend to continue the trend we’ve seen of flattening of the curve,” Murphy said. He added: “We’re increasingly confident that if people continue to adhere to what we’ve been asking them to do we can prevent a situation like we’ve seen in many other country of the world.” However Murphy said he remained concerned about community transmission, which accounted for 10% of cases in Australia.     Sign up for Guardian Australia’s daily coronavirus email newsletter   The deputy chief medical officer, Nick Coatsworth, meanwhile said Australia appeared to be on the right path. “If we do stop these measures too early, then we have seen graphs in the media showing there could be a resurgence in cases so we have to be careful on those grounds,” Coatsworth told Sky News on Sunday.   Related: 'Like preparing for war': Australia's hospitals brace for coronavirus peak    Dr Jeremy McAnulty, NSW Health’s director of health protection, said the rate of daily infections in that state was “stabilising” but it was too early to say if this trend would continue. “It is pleasing to see early signs of stabilisation, which is down to a number of important factors,” McAnulty said. He attributed that stabilisation to an early detection of cases, allowing for early contact tracing and isolation of all known contacts, as well as adherence to social distancing measures. “We want to be hopeful, but not to over-egg the figures,” he said. “The last few days we have seen numbers bounce around without escalating at the same level as we have seen before, so we are hopeful that we are starting to flatten the curve. But there is more work to be done and it is important that we all heed those messages.” New South Wales reported 87 new cases on Sunday, bringing the total number of cases in that state to 2,580. Some 39 people with Covid-19 are in intensive care in that state, 23 of whom require ventilators. NSW has the highest rates of untraced community transmission in the country, with 380 cases recorded as having been acquired locally with no known source of infection and 58 more under investigation. About 118,863 people have tested negative to the virus . The federal government has said it will release modelling on the coronavirus outlook in Australia on Tuesday, after it is approved by the national cabinet. Modelling by the University of Sydney showed that the number of active cases in Australia, assuming continued adherence to the current social distancing laws, could peak mid-April and the spread could be controlled by July. That modelling suggested the total number of people who would contract Covid-19 in Australia over the course of the pandemic was between 8,000 and 10,000. The current number is 5,635. Victoria’s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said he for the first time had “a little bit of optimism that we can actually beat this”. “That we can take a different course than most of Europe and North America has taken,” Sutton said. “That we can avoid literally the millions of cases that will occur in North America and Europe and the tens of thousands of deaths that, unfortunately, will occur in those continents … It means staying the course in Australia, and the things that we’ve asked people to do can make a difference, and this is the very early sign of it.” Victoria recorded 20 new cases of Covid-19 overnight, bringing the total to 1,135 of which 75 were acquired through untraced community transmission. Sutton said the new cases recorded on Sunday were “likely to be a mix” of returned travellers and known contacts, and community acquired cases.   Related: NSW health minister defends experts who handled Ruby Princess coronavirus outbreak    “We’ll see a greater proportion of community transmission as our international travel proportion goes down, because those individuals are smaller and smaller in number as every day goes by,” he said. “And their secondary contacts are fewer and fewer because we’ve got people in hotel quarantine, therefore protecting others around them.” Queensland recorded just nine new cases overnight – its smallest one day rise in weeks. “We’ve got a long way to go, but these signs are very encouraging to have only nine positive cases overnight,” Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said. Palaszczuk said that more than 92% of the 907 cases confirmed to date in Queensland were either acquired overseas, or were caught from a person who had acquired the disease overseas. The Northern Territory has no confirmed cases of community transmission. It recorded 27 new cases overnight, including a child who was a close contact of a person who had travelled overseas."
97,health,Global health policy: can we manage the ever-increasing rise of diabetes?,"Together with cardiovascular diseases, cancers and chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes has become one of the world’s four major non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and one of the only chronic diseases that continues to increase in prevalence. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of people with diabetes increased from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014, and in 2016 it caused 1.6 million deaths, making it the seventh leading cause of death. The WHO estimates deaths from diabetes will increase to 2.4 million in 2030 and 3.7 million in 2045. Diabetes is a disease in which the body is unable to regulate blood sugar. Patients with type 1 diabetes can’t produce insulin in the pancreas due to an auto-immune disease, while those with type 2, once called adult-onset – as it often develops in later life – no longer produce insulin because of issues such as excessive body weight and insufficient exercise. It’s estimated that type 2 diabetes accounts for 90-95% of cases worldwide. The pharmaceutical industry is ramping up efforts to tackle diabetes through Global Health Progress, with more than 40 partnerships now researching new medicines, as well as new ways in which to diagnose and raise awareness of the disease. But what’s important, says Vanessa Peberdy, head of NCD advocacy and policy at the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), is that “the dialogue around diabetes treatment and care is not just confined to discussions on affordability and access to insulin. While this is clearly a critical issue, improving treatment and care requires a holistic approach that recognises the complexity of the condition. It needs to take in issues such as a lack of trained health practitioners, inadequate supply chains and weak health systems in developing countries.”   Related: Global health challenges: how innovative collaboration is key to tackling diseases    “Access is a complex issue,” says Helen McGuire, programme leader, noncommunicable diseases at global health organisation Path. “Failures of access in low-resource settings are rarely due to a single cause. “Barriers must be addressed by leveraging multi-sectoral partnerships, which bring the unique expertise and resources of governments, non-profits, and industry to the table. Solutions require a long-term approach addressing issues of quality, affordability, availability, acceptability, and sustainability.” Emma Klatman is a health systems specialist at the international diabetes charity Life for a Child, which is tackling type 1 diabetes in low and middle income countries, where mortality rates among young people are especially high. Living without treatment can have horrific consequences, she says, and young people are faced with “blindness, losing limbs, developing kidney problems, and they just remain chronically unwell. They can struggle to complete their education, and find employment and marriage partners, and really do face a lot of social stigma.” The charity supplies local health centres with insulin, as well as blood glucose meters and testing strips, which Klatman says are an equally important part of effectively treating diabetes. It’s a point echoed by McGuire. “Self-care is essential to meet the daily demands of managing diabetes – therefore it is critical to take a people-centered approach to designing solutions,” she says. “Co-packaging of insulin, syringes, and glucose monitoring devices and strips together at an affordable price would go a long way to support people living with diabetes to safely administer insulin and monitor their glucose levels in low- and middle-income countries.” Next year is the centenary of insulin’s discovery, and ever since its first use the pharmaceutical industry has been developing new ways in which it can be delivered to patients.     Researchers are developing new products such as smart insulin patches and pens that connect to mobile apps. Photograph: dzika_mrowka/Getty    The first insulin pen was introduced in 1985 and immediately improved the accuracy of treatment. Now researchers are exploring an oral treatment for type 2 diabetes that will mean patients no longer need to inject at all. A smart insulin patch is also being developed that delivers tailored amounts of insulin into the bloodstream, and a new generation of insulin pumps can now be connected wirelessly to a blood glucose meter or under-the-skin sensor to monitor and regulate insulin.Research into the development of an artificial pancreas at the University of Cambridge is on-going, as is R&amp;D into cell therapy, when living cells are injected into patients to take over the function of the faulty ones. Sanofi, which along with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly make up the big three insulin manufacturers, has recently changed its approach to diabetes, shifting emphasis from new treatments to helping people to use existing medicines more effectively. Working with Biocorp, for instance, Sanofi is developing a new connected pen that automatically records dosage information through a mobile app. Its MyStar DoseCoach blood glucose meter uses a dose adjustment (titration) scheme to recommend daily doses of long-acting insulin, based on daily blood sugar measurements linked to any incidents of low blood sugar through the day. Looking at the economics of diabetes, Novo Nordisk’s Base of the Pyramid programme in Kenya addresses the many barriers to diabetes care faced by people on low incomes. It takes on board issues such as poverty, geography and gender, as well as the limitations of national health systems. Cost of transport, having to miss a day’s work and the need to buy equipment such as syringes are also flagged up. Through working in partnerships across the supply chain, one of its successes has been a 75% reduction in the price of insulin. But, explains Soraya Ramoul, Novo Nordisk’s director of global access to care, the programme also showed that the price reduction in itself does not provide people with access to good care. “Diabetes is a complex condition, which requires a systemic approach to ensure basic quality care and management,” she says. “Affordability of insulin is just one of the necessary components, along with creating awareness in the communities, building capacity for care and medicine supply, educating patients, improving demand forecasting and reducing transportation costs for the patients.” Klatman sees the growth of partnerships like this as crucial to providing the level of diabetes care that is needed in developing countries, and looks forward to the day when families “are able to access insulin and other supplies without being exposed to financial risk, and having to make really tough decisions to keep their kids alive”."
98,health,"Morning mail: British PM in hospital, Ruby Princess investigation, health fund windfall","Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 6 April. Coronavirus The UK prime minister Boris Johnson has been admitted to hospital for tests after showing persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive. A Downing Street spokeswoman said: “On the advice of his doctor, the prime minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests. This is a precautionary step, as the prime minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive for the virus.” Johnson on 27 March became the first leader of a major power to announce that he had tested positive. He has been isolating in his Downing Street flat since. NSW police have launched a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess cruise ship coronavirus disaster. The ship has been the focus of intense criticism since its 2,700 passengers were allowed to freely disembark in Sydney on 19 March. At least 11 passengers from ship have now died, more than 30% of Australia’s total Covid-19 deaths. NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller said on Sunday the investigation will look at the actions of every agency involved as well as the cruise ship operator. “There’s clear evidence now when it stopped in New Zealand Covid-19 has come off that ship and at least 10 people have died in Australia from Covid-19,” Fuller said. “The only way I can get to the bottom of whether our national biosecurity laws and our state laws were broken is through a criminal investigation.” The US surgeon general has told the country to expect a “Pearl Harbour” moment in the next week, as Covid-19 deaths reach unprecedented levels. “It’s going to be the hardest moment for many Americans in their entire lives, and we really need to understand that if we want to flatten that curve and get through to the other side, everyone needs to do their part,” Jerome Adams told NBC News’ Meet the Press. Trump has already said he won’t wear a mask, but Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden said on Sunday that he would.  Italy has registered its lowest number of daily deaths from coronavirus in two weeks as the number of people in hospital with the disease decreased for the first time. Italy’s civil protection authority said on Sunday that 21,815 people had so far recovered from the virus, 819 more than on Saturday. There was also some cause for optimism in Spain, where daily Covid-19 deaths declined to 674, the lowest figure since March 26. Meanwhile in the UK, the total number of deaths approached 5,000, amid signs of strain on the country’s National Health Service. A hospital on the outskirts of London is one of the first to say a shortage of oxygen prompted them to consider prioritising which patients would need it most.

But there is more work to be done and it is important that we all heed those messages,” said Dr Jeremy McAnulty, NSW Health’s director of health protection. Australia’s private health insurance funds could reap between $3.5bn and $5.5bn due to falls in elective surgery during the coronavirus crisis. Health expert Roy Harvey said that if funds failed to pass on falls in costs, more people will flee the already struggling private health insurance system. The Morrison government has signalled that more casual workers may be eligible for jobkeeper payments than previously thought. Christian Porter, the attorney general, opened the door to allowing more of the casual workforce to access the wage subsidies – an issue that has been raised by unions, business groups and various MPs. The Queensland government has been accused of endangering children’s lives after it announced a new “hard line on youth crime” approach that aimed to place more children in detention. The policy means Queensland’s youth detention centres are almost full, and children may have to be “warehoused” in adult watch-houses during the pandemic.

Recommended reads     ‘We need to temper our responses and restrictions based on the evidence we have and what is occurring in our communities.’ Photograph: Mark Metcalfe/Getty Images    There is no evidence to support the over-the-top laws put in place in NSW and Victoria in response to the coronavirus, infectious diseases physician and microbiologist Peter Collignon argues. “We need everyone to continue to comply with the rules we put in place mid-March and will likely need to do so until at least September. Some states have now put in overzealous rules and ones that give very mixed messages or have little biological plausibility. Not only will this cause unwarranted and increased social, mental and economic harm, we run the bigger risk that a substantial part of our society in a few months’ time might increasingly rebel against many restrictions.” One of the biggest puzzles of the Covid-19 pandemic is that it routinely hits the oldest hardest, but occasionally it strikes down young, apparently fit individuals, including medical staff exposed to patients with the virus. In some cases, previously undiagnosed conditions are later revealed but in others no such explanations are available, leaving scientists struggling to find reasons for the behaviour of the coronavirus. Robin McKie questions whether our DNA might play a role, or whether some people are subjected to a higher viral load than others.

99,health,UK universities issue health warnings over travel to China,"UK universities with links to China have issued warnings to staff and students travelling to and from areas affected by the coronavirus, urging anyone with symptoms to seek medical advice. With concern growing about the spread of the virus, universities in the UK are keeping a check on staff who have recently returned from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, as well as Chinese students who come from affected areas, many of whom will be concerned about loved ones at home. China has become an increasingly important partner in UK higher education in recent years, with 120,000 Chinese students enrolled in UK universities last year and numerous partnerships and collaborations between universities in the UK and China. Nine UK institutions have partnerships with Wuhan University in Hubei Province in central China, among them Dundee University which runs an architecture course in collaboration with Wuhan. In an email to students, the university urged anyone who had travelled to affected areas and was suffering symptoms to contact their GP by phone, avoid crowded places and alert the people they live with. Dr Jim McGeorge, university secretary and chief operating officer at Dundee, also warned students to take care if receiving packages from areas where the virus is present, especially if a package contains food items. Experts believe the virus has come from animals, possibly seafood. In the case of the Dundee-Wuhan university partnership, Chinese students complete their first four years of study in Wuhan, and come to Dundee for their fifth and final year, often choosing to remain in the Scottish city to complete their master’s degree. A statement from the university said: “There are currently 34 students from the programme in Dundee, having arrived in September 2019. There have been no health concerns raised among that group but we will continue to monitor the situation closely.” The Chinese architecture students are among 900 students from China currently on the Dundee campus, of which 104 matriculated in January with a further 48 due to arrive later this month or next. The university confirmed that five members of staff returned from a visit to Wuhan last week, but there were no current health concerns. The University of Glasgow, meanwhile, has a partnership with the Zhongnan University of Economics and Law in Wuhan. A total of 23 Chinese students are in the final two years of their degree in the school of mathematics and statistics. “We can confirm that all our Chinese students on this programme are currently studying at the university and in good health,” a spokesperson said. Aberdeen also has a partnership with Wuhan University. “The university is aware of five members of staff who have visited Wuhan during the outbreak, four of whom returned to the university three or more weeks ago,” a spokesperson said. “The remaining member of staff has a non-teaching role and is working from home as a precautionary measure.” Newcastle University hosts around 300 students who have links with Hubei province. “We are writing to them all to remind them to follow the health protection advice and to offer support to any student concerned about themselves or loved ones,” a spokesperson said. The university has also arranged a special health advice event for students arriving from China in the last month, to ensure they register with a doctor. “In line with Foreign and Commonwealth Office advice, the university is advising that staff and students don’t travel to this area,” a spokesperson said. Since the cap was lifted on the number of students able to study at UK universities in 2015, the sector has worked hard to increase recruitment from China. According to the most recent data, published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency, the number of Chinese students studying in UK higher education institutions exceeded 120,000 for the first time last year, a 13% increase on the previous year and up from fewer than 90,000 in 2014/15. Liverpool University has one of the biggest Chinese student populations. It too has issued guidance to any student currently in or planning to travel to China in the immediate future. A statement on the university website said: “We would advise our students to avoid travelling to Wuhan if possible and follow basic hygiene rules including regular hand washing; maintain good personal hygiene; avoid visiting animal and bird markets, avoid people who are ill with respiratory symptoms [and] seek medical attention if you develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days of visiting Wuhan, either in China, or on return to the UK.” Birmingham University also confirmed that students from a range of partner universities in Wuhan City are currently studying in the city. A spokesperson said those students would have travelled to the university months ago and the risk of infection was low."
100,health,NMC Health reveals it has almost $3bn debt unknown to board,"Troubled hospitals provider NMC Health has revealed it has almost $3bn more debt than it previously realised, as it continues to investigate an accounting scandal. The FTSE 100 firm, which is based in Abu Dhabi and runs private hospitals in the Middle East, said it had discovered more than $2.7bn in debt facilities which the company’s board was not aware of and had not approved. It is in addition to the $2.1bn of debt it reported in June 2019. The company, which is listed in London but headquartered in Abu Dhabi, said in a statement: “NMC is continuing to work with its advisers to understand the exact nature and quantum of the undisclosed facilities. The board believes that some proceeds may have been utilised for non-group purposes.”   Related: Bank of England must issue firm instructions to soften the coronavirus fallout    The group has been in crisis for more than a month since it revealed accounting inconsistencies, including revelations over the ownership of shares, and has asked its lenders for an “informal standstill” on its debt payments to avoid a cash crunch. Shares in the firm have been suspended from trading since the end of February, amid the expanding accounting scandal.  The financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, opened an investigation into the company’s finances at end of the February, after the shares were suspended and the firm fired its chief executive, Prasanth Manghat, and granted its chief financial officer, Prashanth Shenoy, “extended sick leave”. The clearout at the top of the company came after a board-commissioned investigation by the former FBI director Louis Freeh found that the company had entered into $335m of secret financing arrangements that were used by entities controlled by Bavaguthu Raghuram Shetty, the founder and co-chair of the company, and Khaleefa Bin Butti, another of the main shareholders. The turmoil at the group was triggered after a December report by short-selling hedge fund Muddy Waters, which said it had concerns over asset values, cash balance, reported profits, and reported debt levels, as well as possible fraud and theft. NMC denied those allegations. NMC has hired investment bank Moelis &amp; Company, accountancy firm PwC and lawyers Allen &amp; Overy to advise on discussions with its lenders, and manage the company’s finances."

102,health,"It was wrong to play against Atlético, says Liverpool's public health director","Liverpool’s Champions League tie at Anfield with Atlético Madrid should not have been played, the city council’s director of public health has said, amid concern at the rising number of confirmed coronavirus cases there. Matthew Ashton, who began in the role on Wednesday, is responsible for coordinating the response to the unprecedented challenges of the pandemic while having to work from home, as confirmed cases in Liverpool rose to 262.   Related: My favourite game: Liverpool v Arsenal, Premier League 2004    “It was not the right decision to stage the match,” Ashton told the Guardian, although he said he was not critical of the scientists or medical officers whose advice informed the government’s approach of allowing sporting events to continue. “People don’t make bad decisions on purpose – perhaps the seriousness of the situation wasn’t being understood across government at that time. “Although we will never know, the Atlético Madrid game could have been one of the cultural events and gatherings that influenced the rise in Liverpool. It is definitely one to be included on the list for learning and for a future inquiry, so that organisations can learn and not make similar mistakes.” On 11 March, the day of the last-16 second-leg match, which was won 3-2 by Atlético and attended by 54,000 people, including 3,000 away supporters, Liverpool had just six confirmed cases of coronavirus. Madrid had by then become a centre for the spread of the virus. La Liga decided that day that all matches must be played behind closed doors and Spain’s government had ordered schools closed the day before. In Britain the government was still pursuing its policy of allowing life to continue with no restrictions other than advising people who believed they had Covid-19 symptoms to self-isolate.     Fans gather to greet the Liverpool team coach before the game. Photograph: Rich Linley/CameraSport via Getty Images    Dr David Halpern, chief executive of the governmental behavioural insights team, first publicly mentioned the term “herd immunity” that day, suggesting that the majority of the population could be allowed to contract Covid‑19 while people most vulnerable to the virus might be isolated. All major events such as football matches, described as “mass gatherings”, were still scheduled to go ahead. The government changed the policy and began to announce social distancing restrictions the following Monday, 16 March. Joel Rookwood, a senior lecturer in sport business management at the University of Central Lancashire, and a Liverpool supporter, has been suffering severely from the symptoms of Covid-19 since 14 March, although he has not been in hospital so has not been tested for the virus. He was at the Atlético match, and believes he contracted the virus at the game. Writing about his experience in his local newspaper, the Lancashire Evening Post, Rookwood, 39, said he had feared he would be vulnerable if he contracted the virus because he has twice been hospitalised with pneumonia. For days since the match he has suffered from “acute shortness of breath and violent episodes of rigor (shaking). I haven’t eaten solid food or been fully horizontal for 10 days. Precious periods of sleep are counted in minutes, not hours.” He did call 111 last weekend when his condition deteriorated, but was told he was 280th in the queue for an ambulance, and he was not considered critical enough for that to be accelerated.

Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA    Scientific advice to the government at the time of the match, and the way it was communicated by ministers, made a distinction between “mass gatherings” outdoors, which are said to involve a lower risk of infection, and people meeting inside, in pubs and bars, where the risk of transmission is greater. That appeared to overlook the glaring reality that a mega-event such as Liverpool’s Champions League game involves multiple intense indoor gatherings as well; the old Victorian pubs around Anfield were packed for hours that night, as were the club’s bars, shop, concourses, toilets, entertainment and working areas. Even out on the Kop, Rookwood points out that on such a tumultuous football night there was a great deal of close contact. Yet despite the pandemic beginning to take hold in Britain then, he recalls no allowances being made for it: “There were queues and groups everywhere. Pubs were packed, friends greeted each other with the customary contact, fans gathered in condensed queues and stood or sat together in close proximity … The celebrations that night were very physical, shared experiences.” Prof Neil Ferguson, leader of the Imperial College team of scientists advising the government, said that their advice on mass outdoor gatherings did acknowledge that people would also gather indoors at pubs and bars. “The issue is that people spend a very small amount of their time during the week at a mass gathering. It is not that mass gatherings don’t contribute at all [to the spread of a virus] but that at a population level, stopping them has a marginal impact.”     The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.    The issue of allowing Madrid supporters to travel was a separate government decision about restrictions from any particular country – which did not apply from Spain at the time, Ferguson said. “Some people will have got infected,” he said of the transmission potential of mass gatherings, “and if it hadn’t happened they wouldn’t have been.” However he maintains that stopping sporting events, rather than closing schools and maintaining the very restrictive measures now in place, would not have had “a major impact on the spread of the epidemic”. Prof John Ashton, the former regional director of public health for north-west England – who is Matthew Ashton’s father – sounded the alarm about the government’s approach and staging the Liverpool match at the time and he maintains it was wrong to host it. Accepting that without widespread testing the real number of Covid-19 cases is unknown, and it is impossible to be sure where people were infected, he says, nevertheless: “Bringing 3,000 supporters from a very high-incidence area was basically just wrong, and the view that open-air events don’t pose a threat is really simplistic. I hope I am wrong, but I believe that people were put in harm’s way that night.”"
103,health,Coronavirus: WHO steps back from declaring public health emergency,"The World Health Organization has stepped back from declaring the growing viral pneumonia outbreak in China to be a public health emergency of international concern, saying its expert committee would meet again on Thursday to discuss more evidence from its teams on the ground. “This is an evolving and complex situation,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO. “Today there was an excellent discussion but it was also clear that to proceed we need more information. “The decision is one I take extremely seriously and one I am only prepared to make with appropriate consideration of all the evidence.” More than 540 people have been taken to hospital with breathing difficulties and 17 have died, all in Hubei province, the Chinese authorities said on Wednesday. Many more are thought to have developed a milder form of the illness. UK infectious disease experts have doubled their estimate of the likely number of cases during the coronavirus outbreak to 4,000. The WHO’s emergency committee met as the international spread of the virus became clear, following the diagnosis of cases in people who have travelled not only to other regions of China but also abroad. There have been cases in Thailand, Japan, South Korea and most recently, the United States. The coronavirus is from the same family that caused 800 deaths globally from Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2002-03 and Mers (Middle East respiratory virus), identified in 2012. The UK government said on Wednesday morning it was implementing checks on travellers arriving from the city of Wuhan, but within hours, it became clear that the three direct flights a week to Heathrow would not be arriving. Chinese state media announced that Wuhan was shutting down outbound flights and trains. The official Xinhua News Agency said people had been asked not to leave Wuhan without specific reasons. The People’s Daily newspaper tweeted that no one would be allowed to leave the city from 10am on Thursday and that train stations, the airport, city buses, subways, ferries and long-distance shuttle buses would be temporarily closed. Members of WHO’s emergency committee, who praised China for its openness in sharing data and information, said that in circumstances where a new and infectious virus was circulating, they would recommend that mass gatherings should be avoided. Responding to the public transport ban, Dr Didier Houssin, chair of the committee, said: “We need some time to understand the specific measures that have been taken.” The WHO team in China would be reporting overnight on developments. The committee said that the virus is mostly affecting older people, with 73% of patients over the age of 40. Nearly two-thirds (64%) are male and 40% of those who have died had underlying conditions that made them vulnerable to a new virus, such as heart disease or high blood pressure. This was typical of the coronaviruses, they said. The fatality rate so far appears to be lower than either Mers, which kills a third of those who get it, or Sars which has a death rate of around 10%. The new coronavirus has been linked to a market selling seafood and live animals in Wuhan, which has now been closed. The type of coronavirus has never been identified before and it has been confirmed that human-to-human transmission is taking place.  Experts believe it is quite possible the disease, which causes coughing, fever and breathing problems, will arrive in the UK. It can take at least five days for symptoms to show. If flights resume, the airport checks may not pick it up, but will serve to alert people to the need to get medical attention if they fall sick. Prof Neil Ferguson’s team at Imperial College London, who carry out disease modelling for the WHO, said they had increased their estimate from 1,700 cases at the end of last week to 4,000. However, they say there is considerable uncertainty and the true number could be between 1,000 and 9,700. “You should not interpret that as the epidemic doubling in size in five days,” Ferguson said. The increase was due to more information coming out of China, where doctors were struggling to deal with a rapidly evolving situation. “All the reports I have read from within China [suggest] that hospitals are now overwhelmed with suspect cases.” The confirmed cases tend to be the more severe ones, in people who end up in hospital. It is possible there are many more mild cases, which do not get reported but maybe more easily transmitted from one person to another. “It is vital we understand the rate of human-to-human transmission,” he said. “That will determine the feasibility of control and what measures will need to be taken.” Peter Horby, a professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the University of Oxford, said there was “quite a long latency” after infection before serious symptoms show, starting with a mild fever and a dry cough. “After about a week or so, they develop shortness of breath and then severe respiratory distress. About 15 to 20% of hospitalised cases are severe, requiring oxygen or ventilation.” Experts say the spread of the coronavirus fulfils the criteria for the WHO to declare it of international concern. “Personally, I think this is a big event,” said Horby. “Is it extraordinary? Yes, it pretty much is. We haven’t seen this large-scale spread since Sars.” The Chinese authorities were criticised for failing to share information about the Sars epidemic which began in China in 2002 but spread globally. There have been around 2,500 cases of Mers, which is far less transmissible, mostly in Saudi Arabia. “This is a new and rapidly evolving situation where information on cases and the virus is being gathered and assessed daily. Based on the available evidence, the current risk to the UK is considered low. We are working with the WHO and other international partners, have issued advice to the NHS and are keeping the situation under constant review,” said Dr Nick Phin, the deputy director of the National Infection Service at Public Health England. “Individuals should seek medical attention if they develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days of visiting Wuhan, either in China or on their return to the UK. They should phone ahead before attending any health services and mention their recent travel to the city.” Public Health England has shifted its risk assessment slightly from “very low” to “low”, but, said the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, “obviously we want to stay ahead of the issue so we are keeping a very close eye on it”. The UK Foreign Office has updated its advice for Britons travelling to China, warning the virus had spread to other areas outside Hubei province."
104,health,Dreamers on the frontlines of the coronavirus health crisis work in limbo,"Jesus Contreras tore into his breakfast sandwich after getting off a 24-hour shift as a paramedic in the Houston area of Texas. He had got maybe 15 minutes’ sleep the night before. Contreras, 26, is on the frontline of the US response to the coronavirus pandemic, a health crisis of epic proportions. But he is also one of an estimated 29,000 people in healthcare occupations who rely on an Obama-era immigration policy to shield them from deportation, according to a forthcoming analysis from the Center for American Progress (Cap). Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or Daca, allows undocumented “Dreamers” who came to the United States as kids to work legally and live without the constant looming threat of immigration enforcement officers knocking on their doors.   Related: Easter tirade: Trump attacks Nafta and says 'No more Daca deal'    As the supreme court considers whether to greenlight his and hundreds of thousands of other potential deportations during this global pandemic, Contreras believes that getting rid of so many healthcare workers and other talented individuals when the country desperately needs them doesn’t make sense.  “From a heartfelt perspective, it’s like, you know, betraying us despite all the things that we’re doing. From a logical perspective, it’s just counterintuitive,” he said. Many of these roughly 650,000 young people have grown up almost entirely in the US and are deeply rooted in their communities. Contreras, for example, moved to Texas when he was six years old and has lived in the Houston area for two decades. Daca has allowed more than 3,000 registered nurses, almost 5,000 nursing and home health aides and about 4,000 medical assistants to enter their professions, among other healthcare fields, Cap found. Nearly 200 of the program’s beneficiaries are medical students, residents or physicians, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). Donald Trump has been adamant about ending Daca, a goal that’s been stalled for years because of drawn-out court battles that have finally landed in front of the supreme court. Now, the country’s foremost justices are in the process of concluding whether the Trump administration can legally move forward with its plans to rescind the policy, or if that action is even judicially reviewable. Oral arguments took place in November. Their decision is due at any moment. Daniel, a 32-year-old registered nurse in New Jersey who asked to use only his first name because he feared retaliation at work, has sometimes worried about being able to financially support his loved ones if he could no longer renew Daca. His mom just lost her customer service job because of how the pandemic has ravaged the economy, adding even more pressure. And yet he’s soldiering on, working shifts in an intensive care unit, where he said the majority of patients are Covid-positive, intubated and ventilated. As he described what it’s been like to treat people with Covid-19 – controlling their vital signs, increasing their oxygen, watching for frowns or other pain indicators – his voice is strained. “It’s tough,” he said. “I mean, it’s very sad.” A lot of nurses and doctors are getting sick, he said. One of his fellow nurses told him she cried before her shift because they were shouldering too much work. Like other medical personnel, Daniel is worried about having to wear the same PPE for 12 hours and then saving it to potentially reuse in the future. And he is concerned that he’ll bring the virus back home to his family. But unlike other medical personnel, he also has to think about the very real possibility that someday soon, he may not be able to do his job at all. “I’m in a career to help people,” Daniel said. “But because of my immigration status, it just puts me in a limbo.” Once US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) gets the go-ahead from the court, it intends to start deporting Dreamers, the agency’s acting head said earlier this year. “I can only imagine what that must feel like, to be putting your life literally on the line for a country, and for the wellbeing of the residents of a country, that isn’t, hasn’t decided whether you’re gonna be allowed to stay there,” said Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. Without Daca, Dreamers will lose the protection that has let them “build a life in the US”, said Camila Bustos, a law student intern with the Jerome N Frank Legal Services Organization. And, though their wider contributions to society shouldn’t trump their humanity, they will also lose their work authorization, she said. A hit of that magnitude to the country’s healthcare workforce could be “potentially devastating”, the AAMC argued even before Covid-19 came to the US. But especially in the context of a global pandemic, as states plead for more healthcare professionals to outfit overwhelmed hospitals, attorneys and advocates are asking the supreme court to consider their ruling’s potential ramifications. “We’re saying, side with immigrant young people,” said Bruna Sollod, communications director at United We Dream, an immigrant youth-led organization. “Side with the folks who are on the frontlines of this. Side with the folks who are hurting and really in danger of getting sick, in danger of losing their jobs. In danger of not providing for their families.”"
105,health,How to find health funds that align with your values,"If you have ever stopped to wonder what your service providers are really doing with your money, you’re not alone. Research shows many of us are trying to make more conscious choices, thinking about our impact and what we want from life. More and more, we’re asking businesses such as our banks and super funds to better align with what we want, and to invest in things we can feel good about, that make a real and positive difference. We also want insurance that we can trust and a health fund that understands where we’re at in life. The start of the year is a great time to evaluate your health insurance, shop around and optimise your life. And if you find a better fit, making the switch is easy. Here’s how to choose a health fund that’s the perfect fit. 1. Know where you’re at Products and the services covered by health funds can be vastly different, and what suits someone else may not be right for you. Life may have changed significantly since you joined your current fund years ago, or maybe you have just stayed with the same provider as your parents. Either way, before you switch, think about who you are and where you’re at. Maybe you’re considering having a baby, or about to start a new job. You might want a health fund that complements your active lifestyle, or one that supports a specific community.     Knowing what you need is the first step to finding the right fund for you. Composite: Getty Images     Knowing what you need is the first step to finding the right fund for you. Composite: Guardian Labs/Getty Images.  2. Be clear about what’s really important Not all health funds have the same priorities. Health funds that are not-for-profit or part of a not-for-profit group are able to put members first. On average, Members Health funds keep narrower margins and invest more of your paid premiums back into benefits. For-profit funds, on the other hand, have to maximise profits for investors and shareholders. Funds that make up Members Health return a higher proportion of member premiums back in benefits – on average it’s 91%. It’s no surprise that this is reflected in high satisfaction and high trust levels from members, who are also more likely to stick around. The health fund you choose can also have an impact on your community. Some Members Health funds are based in regional areas and support local charities, sporting clubs and health services. Or, they might be industry-based; for example, a fund that’s tailored for teachers, police, military, doctors, bank employees, transport and energy employees, emergency services, nurses or others. All these factors might influence your choice. 3. Think about what you want your fund to deliver Health funds that are run for people, not for profits, are designed to give back to members, which can mean a better overall experience for you. Look for options that will have a direct benefit: - Customer service: support that’s available and genuinely wants to help - Quality products: policies tailored to your individual health needs and stage of life, offering a combination of good-value prices, coverage and benefits - General wellbeing and preventative health: such as offers on dental, optical, osteo, chiro, physio and remedial massage - Complementary coverage: other high-quality insurance products, such as travel insurance - Convenience: digital tools, fast claims processing, and a caring person to speak to when you need it most - Strong values: a fund that aligns with your life, and puts you first No matter what insurer you decide to go with - big or small - all Australian health funds provide access to healthcare services across the entire country. 4. Do your research More information is available than ever before. If you’re looking at an industry-specific health fund, ask colleagues for their experiences. Funds run for people, not profits, can deliver better value while being tailored to members’ needs. Website aggregators can help you compare your options. For example, the Members Health site allows you to filter funds by relevant criteria so you can find and research funds from one place - including some you may never have heard of. Once you’ve got a shortlist, it’s worth contacting a fund directly to quiz it on what it offers and how it will give back to you.     There are funds with benefits and options specific to your occupation. Composite: Getty Images     There are funds with benefits and options specific to your occupation. Composite: Guardian Labs/Getty Images.  5. Find a fund that will grow with you As we move through the different stages of life, our health care needs change. It’s only logical, then, for you to regularly review your health insurance to ensure you’re adequately covered. That said, switching funds every year is extra admin you don’t need, so the best choice is the one that adapts to your life - whether you’re adding or removing extras, adjusting coverage levels or transitioning children onto or off your policy. Certain fund benefits can be good for your wallet, too. Some health funds run their own dental and optical clinics, or have preferred provider arrangements in place. Some offer loyalty rewards programs, and some have increased claim limits for services such as dental, optical and physiotherapy. 6. Choose a fund that understands you Having so many options makes it easy to find a fund that wants what you want. When you work hard in your profession, you want companies that understand your unique needs, challenges and goals. Some health funds are run and owned by members from inside an industry or community, so they really get you. There are funds with benefits and options specific to your occupation. Maybe you or your family are in the emergency services or defence, or working as teachers or miners. Perhaps you’re in transport or banking, or a health profession. You’ll also find funds with great benefits and options that are run by members of regional communities. With 27 Members Health funds to choose from, there is bound to be a health fund out there to suit you. You might opt for a health fund that’s focused on corporate social responsibility, pays out higher than average benefits or is a proactive contributor to your community. 7. Stay on top of your choice of fund Health funds regularly update their products and services to provide better options for members, so it pays to shop around. Do a regular health cover check: - Review your policy’s restrictions - Make sure you understand any exclusions, excesses and co-payments - Check that you’re on the most suitable plan, getting good value for money and not paying too much Before you spend another year with a fund that’s not quite right, find a Members Health fund that’s exactly what you need."

107,health,Health officials contact 200 including MPs over UK coronavirus scare,"More than 200 people, including several MPs, have been contacted by health officials over fears they could have been exposed to the coronavirus at a conference in central London. 
Public Health England (PHE) wrote to those who were at the UK Bus Summit at the QEII Centre in Westminster on 6 February after it emerged one of the delegates had tested positive. 
“One of our main priorities has been to identify any people who we think have been in close contact with confirmed cases of Covid-19 to provide public health advice, as they may be at slightly increased risk of catching the virus,” said Dr Yimmy Chow, a consultant in health protection at PHE. 
“While the degree of contact conference delegates may have had with the case is unlikely to have been significant, we have taken a precautionary approach and informed them of the situation.” 
Two of the MPs who attended the conference said they have decided to stay at home after health officials advised people who may be suffering to self-isolate. 
Lilian Greenwood and Alex Sobel, the Labour MPs for Nottingham South and Leeds North West, both said they were feeling well but had decided to cancel appointments, in line with health officials’ advice. 
The Transport Times bus summit is an annual event, but one that attracted more enthusiastic delegates this year to the heart of Westminster after major political parties raised buses up their agenda. Before and during the day-long conference, about 250 delegates mingled over refreshments among exhibits in the small adjoining Cambridge Room. 
As well as transport minister Lady Vere and senior civil servants, delegates came from across the UK, including from Transport Scotland, Transport for London, major bus and rail operators, manufacturers, councils and thinktanks. A sizeable delegation came from Lagos and there were representatives from Heathrow airport and MacMillan Cancer Support, whose service users are most at risk from the virus. 
The news comes amid growing concerns about the spread of the virus within the UK. As of Friday, a total of 2,964 people have been tested in the country, of which 2,955 were confirmed negative and nine positive. In China, where the virus originated, the number of deaths from coronavirus has reached 1,523, with more than 66,000 recorded infections, in figures announced early on Friday morning. 
It also emerged on Friday that a Channel 4 employee was among those being tested for coronavirus after feeling unwell following a trip to Asia. A Channel 4 spokesman said: “As a precautionary measure, they decided to seek medical advice and, in line with the latest public health advice regarding the coronavirus, they were taken to hospital for a precautionary test.” 
Later the same evening, Facebook said it was cancelling its global marketing summit, which was due to take place in San Francisco next month, because of coronavirus concerns. 
As many as eight flights at Heathrow airport were said to have been caught up in delays or checks as a result of government health officials responding to coronavirus-related concerns over passengers feeling unwell. 
United Airlines confirmed that staff in London had been providing assistance to a flight from San Francisco which had landed at Heathrow following reports of an individual becoming unwell onboard. 
A man who had been on the flight said a passenger had been taken to the back of the plane ahead of the arrival of health officials before passengers were allowed to disembark after half an hour. 
“There was an initial announcement that someone had taken ill and would be taken off,” said Andy West, a public relations executive at Hotwire, said. 
“Shortly afterwards he said that there was a suspected case of coronavirus and that the passenger had been isolated at the back of the plane.” 
West said the pilot had said that there were seven other planes at Heathrow experiencing similar issues, including a number in front of it on the tarmac which were due to be visited. After disembarking, passengers were asked to complete a form and were questioned about their recent travel history and symptoms.

“There was no sharp intake of breath when the pilot made the second announcement but I think that a lot of people, including myself, were a bit anxious and probably worried. I really hope the person doesn’t have it and that if we don’t hear anything then no news will be good news,” he said. 
The United Airlines flight which was affected was United flight 901, according to the US airline. 
Heathrow airport, which was unable to say how many flights had been affected, said that the airport was operating as normal. It added that PHE were managing Coronavirus-related issues on the ground, which may require some aircrafts to be slightly held up when disembarking. 
A Heathrow spokesperson said: “We are working closely with Public Health England officials to facilitate their access to the airport so that they can implement their enhanced monitoring measures as a precaution. 
“In line with the latest Public Health England advice, we are encouraging passengers and colleagues to maintain good hand hygiene and report any suspected symptoms to NHS 111.” 
 
  
  
   
    
    The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.
    The UN agency&nbsp;advises&nbsp;people to:
    
     Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap
     Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing
     Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough
     Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers
     Advice about face masks varies. Wearing them while out and about may offer some protection against both spreading and catching the virus via coughs and sneezes, but it is not a cast-iron guarantee of protection
    
    Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.&nbsp;
    In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;stay at home for at least 7 days.
    If you live with other people,&nbsp;they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.
    
   
  
  
 
PHE said it was not commenting on individual situations and activities at airports but added that it was carrying out “enhanced monitoring” of direct flights from China, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and Macau. This is in addition to the usual public health response to someone becoming unwell on a plane from any destination. 
Enhanced monitoring includes early warning by a pilot of any passenger illness as soon as possible and formal assurance by the captain on the health of passengers prior to disembarkation. 
Virgin Atlantic said it had not been affected by the reports at Heathrow on Friday. British Airways, the airline with the largest number of flights using the airport, was also approached for comment. "
108,health,"More than 1,700 health workers infected by coronavirus in China","The World Health Organization is seeking more information from China about the large numbers of health workers falling sick because of the coronavirus after it was revealed 1,760 of them have tested positive and six have died. 
This is the first time China has included the specific numbers for healthcare professionals in the data it has provided on the spread of the epidemic. “This is a critical piece of information because health workers are the glue that holds the health system and the outbreak response together,” said the WHO’s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. 
 
  
  
   
    What is Covid-19?
    
    Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.
    
    What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?
    
    According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment.
    About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.
    In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:
    
     a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back
     a new continuous cough - this means you’ve started coughing repeatedly
    
    As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.
    
    Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?
    
    Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.
    In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.
    
   
  
  
 
“We need to know more about these figures, including the time period and circumstances in which the health workers became sick.” 
On the same day, Egypt reported a case, making it the first country in Africa to do so. The country’s health ministry said the affected person was a foreigner who had been put into isolation at hospital, adding that the WHO had been immediately informed and that all necessary preventative measures had been taken. It did not give the nationality of the affected person or any other details. 
Earlier this month the WHO said it was particularly concerned about high-risk nations with weaker health systems that may lack the facilities to identify cases. 
Doctors and nurses in China are having to adopt makeshift measures to try to protect themselves in the face of dire shortages of protective gowns, gloves and masks, according to the New York Times. Eyewitnesses told of health professionals patching up damaged protective masks with tape and reusing goggles meant to be used once and thrown away. They are wrapping their shoes in plastic bags because they have no protective covers for them. 
Some have used their own money to buy protective gear if they could find it for sale, or begged from friends. Others told of avoiding eating and drinking for long stretches because going to the toilet meant removing and discarding safety gowns that they would not be able to replace. 
Tedros pointed out that the WHO had disseminated its guidelines for protecting health workers to China and other countries with Covid-19 cases, but the critical problem in coronavirus-hit Chinese hospitals appears to be obtaining protective gear. 
On Friday, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said that it would send 3.5 tonnes of medical protective equipment to Wuhan Jinyintan hospital— one of the hospitals at the forefront of treating patients with the virus. 
The lockdown in China’s cities is intended to stop the virus travelling but has impeded the production and delivery of essential supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) and masks and glove, while donations have not always got through to where they are most needed. 
WHO is already seeking more information from the Chinese government about the change in the way doctors are now diagnosing Covid-19, which led to a big surge in diagnoses numbers on Thursday. An extra 15,000 cases were reported from the centre of the outbreak, Hubei province, who had all been diagnosed by a CT scan of their lungs and not a lab test. 
On Saturday the National Health Commission announced the total number of cases in China stood at 66,492. Deaths from the virus stood at 1,523. The total cases included lab-confirmed Covid-19 and clinically diagnosed cases by doctors. Tedros said they needed to know doctors were not misdiagnosing other infections as the coronavirus. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
“While it is not uncommon in outbreaks for clinical definitions to change over time as more information becomes available, we are seeking further clarification on how the clinical diagnosis is being made, to ensure that other respiratory illnesses including influenza are not getting mixed into the Covid-19 data,” he said. 
US experts will be part of an international team that will arrive in China at the weekend to hold talks with their counterparts, the WHO said. The confirmation followed calls from a senior White House official for Beijing to be more transparent over its handling of the outbreak and its change in the reported data, as Chinese authorities expanded “wartime” measures to limit its spread. 
“We’re a little disappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese,” said Larry Kudlow, the director of the US National Economic Council. 
China’s national health commission’s vice-director, Zeng Yixina, confirmed that more than 1,700 Chinese medical workers had been infected and six had died, adding that the commission was “highly concerned about this issue” and had issued guidelines for the prevention and control of infection within medical institutions. 
Healthcare workers accounted for about 3.8% of confirmed cases as of three days ago, Zeng said.  
The death toll stands at 1,383. Three deaths were outside of mainland China: in Hong Kong, Japan and the Philippines. 
Singapore confirmed nine new cases on Friday, bringing its total to 67, while in Japan, the health ministry said 11 elderly passengers on the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess were allowed to leave the vessel after they tested negative.

While public health experts have greeted the change in reporting positively, others say it raises more questions about the data. The change in diagnostic criteria has been applied only to Hubei province. 
“Is the politburo really being honest with us?” Kudlow asked, referring to communist China’s top leadership body. Kudlow said President Xi Jinping had assured Donald Trump that Beijing would accept US help, but “they won’t let us”. 
“I don’t know what their motives are. I do know that apparently more and more people are suffering over there,” he said. 
At a meeting of senior leaders in Beijing on Thursday, officials called for other areas to “adopt quarantine and rescue measures equal to that of Wuhan”, which has been under lockdown for the past three weeks. The meeting, chaired by the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, called on Wuhan to speed up classifying and quarantining residents suspected or confirmed of contracting the virus.  
In Huanggang, one of the worst-hit areas outside of Wuhan with more than 2,000 cases and at least 59 deaths, authorities issued emergency measures for 14 days, “fully sealing” all residential areas and banning vehicles, except those for emergency, medical or official purposes. 
Checkpoints would be set up and public security deployed to enforce the measures. Local district committees are to organise residents’ food and supplies. “All residents must not enter or leave their communities without authorisation,” the notice said.

109,health,"Tributes paid to health worker, 84, who died nine days after last shift","Tributes have been paid to an 84-year-old healthcare assistant who died from coronavirus 10 days after her last shift, as the hospital trust that employed her said it was reviewing its approach to allowing staff at a higher risk from the virus to continue working. Margaret Tapley died in the early hours of Sunday at Great Western hospital in Swindon. The last of her regular night shifts was on 10 April on Linfoot ward at Witney community hospital in Oxfordshire.   Related: Doctors, nurses, porters, volunteers: the UK health workers who have died from Covid-19    Oxford Health NHS foundation trust said she “embodied all that is best in those who work for the NHS”. The trust’s chief executive, Stuart Bell, described her as “a legend on the ward, and more widely throughout the whole hospital”, and said it was remarkable that she had stayed on to support her colleagues for so many years. “Margaret knew coronavirus posed a risk, and if she had wished she would have been perfectly justified in self-isolating, but she wanted to continue in her role, doing the job she loved,” Bell said. Asked later by the Guardian about its processes in relation to staff such as Tapley, the trust issued a statement in which it said it had discussed risks with any staff member who might be at particular risk from coronavirus because of their age or other vulnerabilities, to ensure they knew they had the option to self-isolate away from work. It said that if someone still wanted to continue working, it would undertake an assessment to help them do so as safely as possible and to ensure they were suitably supported and had the right protective equipment. The trust added: “We know that there is a difficult balance to be struck here and we are looking closely at whether that is something we can or should continue to do.” Tapley’s grandson Tom Wood, a nurse, paid tribute to her in a Facebook post. “This phenomenal, committed, kind-hearted fighter was my grandmother and I am so hugely proud of her,” he wrote. “She was my inspiration and a huge reason as to why I am a nurse today. She took huge pride in her work but was so humble. She embodied the nursing spirit. For anyone who worked with her or knew her, that spirit that we all saw and felt lives on in us.”       Among other health workers who were the subject of tributes after succumbing to Covid-19 was Patrick McManus, a nurse in Stafford described as an “exceptional leader”. Tracy Bullock, the chief executive of University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS trust, said McManus was an “extremely well-liked and valued member” of the nursing team at County hospital in Stafford. She said: “He had been a nurse for more than 40 years and had worked at North Staffordshire Royal Infirmary prior to working in Stafford, where he had been for about 10 years.” Chrissie Emerson, a healthcare assistant at Queen Elizabeth hospital in King’s Lynn, was described on Monday as a “valued colleague” as well as a “much-loved wife” and “cherished mother and grandmother”. Northampton general hospital NHS trust said Joanna Klenczon, 34, a domestic supervisor, “will be missed by everyone who knew or worked with her”."
110,health,Melbourne professor quits after health department pressures her over data breach,"A prominent university professor has quit after the health department pressured her university to stop her speaking out about the Medicare and PBS history of over 2.5 million Australians being re-identifiable online due to a government bungle. In 2016, Vanessa Teague, a cryptographer from the University of Melbourne, and two of her colleagues reported on a dataset, published on an open government data website by the federal government, of 2.5 million Australians’ Medicare and PBS payment history dating back to 1984 that had supposedly been de-identified so people were anonymous. Teague and her colleagues reported that the dataset had several samples where people were able to be identified.   Related: Australian government officials accused of 'cavalier disregard' for unauthorised metadata access    In the research, they came up with seven examples where they were able to determine who the data was about based on publicly available but relatively unique information about that person – such as their birthday, dates of birth of their children, and other personal information. Once they had that, the researchers had a trove of their entire medical history, including medication purchases and tests conducted. Teague informed the government about it and the data was removed, but it was downloaded around 1,500 times in the six weeks it was online. Additionally, the dataset is still found easily online and the government appears to have taken no steps to have it removed. The breach so shocked the government, the then attorney general, George Brandis, quickly announced plans to criminalise the act of re-identifying previously de-identified data, although ultimately the legislation never passed before the 2019 election. In September 2018, Teague went back to the department and alerted them to a TV journalist’s data she had found in the dataset, and asked the department to notify them, or she would inform that journalist in 30 days. Teague also asked the department to inform all 2.5 million Australians in the dataset that their personal information was potentially compromised. Instead, the health department secretary, Glenys Beauchamp, wrote to University of Melbourne vice-chancellor Glyn Davis to complain about Teague’s demands, stating there were significant “practical and legal barriers” preventing the department from identifying people in the dataset and then notifying them. Beauchamp also requested Teague cease her work on the dataset. “We trust the university … continues to place great importance in respecting the privacy of the individuals included in the MBS/PBS dataset and request the university cease the work currently being done to attempt to re-identify individuals and destroy all copies of the dataset,” Beauchamp said. “We also request the researchers not publish the names of individuals the researchers assert have been re-identified, the de-anonymisation methodology or other information that would potentially assist in the ease of re-identification.” The letter also raised concerns about a conference presentation on the methodology Teague ultimately ended up giving after the letter was sent. But 18 months on Teague has now left University of Melbourne, pointing to this letter as the beginning of the end.   Related: Internet privacy: the apps that protect you from your apps    “The letter hints strongly at negative consequences for the university as a whole, particularly if I notified the affected journalist. The university did pass on that pressure, quite unambiguously, but I can’t really blame them.” Teague has now published the letter after filing a freedom of information request on the website Right To Know. “I did what I thought was the good citizen thing … the result was the very aggressive letter you have now seen,” Teague told Guardian Australia. “I was really astounded at the magnitude of the reaction. I didn’t understand why the VC needed to get involved at all, I don’t understand why they didn’t get back to me if they had a problem. It didn’t seem like a big deal.” Teague said the reaction was centred around discouraging notifying people in the dataset. “My strong feeling is all of the 2.5 million people should know. It can’t be rolled back now that it’s out on the internet. There are still decisions they can make that can be informed about the data that is out there.” She said although she quit, the university was pressured by the department over her research. “The uni has to make some kind of decision about trading off the obvious necessity of staying on the right side of the federal government with its funding and its health datasets, versus standing up for [academic freedom],” she said. “They were really stuck in a hard place, which they shouldn’t have been put in, I feel. I think that’s all I want to say.” A spokesman for the health department said the letter was sent because of the health department’s concerns about Teague re-identifying people in the dataset, and claimed the department did not have a responsibility to notify the 2.5 million people in the dataset. “The dataset does not contain the personal information of patients. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner found that the department did not breach Australian Privacy Principle 6 of the Privacy Act 1988 with respect to the personal information of patients,” the spokesman said. The OAIC argued that the risk of re-identifying people in the set was low. Teague said it doesn’t bode well for the debate on whether the intimate and personal data governments hold on every person is the property of those people, or if it is the government’s data and up to the government to decide how to use. A spokeswoman for the University of Melbourne said the university could not comment on staffing matters but said researchers were supported by the university’s academic freedom of expression policy. “A core value of the University of Melbourne is to preserve, defend and promote the traditional principles of academic freedom in the conduct of its affairs, so that all scholars at the university are free to engage in critical enquiry, scholarly endeavour and public discourse without fear or favour,” she said."
111,health,Breathwork and gig buddies: Lewis Capaldi launches fan mental health scheme,"The corridors at arena gigs are usually abuzz with pre-show anticipation and thronging bar queues. Prior to Lewis Capaldi’s performance at Glasgow’s SSE Hydro on Thursday night, there were pockets of calm as fans undertook breathwork classes to learn how to stay centred in a crowded space. Capaldi, the UK’s bestselling musician of 2019, has rolled out Livelive, a pioneering mental health initiative for gig-goers attending his arena tour. After the 23-year-old Scottish star openly discussed his own history of panic attacks in interviews, he received dozens of messages from fans thanking him for speaking publicly. This influx of support and shared experiences of panic and anxiety convinced Capaldi and his team that coming up with such an initiative for his biggest shows to date was essential, said Livelive co-founder Jack Williamson. “People were saying, ‘Thank you – I feel less alone.’ Or, ‘I have social anxiety and that’s stopped me from coming to your shows.’ One in 10 people have anxiety, and we saw that there was an opportunity for us to provide that support for people.” Livelive offers an email support service so fans can inquire about facilities prior to a performance. One hour before doors open, Capaldi posts meeting points for a gig-buddy system on Instagram, designed for solo gig-goers to find company. A help desk in the foyer promotes awareness and points people towards longer-term resources. Behind this, a quiet space is set aside for anyone feeling overwhelmed. Medical staff and trained mental health professionals are on hand to provide extra care.     The team at Lewis Capaldi’s Livelive initiative at the Glasgow SSE Hydro arena. Photograph: Ryan Johnston    Fan Kevin, 23, said: “Lewis is such a legend for doing it, honestly. It’s something that society needs and he’s at the forefront.” Inspired by the work of Attitude Is Everything, a charity that improves accessibility for deaf and disabled people at live performances, Williamson says the team behind Livelive want mental health support at gigs to become an industry standard. While their research indicates that Livelive is the first initiative of its kind at this scale, it builds on work being carried out across the arts to make venues more accessible, from relaxed performances in the theatre to dementia-friendly cinema screenings. This weekend’s BBC 6 Music festival in Camden, London, features a designated relaxation space with quiet music and beanbags. The logistics behind Livelive are complex. Undertaking background checks, safeguarding and policy work is time-consuming and expensive, although Livelive works with volunteers from mental health organisations local to each performance. At a smaller show in Manchester earlier in the week they collaborated with 42nd Street, a mental health charity that offered support to young people following the Manchester arena bombing. In Glasgow some volunteers came from local social enterprise LifeLink.     Lewis Capaldi in concert at the SSE Hydro, Glasgow. Photograph: RMV/Rex/Shutterstock    An extra 50p has been added to ticket prices to fund the scheme. Still, the budget remains tight, and Livelive provides any additional funding, said Williamson: “With economies of scale, it will get easier to do.” He argued that there was a strong business case for this kind of initiative: “We did initial research on Lewis’s socials and 83% of respondents out of 232,712 people said that if this kind of support was available at other shows, it would increase the likelihood of them purchasing a ticket. To see that kind of interest is fascinating, and to see that it could increase turnout and financial generation too.” Finding a suitable space for the initiative within a crowded arena can be difficult. For the Glasgow performances, venue sponsors were invited to volunteer to give up their place in a private lounge in order to accommodate the scheme. Colin Banks, head of sponsorship at SSE, said the response was positive. “It gives you back some faith in the human race.”   Related: Lewis Capaldi: ‘They’re screaming America’s sweetheart at me. It’s wild’    Fans attending the Glasgow show welcomed the scheme. Taylor, 20, said: “I know Lewis suffers from [anxiety] so it’s great that people can come here and get that support. I have anxiety myself, and knowing that the support is here makes all the difference.” Angela, 59, had not heard of the scheme prior to the gig: “The more people who know about it the better,” she said. “It’s great that people are talking about this kind of thing.” Ryan, 28, agreed. “I saw it on his Instagram. My little brother doesn’t like coming to gigs but this would definitely help.” Williamson is confident about the longevity of Livelive. He confirms that the scheme has been in talks with other musicians in the UK and US about creating similar initiatives for their tours, as well as with other venues and promoters across the country. “Ultimately I don’t care who does it as long as it gets done,” he says. “In an ideal world this support would be available at any venue. Even if it only helps one person, it’s worth it.”"

 Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: 
  
  Global death toll passes 142,000 
  The total number of coronavirus deaths across the world has reached 142,735, according to Johns Hopkins University, which has tracked the spread of the virus during the pandemic. 
  The US has the highest number of deaths, with more than 33,000, followed by Italy, which has passed the 22,000 mark, and Spain, which has recorded more than 19,000 fatalities. 
  Across the world, the total number of coronavirus cases has reached more than 2.13 million. 
  Trump announces guidelines to end US lockdown 
  Donald Trump has announced guidelines for individual states to reopen on different schedules. 
  At his White House briefing, he said: “We’re opening up our country … America wants to be open … our experts say the curve has flattened and the peak in new cases is behind us.” 
  The president added: “We must have a working economy and we want to get it back very quickly, and that’s what’s going to happen.” 
  UK government minister’s father died from pneumonia ‘brought on by coronavirus’ 
  Greg Hands tweeted in tribute to his father, who he said died on Monday with Covid-19. The trade minister paid tribute to the “brilliant grammar school scientist” and “determined man”, adding that he would be “sorely missed”. 
  Hands, the MP for Chelsea and Fulham in west London, shared the tribute after taking part in the applause for NHS workers on Thursday night, calling the moment “especially poignant”. 
  Captain Tom to ‘keep on going’ 
  Captain Tom Moore, the 99-year-old war veteran pacing his garden to raise money for the NHS, says he will continue completing his laps despite passing his 100-lap target. 
  Moore originally aimed to raise just £1,000 for NHS Charities Together, but has now raised almost £16m. He completed his final lap on Thursday but tweeted to say he planned to “keep on going”. 
  Police discover 17 bodies in US nursing home 
  Police have found 17 bodies in one of New Jersey’s largest nursing homes after an anonymous tip said a body was being stored in a shed. 
  A total of 68 people associated with the Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation Centers have recently died, with 26 having tested positive for coronavirus. 
  Officers found no body in the shed, but said the facility’s tiny morgue was “overwhelmed”, holding 17 bodies. It is unclear how many of the deaths were due to Covid-19. 
  US business funding programme runs out of money 
  A US small business lending programme set up to help companies affected by coronavirus has run out of money. The Small Business Administration said it was unable to accept new applications “based on available appropriations funding”. 
  It had been given the task of managing the $349bn (£280bn) programme that grants loans to businesses so that they can pay their employees. 
  Saudi Arabia pledges $500m to support efforts to tackle coronavirus 
  Saudi Arabia, the current G20 chair, said it has pledged $500m to support global efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic and urged other countries and organisations to help bridge an $8bn financing gap. 
  Riyadh said it would allocate $150m to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation, $150m to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations, and $200m to other health organisations and programmes.  
  France death toll increases by 753 
  France registered 753 more deaths from coronavirus infections on Thursday, bringing the total to 17,920, the fourth highest tally in the world. But the number of people in hospital declined for a second day running. 
  Jerome Salomon, head of France’s public health authority, said the total number of people in intensive care units fell for the eighth day in a row, to 6,248 – the lowest figure since 1 April. 
  At 17,920, the number of fatalities is up 4.4% over 24 hours, with the rate of increase decelerating again after it had increased the two previous days. 
  Brazil’s president Bolsonaro fires health minister 
  Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has sacked his health minister, Luiz Mandetta, after a standoff between the two men over radically different views of the pandemic. 
  Mandetta tweeted on Thursday: “I have just received notice of my dismissal from President Jair Bolsonaro. I would like to say thank you for the opportunity that was given to me, to manage our health service … and to plan our fight against the coronavirus epidemic, this great challenge that our health system is about to face.” 
  Mandetta has defended social isolation while the far-right president insists the impact of the pandemic on Brazil’s struggling economy is more important than loss of life. 
  Putin delays Victory Day anniversary celebrations 
  Vladimir Putin has delayed Russia’s celebrations for the 75th anniversary of Victory Day due to the coronavirus outbreak. 
  Russia’s president said: “The risk connected to the epidemic, the peak of which has not passed, are still dangerously high. And that doesn’t give me the right to begin the preparations for the parade and other mass events.” 
  Putin did not set a new date for the parade, which had been scheduled for 9 May, but promised it would take place this year.

  Trump is asked about the thousands of protesters in cars and on foot who have flouted Michigan’s stay-at-home orders to demand the state reopened.  
  Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer was the main target of armed pro-Trump protesters, with some chanting ‘lock her up’ on the steps of Lansing’s town hall. Whitmer responded hours after the protest saying she understood the frustration but the ‘sad irony’ about the demonstration was that it could have further spread the virus and therefore created the need to extend Michigan’s stay-at-home order. So far, 1,900 Michigan residents have died due to the coronavirus.  
  Trump’s response:

  Trump says there are 29 states that will be able to reopen “relatively soon”. He doesn’t name any of them.

  Questions have begun.  
  Trump is asked whether he heard from any governors today that they are ready to re-open. He did, Trump replies. There will be “good news” in the next few days, Trump says.  
  Trump says he spoke to the commissioners of “every sport” yesterday, which seems far-fetched. He’s talking about whether sporting venues can be re-opened - Dr Fauci has just spoken about this saying eventually it will be possible – in phase 3 – but not at the same time for everyone.  
  Trump echoes this, but in a less measured way:  
   
   
    Trump: I spoke to sports commissioners, and many of them will start without fans; ""Made for television. The good ole days."" (?) He says there'll then be space between fans; then, ""when the virus is gone, we'll be back to normal."" (We haven't heard this stuff from the commishes)— Daniel Dale (@ddale8)

  Dr Anthony Fauci, the leading US expert on infectious diseases, is speaking now.  
  No matter what phase you’re in (referring to the phases of reopening detailed by Dr Birx), there are certain fundamental things that mist be done that are not like before - “If you want to call it the new normal, fine.” 
  
 
 
  11.42pm BST  
  
  Before the US can consider reopening, there needs to be robust testing, especially for health care workers, and indications that the number of infections is decreasing for at least 14 days. 
  “We want every state to have a plan to protect the health and safety of its workers,” Birx added — states and counties need to also surveil and monitor cases among nursing homes and other vulnerable populations, she said. 
  Dr Birx is outlining the phases of reopening: 
  Phase 1: Schools that are closed should remain closed, people should not be able to visit aged care facilities and some elective surgeries can resume. Non-essential travel should be avoided, people should work from home where possible.  
  Phase 2: Non-essential travel can resume, telework is still encouraged. Schools, daycares and camps can reopen. Visits to senior living facilities prohibited. In-patient and out-patient surgeries can resume.  
  Phase 3: Returning to new normal. Continuing with good hygiene practices, respect for space between individuals.  
  
 Updated at 11.43pm BST 
 
 
  11.39pm BST  
  
  Dr Birx says the task force will be doing “sentinel surveillance” in nursing homes, inner city clinics, and indigenous populations to find early alerts for asymptomatic and syndromic cases.  
  As far as I’m able to understand it at the moment, sentinel surveillance means testing and other measures to ensure early detection among vulnerable populations.  
  But it’s not immediately clear:

  “America wants to be open and Americans want to be open,” Trump says. 
  Of course, it’s hard to argue that we don’t want to get back outside, back to work, and reunited with friends and families who live away from us. But a Pew research poll published today found that “Americans say their greater concern is that state governments will lift restrictions on public activity too quickly (66%) than not quickly enough (32%).” 
  
 
 
  11.29pm BST  
  
  The new guidelines were released about an hour ago. They don’t include a deadline, which is a relief – this means for now states are being allowed to reopen as they are ready.  
  There is a handy thread with the guideline slides below:  
   
   
    The discussion starts with the pre-conditions. They contain the right elements but need to be more specific (how many cases, how many tests needed, how to pay for contact tracers, how much PPE).

  Forty-four Guatemalans deported on a flight from the United States this week have tested positive for COVID-19, a Guatemala government official said. 
  The flight arrived in Guatemala’s capital on Monday from Brownsville, Texas carrying 76 Guatemalans.  
  Three deportees displaying coronavirus symptoms cough and fever were taken for testing.  
  When one of those tests came back positive, more who had been quarantined at the airport were tested and 43 more resulted positive, said the official who requested anonymity. 
  Presidential spokesman Carlos Sandoval said the official total number of infected deportees remained at five.  
  “We’re going to check with the Health Ministry,” he said.  
  “For the moment I can only confirm the cases the (president) has said. I wouldnt know what to say, I cant even say no, but I also can’t confirm it.”

  Mid-sized and larger businesses in the UK with a turnover of more than £45 million will be allowed to access funding through a new government scheme from Monday, according to the British Business Bank. 
  Chancellor Rishi Sunak said companies can apply for the loans from lenders accredited by the banking group, through the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS).  
  Bosses with sales between £45 million and £250 million can apply for the short-term loans and financial support of up to £25 million if they have been forced to shut down operations or been impacted by the virus shutdown. 
  Larger businesses with sales of more than £250 million can also take the support. However, if they access CLBILS they will be unable to use the Bank of England’s Covid Corporate Financing Facility.

  A mother who gave birth nearly two weeks ago in New York while in a coma and suffering from coronavirus has finally met her baby son Walter. 
  Yanira Soriano, 36, had difficulty breathing while having contractions when 34 weeks pregnant and tested positive for Covid-19. 
  Doctors put Soriano in a medically-induced coma so they could place her on a ventilator. 
  Walter was delivered through an emergency caesarean section while she was unconscious. 
  Dr. Benjamin Schwartz, who delivered Walter, told US TB station ABC7 News: “In most instances you’re awake when you deliver the baby and you can bond with the baby right away. 
  “But because the mother was so ill, she had to be put on a ventilator and put to sleep right before the baby was born.”

  Albania has amended its penal code on to punish anyone breaking coronavirus quarantine and self-isolation rules and infecting others with up to eight years in jail as it slowly prepares to restart sections of its economy. 
  Critics of the tougher measure said fines were proving effective but prime minister Edi Rama defended the new penalty as necessary for successfully relaxing the lockdown. 
  Rama said the government believed about 2,800 people would have died if lockdown rules had not been imposed.  
  As of Thursday, 26 people have died and 518 have been infected with the coronavirus among Albania’s 2.8 million people.

  Spain’s coronavirus death toll soared past 19,000 on Thursday with another 551 deaths, but questions over the counting method have raised some regional concerns the real figure is much higher.  
  After nearly five weeks of confinement, the rise in deaths and infections has slowed over the past fortnight, with the overnight fatalities taking the toll to 19,130.  
  But regional authorities in Madrid and Catalonia said they each had thousands more victims than the official count. 
  Fernando Simon, the health ministry’s emergencies coordinator, said: “The real number of deaths is difficult to know.” 
  The daily figure was compiled from information provided by regional authorities concerning deaths among patients who “had tested positive for coronavirus”, he added.  
  Between them, Madrid and Catalonia account for 56 percent of the national toll, but some officials say the numbers are flawed for not including all those who have died outside of hospitals. 
  Madrid has counted 6,877 deaths but on Wednesday a top official said the true figure was likely to be more than 10,000.  
  In Catalonia, where 3,855 people have died, the real number could be higher than 7,000, prompting the regional government to announce changes to its counting method.

  Poles will also have to cover their noses and mouths in public until a coronavirus vaccine is found, health minister Lukasz Szumowski announced. 
  While the reopening of parks and forests from April 20 will be welcomed by those stuck in lockdown, many restrictions look set to continue into May, when a presidential election is due. 
   “These steps ... do not mean the epidemic is over,” Szumowski said. 
  “We are going to have to learn to live with the epidemic for ... a long time.” 
   In addition to reopening green spaces, Morawiecki said limits on the numbers of people in shops would be eased. He said he planned to ease the lockdown further every week or two.

   A Downing Street spokesperson said: “They agreed that the rapid development and production of coronavirus treatments and a vaccine will be crucial to stop the spread of the virus around the world. 
   “The First Secretary of State stressed the need for the response to be internationally coordinated. 
   “Leaders discussed the particular risk coronavirus poses to developing nations and agreed on the need to fight coronavirus in every country.  
  “They committed to continue to support developing countries through bilateral assistance, multinational organisations and by ensuring governments around the world have access to the medical supplies they need.” 
  Experts have suggested a vaccine for coronavirus could be 12 to 18 months away.  
   Downing Street added: “G7 leaders also agreed on the importance of financial measures to defend the global economy against the impact of coronavirus.” 
  With Johnson recovering from the impact of coronavirus, the Downing Street spokesperson said: “All leaders expressed their best wishes for the Prime Minister’s recovery and welcomed the cooperation that has already taken place between G7 countries.”

  A total of 68 people associated with the Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation centres have recently died, with 26 having tested positive for coronavirus. 
  Police did not find a body in the shed but said the facility’s tiny morgue was “overwhelmed”. 
  New Jersey has over 71,000 cases and 3,100 deaths due to the coronavirus. 
  On Monday, police received the anonymous tip about a body being kept in a shed. 
  Instead, they found 17 bodies kept in a morgue built to house four. 
  Andover police chief Eric Danielson told the New York Times: “They were just overwhelmed by the amount of people who were expiring.”

  Italy will offer small savers a new inflation-linked bond next month to raise funds to help the economy cope with the coronavirus crisis, the country’s Treasury said. 
  Italy’s budget deficit will be near 10% of gross domestic product this year, a senior government official told Reuters, as Rome increases borrowing to counter the deep recession which the virus is expected to have caused. 
  The new “BTP Italia” bond, which pays a coupon tied to the domestic inflation rate, will have a maturity ranging from four to eight years.  
  Retail investors will be able to buy the bond from May 18 to May 20, while the offer reserved for institutional investors will take place on May 21. 
  Italy introduced the BTP Italia bonds at the height of the euro zone crisis to tap large private wealth at home in the face of scant foreign demand for its debt.

  But the number of people in hospital has declined for a second day running. 
  Jerome Salomon, head of France’s public health authority, said the total number of people in intensive care units fell for the eighth day in a row, at 6,248, a low point since April 1.

  Vladimir Putin has delayed celebrations for the 75th anniversary of Victory Day due to the coronavirus outbreak, rescheduling a patriotic holiday with major political significance. 
  In remarks on Thursday evening, Putin said that “the risk connected to the epidemic, the peak of which has not passed, are still dangerously high. And that doesn’t give me the right to begin the preparations for the parade and other mass events.”  
  The holiday is usually observed on May 9th with a military parade including soldiers, tanks and intercontinental ballistic missiles. The government has also recently adopted an event called the Immortal Regiment where hundreds of thousands of ordinary  
  Russians march bearing images of relatives who died in the war. 
  Putin did not set a new date for the parade, but promised it would take place in 2020. The Kremlin was also expected to host French President Emmanuel Macron this year in a politically significant visit that Russia hoped to portray as confirming its exit from isolation. 
  Putin announced the decision on Thursday after veterans associations submitted a similar request to him, in what was likely a politically choreographed show to justify pushing back the holiday. 
  The coronavirus epidemic has upended a busy political season in Russia, with the Kremlin already pushing back plans to hold a national plebiscite to endorse constitutional amendments that will allow Putin to run twice more for the presidency, potentially staying in office until 2036.Earlier, a video purporting to show thousands of Russian troops taking part in rehearsals for the country’s Victory Day parade has raised questions about the Kremlin’s efforts to fight the spread of coronavirus in the armed forces.

  The US has the highest number of cases with 640,291, followed by Spain, with 182,816. The number of cases of coronavirus registered globally passed 1.5 million on 9 April. 
  UK government announces lockdown extension for three weeks 
  The UK’s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Boris Johnson as he recovers from Covid-19, confirmed the extension following advice from the government’s scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage). 
  Raab said: “The government has decided that the current measures must remain in place for at least the next three weeks.” 
  He said Sage had advised that “relaxing any of the measures in place” would “undo the progress we have made” and would “risk damage to both public health and the economy”. 
  There were 861 Covid-19 deaths in UK hospitals reported on Thursday, taking the total past 13,000. 
  5 million more Americans sign on as unemployed 
  More than 22 million American have lost their jobs in the last four weeks as the coronavirus pandemic has swept across the US. 
  The US labour department announced that another 5.24 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week, making a total of 22.2 million since 14 March, when nationwide stay-at-home orders led to an unprecedented wave of layoffs across the country. 
  The largest number of people to ask for unemployment benefits in a four-week period before the Covid-19 crisis came in 1992, when 2.7 million sought support. 
  Australia PM says more Covid-19 measures needed 
  Scott Morrison, Australia’s prime minister, said the country had succeeding in flattening the infection curve but that a “more extensive surveillance regime” needed to be implemented if they were to forge “the road out” of lockdown. 
  He praised the extensive testing and contact-tracing system in place and the actions from states to open testing to anyone with symptoms. But he cautioned: “We need to do even better than that … so when we move to a less restricted environment, we can identify outbreaks very quickly and respond to them.” 
  His government has proposed a mobile app that would trace the movements of patients. At least 40% of Australians would need to download the app for it to be effective. 
  EU chief: ‘Europe owes Italy an apology’ 
  Europe owes Italy “a heartfelt apology” for not offering assistance when the country was suffering in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak, the head of the European Union executive said. 
  Speaking at the European parliament, commission president Ursula von der Leyen said truth was needed to overcome the pandemic, including political honesty. She said: “Too many were not there on time when Italy needed a helping hand at the very beginning. And yes, for that it is right that Europe as a whole offers a heartfelt apology.” 
  New York State lockdown extended 
  Governor Andrew Cuomo has extended the New York state shutdown to 15 May. He also announced that starting on Friday, anyone aged two and older would be required to wear face coverings in public if they cannot socially distance. 
  Another 606 people have died from the virus in New York, the lowest figure in 10 days, bringing the total above 12,000 in the state. 
  IMF: Asian economies will not grow this year 
  Economies in Asia will see zero growth this year for the first time in 60 years, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said. It warned that the global economy would face the “worst recession since the Great Depression” and that Asia’s service sector in particular will struggle to rebound. 
  Changyong Rhee, director of the IMF’s Asia and Pacific department, warned that governments would need to take extraordinary actions as a result. Rhee said: “This is not a time for business as usual. Asian countries need to use all policy instruments in their toolkits.” 
  Singapore reports biggest jump yet in cases 
  Singapore reported at least 728 new confirmed cases of coronavirus in the previous 24 hours, the biggest jump yet in numbers in the city-state, which had fought hard to keep its outbreak under control. 
  The latest increase in confirmed cases is 63% more than the 447 new cases reported by the health ministry on Wednesday, and brings the total number so far in the city to 4,427. 
  Singapore had been praised by the World Health Organization for rigorous contact tracing, quarantine and surveillance measures, which had previously mitigated the spread of Covid-19. But the disease has begun spreading rapidly within the large migrant worker community that Singapore relies on to staff many of its basic services, highlighting what rights groups say is a weak link in containment efforts. 
  Japan declares nationwide state of emergency 
  Japan has expanded its state of emergency to cover the entire country. 
  Shinzo Abe, the country’s prime minister, told a special meeting of medical experts called to discuss the disease: “Areas where a state of emergency should be carried out will be expanded from the seven prefectures to all prefectures.” 
  According to AFP, the declaration allows regional governors to urge people to stay indoors, but with no punitive measures or legal force the measure is weaker than strict lockdowns seen in other parts of the world. 
  Facebook to warn users who ‘like’ misinformation 
  Facebook will begin showing notifications to users who have interacted with posts that contain “harmful” coronavirus misinformation, the company announced. 
  The new policy applies only to misinformation that Facebook considers likely to contribute to “imminent physical harm”, such as false claims about “cures” or statements that physical distancing is not effective. Facebook’s policy has been to remove those posts from the platform. 
  Under the new policy, which will be rolled out in the coming weeks, users who liked, shared, commented or reacted with an emoji to such posts before they were deleted will see a message in their news feed directing them to a “myth busters” page maintained by the WHO.

  A senior public health scientist has described the plan to stage the Tour de France in August as a “recipe for disaster”, Jeremy Whittle, the Guardian’s Tour de France correspondent, reports. 
  “The wise thing to do is cancel for this year,” said Devi Sridhar, the chair of Global Public Health at the University of Edinburgh, who is also a key adviser to the Scottish government on the Covid-19 pandemic. “It’s a painful decision but they have no choice.” 
  The Tour was moved this week from its original start date in late June to a new Grand Départ in Nice on 29 August, following the banning of any large public events until 11 July by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. 
  “This is a long-term problem, a chronic problem,” Sridhar told cyclingnews.com. “This virus is here to stay and will come back. Even if France gets a handle on it by August, then of course the issue is people coming in from different countries.” 
  Sridhar pointed to a series of potential risks, that might even lead to the Tour being halted if there was an outbreak within the race convoy during the race. “There’s definitely a risk that the Tour de France moving around and unwittingly spreading the virus could kick-start a new lockdown.”

  Health authorities in Poland on Thursday announced 336 new confirmed cases of coronavirus and 28 deaths, as the first health worker in the country died from Covid-19.  
  The 46-year-old physiotherapist, a father of two, had been on intensive care in Radom, east-central Poland, after falling ill with the disease two weeks ago, local media reported. He had been working in a hospital that had become a hotspot for coronavirus, with more than 200 patients and members of staff testing positive.  
  Poland has so far reported 7918 coronavirus infections, and 314 deaths from the virus.

  The latest figures come as members of Poland’s governing coalition on Thursday sought opposition support for a two-year extension of the president’s term because of the difficulty of holding an election next month under coronavirus restrictions, Reuters reports. 
  Poland’s ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party had advocated holding a postal ballot for the May 10 election, but late on Wednesday unexpectedly presented a bill to keep President Andrzej Duda in office for longer. As a constitutional change, it needs opposition backing to secure the necessary two-thirds approval. 
  Prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki was also expected on Thursday to announce an easing of its coronavirus lockdown. 
  In March, Poland closed its borders, schools and other public places and forbade people to leave their homes except for pressing reasons. It has so far recorded 7,771 coronavirus infections and 292 deaths. 
  “Final decisions will be taken today. I think that first, starting from Monday, we can expect an opening of forests, green areas,” Deputy Prime Minister Jacek Sasin told the private radio station RMF.

  Closer international cooperation is needed to coordinate the fight against Covid-19 with greater involvement by the United Nations, international law experts have urged, writes Owen Bowcott, the Guardian’s legal correspondent. 
  The former legal director of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Professor Gian Luca Burci, and the prominent international lawyer Professor Philippe Sands QC have called for a better alert system and more information sharing. 
  While accepting that now, in the middle of a pandemic, is not the time to allocate blame, they questioned whether China should have sounded the alarm earlier and doubted whether there is a legal basis for President Trump unilaterally withdrawing US funding for the WHO. 
  In a webinar organised by the British Institute of International and Comparative Law held on Thursday afternoon, Professor Burci said:  
   
   There’s enough evidence to suggest that China knew and should have known earlier…. The WHO acted fairly quickly and quite diligently. 
   More developed countries should have known that a virus of this nature could spread internationally and it was [their] responsibility [to prepare]. 
   The lessons from this crisis is to learn planning for the next one .. There should be a more consultative mechanisms where states sit together. There needs to be cooperation. There should be a blueprint for working together. There’s a real place for the UN rather than [working] through a sectoral organisation. We need a politically effective forum for consultation. 
   The number of diseases spread internationally is expanding. So this is our future and we may not have long time to prepare. Most of the diseases [like HIV or Ebola] have had an animal origin. 
   
  In terms of Trump’s funding withdrawal, Burci said: “There’s no legal basis for a unilateral decision by the US to stop funding.” He said there is a dispute resolution in article 56 of the International Health Regulations but it has never been tested. 
  Professor Sands agreed that there is a need for improved international cooperation at a time of populist politics but any inquiry into the Covid-19 outbreak should be conducted by a panel of independent academics, he sugested, rather than the UN security council which is vulnerable to vetoes from its members such as China, the US or the UK. 
  Taiwan, not a member of WHO, he pointed out has been a model in terms of country responses: it was testing incoming passengers from Wuhan even before China declared an outbreak on December 31st last year. Coronavirus is a wake-up call for larger threats such as climate change, Sands added.

  After more than a month in which he was not seen in public, Nicaragua’s president has reappeared, giving a speech in which he claimed the coronavirus was “a sign from God”, the Associated Press reports. 
  In the televised address on Wednesday night, Daniel Ortega claimed that Nicaragua had suffered only one death from the coronavirus pandemic and that the country’s three confirmed cases were “imported”. 
  There had been concerns about the health of the 74-year-old former guerrilla leader, but he appeared well and was not using a mask during his speech. 
  Ortega has refused to adopt the social-distancing and lockdown measures used in other countries, and has in fact encouraged Nicaraguans to participate in mass gatherings. 
  Nicaraguans “haven’t stopped working, because if this country stops working, it dies”, Ortega said. The government did extend Holy Week school vacations to two weeks; classes are scheduled to resume on 20 April. 
  Ortega did not comment on how many tests have been carried out. Experts suspect there are many undetected cases.

 UK lockdown extended for three weeks 
  
  Britain’s lockdown is to continue for at least another three weeks because experts still cannot be sure the coronavirus epidemic has peaked, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has said, writes Rowena Mason, the Guardian’s deputy political editor, in London. 
  Raab, who is deputising for the prime minister while he recovers from Covid-19, said there was hope that the number of new infections was no longer rising in the community daily but there was less certainty about some hospitals and care homes. 
  However people would have to stick with the instructions to “stay at home, protect the NHS, and save lives” until scientists and medics could be sure the outbreak was under control. 
  “The worst thing we could do is ease up too soon. It would be the worst outcome not just for public health but the economy and the country as a whole,” he said.

  The coronavirus outbreak in Canada’s long term care homes has become so grave that one province has repeatedly asked for the military to be deployed, prime minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday, Leyland Cecco reports from Toronto.  
  Calling it an “unusual request”, Trudeau said the officials in Quebec have sent three requests to the federal government for help. 
  “We know this is a serious situation if Quebec is asking the federal government for help. We will do this as quickly as possible so we can send them the support they need,” said Trudeau. But he also said that while the military had a number of doctors, he wasn’t sure if troops were well-suited to aid in care homes.  
  The hardest-hit province in the country, Quebec is grappling with a mounting death toll among its elderly population and a shortage of workers for retirement homes. On Wednesday, premier François Legault said an additional healthcare workers were needed, calling the situation a “national emergency”.

  There are more than 14,000 cases recorded in the province with at least 487 deaths. Across the country, nearly half of the 1,048 deaths from Covid-19 have been in long term care home.  
  Ontario, the country’s most populous province, is also grappling with outbreaks in its care homes. On Wednesday, premier Doug Ford announced new directives to prevent care aides and nursing staff from working at multiple locations.  
  The prime minister admitted the impact to seniors residences has been “more severe” than the government had hoped. “The conditions are getting more and more difficult.”

  Italy registered 525 more deaths from Covid-19 on Thursday, 53 less than Wednesday, taking the death toll to 22,170, Lorenzo Tondo in Palermo reports. 
  The number of people who are currently infected rose by 1189 in a day, 62 more than on Wednesday. Some 2,072 have recovered in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number to 40,164. 
  The Civil Protection agency said the overall total of cases in Italy, including the deceased, the currently infected and those who have recovered, is now 168,941, up 3,786 on Thursday. 
  Authorities said the number of intensive care beds in use continues to fall: 2,936 are currently hospitalised in intensive care units - the lowest number registered since 21 March.  
  Italy’s government is still working on a plan to enter ‘phase two’ of its lockdown, which is set to end on 3 May, as several regions, worried for the economic impact, are urging Rome to not extend the quarantine beyond its current deadline.

  More good news for Greece on the Covid-19 front, as research showed that when it comes to containing the deadly disease it is the best performing country in Europe, writes Helena Smith in Athens.  
  In what has been described as ground-breaking analysis of the best and worst performing countries on the continent, Greece has outstripped all others in both dealing with the outbreak, according to The Bridge Tank. The independent economic think tank says: 
   
   Thanks to early and strict containment measures, they have successfully managed to flatten the curve and slow down the spread of the virus. The contrast between Greece – which suspended public events and closed schools even before the first 100 cases were detected, and Spain – which took similar decisions at a much later stage of the epidemic – is particularly striking. 
   
  Greek health authorities have confirmed 2,207 cases of coronavirus and 105 deaths to date. In the pan-European comparative analysis it was followed by the Czech Republic and Romania. The report went on: 
   
   Four weeks after the first 100 COVID-19 cases were detected in each country, it took 19 days for the number of cases in Greece to double, a clear indicator that Greece has successfully ‘flattened the curve’. At the other end of the spectrum, the UK is still witnessing a sharp rise in confirmed cases.

  Slovakia has posted its biggest daily jump in the number of new coronavirus cases, bringing its total to nearly 1,000, the country’s health ministry said on Thursday, according to Reuters.  
  On Wednesday, Slovakia recorded 114 new cases, bringing the total to 977 since the virus was first detected in March. The jump surpassed a daily rise of 101 cases recorded on 7 April, when at least 31 cases were detected in marginalised Roma communities, prompting the state to quarantine five settlements in eastern Slovakia. Eight coronavirus patients have died so far. 
   While neighbours in central Europe such as the Czech Republic and Poland begin to ease restrictions as the growth in cases slows or steadies, Slovak prime minister Igor Matovic has said the country will re-open only cautiously.  
  Slovakia has has banned international passenger travel, closed schools and most shops, banned cultural, religious and sporting events and imposed 14-day quarantine for anyone returning from abroad.

 EU chief: 'Europe owes Italy an apology' 
  
  Europe owes Italy “a heartfelt apology” for not being there when the country was suffering the consequences of coronavirus, the head of the European Union executive has said. 
  Speaking at the European parliament, European commission president Ursula von der Leyen said truth was needed to overcome the pandemic, including political honesty. 
   
   Too many were not there on time when Italy needed a helping hand at the very beginning. And yes for that it is right that Europe as a whole offers a heartfelt apology. 
   
  She went on to claim that Europe is now “the world’s beating heart of solidarity,” citing German deliveries of ventilators to Spain, the Czech Republic’s decision to open hospitals to French coronavirus patients, as well as the Polish paramedics and Romanian doctors saving lives in Italy.

  The direct apology to Italy went further than von der Leyen’s previous expressions of regret, where she chided member states for an “only-for-me response” during the early phase of the pandemic. At the start of the crisis, France and Germany imposed export bans on vital medical equipment, while no European country initially answered Italy’s call for aid via the EU’s emergency mechanism. 
  A mid March opinion poll found that 88% of Italians felt Europe was failing to support Italy, results that rattled Brussels and other national capitals. 
  EU leaders are meeting next Thursday, where they will again try to chart a common path out of the crisis, but they remain divided on the best economic recovery plan.

  MPs in Sweden have passed a new law granting the government temporary powers to quickly adopt measures aimed at curbing the spread of coronavirus, AFP reports.  
  The new law grants the Social Democrat-led government the ability to temporarily close businesses, limit public gatherings or shut down ports and airports, as well as a number of other measures.  
  It comes after criticism of the comparatively relaxed approach taken so far in the Scandinavian country, which had held back from strict measures and now has a rate of coronavirus deaths and infections that is far higher than its near neighbours.

  The government is still prohibited from adopting measures that curtail rights guaranteed by the country’s constitution, meaning it would still need to go through parliament to issue the type of curfews that have been imposed elsewhere in Europe. 
  So far the government has banned gatherings of more than 50 people and barred visits to nursing homes. On Thursday, the government also decided on a month-long extension of a ban on non-necessary travel to the country from outside the EU, in line with a joint EU decision. 
  The new powers come into force on 18 April and last until the end of June. 
  Sweden’s public health agency on Thursday reported another 130 deaths from coronavirus, bringing the total death toll in the country to 1,333. So far the country has recorded 12,540 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Of those, 996 have been treated in intensive care.

 Singapore reports biggest jump yet in cases 
  
  Singapore has reported 728 new confirmed cases of coronavirus detected in the past 24 hours, the biggest jump yet in numbers in the city state, which had fought hard to keep its outbreak under control.  
  The latest increase in confirmed cases is 63% more than the 447 new cases reported by the health ministry on Wednesday, and brings the total number so far in the city to 4,427.  
  Singapore had been praised by the World Health Organization for rigorous contact tracing, quarantine and surveillance measures, which had previously mitigated the spread of Covid-19.  
   But the disease has begun spreading rapidly within the large migrant worker community that Singapore relies upon to staff many of its basic services, highlighting what rights groups say is a weak link in containment efforts, Reuters reports.

 5m more Americans sign on as unemployed 
  
  More than 22 million American have lost their jobs in the last four weeks as the coronavirus pandemic has swept across the US, according to government figures, write Dominic Rushe and Amanda Holpuch in New York. 
  The US labor department announced on Thursday that another 5.24 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week, making a total of 22.2 million since 14 March when nationwide stay at home orders led to an unprecedented wave of layoffs across the country. 
  The largest number of people to ask for unemployment benefits in a four-week period before the Covid-19 crisis came in 1992 when 2.7 million sought support. 
   
   This graph shows the rise in initial unemployment claims recorded since the coronavirus crisis began affecting the US in mid-March 
   
  The torrent of layoffs has swept across the country, and every sector of the economy, leading to backlogs and anger at state unemployment offices as people have struggled to make claims. The delays are likely to trigger further spikes in the figures in coming weeks. 
  “It’s akin to the entire country being hit by a hurricane,” said Jason Reed, assistant chair of finance at the University of Notre Dame. “And we don’t know when the hurricane is leaving.”

  The death rate in “institutional households” in the Netherlands has doubled since the first part of this year, the Dutch public health authority has said, as it reported 181 more deaths from Covid-19 on Thursday. The death toll in the Netherlands is now 3,315. 
  At 2pm on Thursday, RIVM said 1,061 more people had tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the Netherlands up to 29,214. The number of patients admitted to hospital with the disease is 9,309, up 182 on a day earlier.  
  Institutional households include care homes, mental health institutions, residential institutions for the disabled, prisons, and residential centres for asylum seekers, RIVM said in a news release. In an updated filed this afternoon, the agency said it estimates that a third of Dutch care homes now have at least one patient with coronavirus.  
  The death rate in private households was 1.5 times higher than usual.

 Belgium begins testing in all care homes

   Belgium is one of only a few countries in Europe that includes all non-hospitalised people who displayed symptoms of the disease in its daily tally of Covid-19 deaths, even if they had not been confirmed as having had it.

 UK reports 861 new Covid-19 deaths 
  
  The UK’s health department has issued the latest daily figures for coronavirus hospital deaths. There were 861, taking the running total to 13,729. 
  Yesterday the daily figure was 761 but Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government’s chief medical adviser, said in the press conference yesterday afternoon that he expected today’s figure to be higher.

 Facebook to warn users who 'like' misinformation 
  
  Facebook will begin showing notifications to users who have interacted with posts that contain “harmful” coronavirus misinformation, the company announced on Thursday, writes Julia Carrie Wong, the Guardian’s tech reporter in San Francisco. 
  The new policy applies only to misinformation that Facebook considers likely to contribute to “imminent physical harm”, such as false claims about “cures” or statements that physical distancing is not effective. Facebook’s policy has been to remove those posts from the platform. 
  Under the new policy, which will be rolled out in the coming weeks, users who liked, shared, commented or reacted with an emoji to such posts before they were deleted will see a message in their news feed directing them to a “myth busters” page maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO). 
  Announcing the move, Guy Rosen, Facebook’s vice-president of integrity, said in a blogpost:  
   
   We’re going to start showing messages in News Feed to people who have liked, reacted or commented on harmful misinformation about COVID-19 that we have since removed. These messages will connect people to COVID-19 myths debunked by the WHO including ones we’ve removed from our platform for leading to imminent physical harm.  
   We want to connect people who may have interacted with harmful misinformation about the virus with the truth from authoritative sources in case they see or hear these claims again off of Facebook. People will start seeing these messages in the coming weeks.  
   Facebook does not take down other misinformation about Covid-19, such as conspiracy theories about the virus’s origins, but instead relies on its third-party factchecking system. If a factchecker rates a claim false, Facebook then adds a notice to the post, reduces its spread, alerts anyone who shared it, and discourages users from sharing it further.

  Germans have the right to hold public protests if they adhere to social distancing rules, the country’s constitutional court has ruled.  
  A group of pro-democracy activists had petitioned the court after authorities in the town of Giessen banned a protest planned this week to denounce lockdown rules that prevent public gatherings of more than two people.  
  They said the measures breached freedom of assembly, a key tenet of the German constitution.  
  Although two lower courts had previously sided with the local authorities, the constitutional court said a general ban on demonstrations would be unconstitutional.  
  However, it stopped short of allowing the protest planned this week to go ahead.

  Amazon has closed its six distribution centres in France, two days after a French court ruled it was not doing enough to protect workers from the coronavirus pandemic. 
  The company is facing mounting scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic as it tries to deal with a surge in online orders during lockdowns while keeping employees safe. 
  On Tuesday a court in Nanterre, Paris, issued an emergency ruling requiring the company to stop selling non-essential goods for a month while it works out new safety measures. 
  Sales of food, medicine and hygiene supplies are still allowed under the ruling. However, Amazon France said that given the “inherent complexity” of its activities, and the potential €1m (£870,000) fine for each violation of the ruling, the risk was too high. 
  Amazon France’s chief executive, Frédéric Duval, denounced the court’s order on Thursday, saying the company had spent “colossal amounts” on health precautions including sanitary gels and face masks. He said the firm would appeal.

  The author Luis Sepúlveda, the celebrated author and former communist militant from Chile during the Pinochet regime, has died at a hospital in northern Spain, AFP reports.  
  Best-known for his 1992 novel, “The Old Man Who Read Love Stories”, Sepulveda, who was 70, was particularly successful in Europe, where he had been based since the 1980s. 
  His works, appreciated for their simple humour and depictions of life in South America, have been translated in some 50 countries and range from novels, chronicles and novellas to children’s stories. 
  “I write because I believe in the militant force of words”, he once wrote.

  Sepulveda was born on 4 October, 1949, at Ovalle, north of the Chilean capital Santiago. From a young age he was a political activist, first for Chile’s Communist Youth, and then for the Socialists. 
  He was arrested and jailed for treason for two and a half years in 1973 under the military regime of Augusto Pinochet. After rights group Amnesty International intervened, Sepulveda was freed and escaped, living underground for nearly a year before being recaptured and sent into exile in 1977. 
  He never returned to live in Chile and it was only in 2017 that he regained his Chilean nationality, which had been stripped from him decades earlier. 
  He first began showing symptoms of Covid-19 on February 25 after returning from a festival in Portugal.

  Health authorities in Russia reported 3,448 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus on Thursday, up from 3,388 a day earlier, bringing the overall number of cases in the country 27,938, Reuters reports. 
  Thirty-four people died in the last 24 hours, which took the national coronavirus death toll to 232, the Russian coronavirus crisis response centre said.  
  The latest figures came as the Kremlin said it would accept a “kind offer” by Donald Trump to ship ventilators from the US if Russia felt it needed them. 
  Russia shipped ventilators and protective gear this month to the US after a phone call between Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. 
  Trump told Putin in a recent phone call that the US could reciprocate as it begins to produce more ventilators, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call on Thursday. 
  “If necessary, Russia would of course take advantage of this kind offer,” Peskov said.

  Spain is to introduce a targeted basic income to support its least well off citizens through the economic slump to come after its coronavirus outbreak, according to the leader of junior coalition partner Podemos.  
  In a statement posted on Twitter on Thursday morning, Pablo Iglesias, secretary general of the centre-left party, said the basic income was “a measure of social justice and also of economic efficiency”. He wrote: 
   
   We are very happy that in the coalition government we have finally agreed that in this country there will be a minimum vital income this May.  
   There are hundreds of thousands of families in Spain that could not wait several months; The government is aware of its situation and will work to accelerate to the maximum all the necessary procedures so that this minimum vital income is effectively functioning in this month of May. 
   It is a measure of social justice and also of economic efficiency: it will allow the fridge of many compatriots to be filled and it will also allow many people to maintain a minimum consumption capacity, which is essential for the economy to recover as quickly as possible when we have defeated the virus. 
   ... Everything is ready so that the teams of the vice-presidency for social rights and the ministry of inclusion, social security and migration hold new meetings, as we have had for days now to finish defining the details of this social protection system, which is called to become a new nuclear social right of our welfare state and of our democracy. 
   This is not a victory for the coalition government, nor for Podemos; it is a victory for all the groups that for many years have worked through thick and thin to put on the table the need for a minimum income. 
   To all of them: thank you. We hope to be in the expectations. 
   
  Here’s the first tweet in the thread for you to read for yourself.

  In a bid to keep up with the coronavirus spread, the Indian state of Kerala is set to convert thousands of its iconic houseboats into isolation wards, writes Hannah Ellis-Petersen, the Guardian’s South Asia correspondent. 
  Around 2,000 houseboats, which usually travel through the serene, palm tree-lined backwaters of Kerala, are currently being converted into isolation facilities for coronavirus patients. 
  The two storey luxury boats are beloved by tourists and are also a popular purchase among Bollywood actors, who are known to renovate them to the highest standards of luxury. 
  “We are happy to hand over our boats,” said Kevin Rozario, general secretary of All Kerala Houseboat Owners and Operators Association. “By handing over our boats, we are joining the global fight against the virus. We see it as our duty and we will provide all help.”

  According to the local government, the boats can be made fit for purpose by the end of the month, and then can be moved to remote locations for the safety of patients and locals. 
  It follows on from the Indian government beginning to renovate 20,000 train carriages into medical facilities and isolation wards two weeks ago. Each train carriage holds 16 beds and a total of 320,000 patients could be cared for in the “quarantine coaches”, a statement from the railways said. 
  India currently has 12,380 confirmed coronavirus cases and 414 deaths. However, officials believe the real figure could be much higher as India has one of the lowest testing rates in the world.

 Japan declares nationwide state of emergency 
  
  Japan has expanded its state of emergency to cover the entire country, AFP reports. 
  My colleague in Tokyo, Justin McCurry, earlier reported that Shinzō Abe, the country’s prime minister, was poised to announce the expansion of measures, which had already been declared in seven regions, including Tokyo.  
  On Thursday evening, Abe told a special meeting of medical experts called to discuss the disease:  
   
   Areas where a state of emergency should be carried out will be expanded from the seven prefectures to all prefectures 
   
  According to AFP, the declaration allows regional governors to urge people to stay indoors, but with no punitive measures or legal force the measure is far weaker than strict lockdowns seen in other parts of the world. 
  Despite recording its first case in mid-January, Japan has so far seen a relatively small outbreak with about 8,500 infections and 136 deaths by Thursday.

  Security forces enforcing the lockdown in Nigeria to curb the spread of Covid-19 have killed more people so far than the virus itself, the country’s official human rights body reports.  
  Nigeria has imposed a total lockdown in the capital Abuja and economic hub Lagos, a city of some 21 million people, and set restrictions in other regions in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus, with security forces, including the police and army, deployed to enforce them.  
  In a report released late on Wednesday, the National Human Rights Commission said it had received and documented “105 complaints of incidents of human rights violations perpetuated by security forces” in 24 of Nigeria’s 36 states and Abuja. 
  Of these complaints, “there were 8 documented incidents of extrajudicial killings leading to 18 deaths”, it said. According to the latest figures published on Wednesday night, 12 people in Nigeria have died of Covid-19, out of a total of 407 confirmed cases. The report added:  
   
   This speaks volumes of the protocols and rules of engagement for our law enforcement as well the efficiency level and capacity of law enforcement agents to deal with civil population. It’s a sheer display of impunity and reckless disregard for human life in law enforcement by security personnel.

  Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the head of the World Health Organization in Africa, has called Donald Trump’s decision to cut funding for the UN health body a blow to efforts to support healthcare across Africa.  
  Asked in a press briefing about the impact of the decision by the WHO’s biggest funder to withhold cash, Moeti said it would have an impact that went beyond the WHO’s ability to fund efforts to fight Covid-19. She warned efforts to fight polio, HIV and malaria in Africa were also likely to be affected.  
   
   Overall, we will be needing about $300m for the next six months at least to support what countries are doing [to combat Covid-19). This has been a blow to the global WHO budget.

  The French military has ordered an inquiry into how the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, the flagship of the naval fleet, was contaminated with Covid-19 after a third of its crew tested positive for the virus, Kim Willsher, the Guardian’s Paris correspondent, reports. 
  The cluster is especially puzzling as the nuclear-powered vessel had reportedly had no contact with the outside world since it went to sea on 15 March.  
  Last Friday, the French defence ministry confirmed 50 sailors had coronavirus and the ship, in the Atlantic at the time, was ordered back to base in the port of Toulon on France’s Mediterranean coast. It arrived on Sunday, two weeks earlier than planned. 
  Since then 668 sailors, one third of the 1,767-strong crew have tested positive, the French defence ministry confirmed.

  “Today, 31 of them are in hospital, one in intensive care. We do not have the results for 30% of the tests,” it said in a statement. 
  The crew has been placed in isolation for 14 days before being allowed to rejoin their families.  
  “Operations to disinfect the vessel and aircraft have begun,” the French defence minister, Florence Parly, said adding a message of support for the confined sailors and their families. 
  The Charles de Gaulle was docked at Brest on France’s western coast between 13-15 March, where the sailors were given shore leave. This was two days before the strict confinement. 
  Admiral Christophe Prazuck, the chief of staff of the French navy, has ordered an inquiry into the contamination of the vessel.  
  The Charles de Gaulle, which carries Rafale fighter planes, Hawkeye surveillance and control aircraft as well as Caracal and Cougar helicopters and Aster anti-air missiles, had been on exercise since 21 January.  
  It spent several weeks in the Mediterranean as part of Opération Chammal, the French contribution to the international anti-terrorist operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq and Syria. It then sailed to the North Sea and then the Atlantic for “operations of security and defence” to European sea routes, said the ministry.

  Spain recorded 5,183 new cases of the virus between Wednesday and Thursday, bringing its total number of confirmed cases to 182,816 - a rise of 2.9% on the previous 24 hours, writes Sam Jones in Madrid.  
  Over recent days, the increase in new cases has been holding at around 3% a day, well down from a daily average of 12% at the end of March and 20% in mid-March. To date, Spain has recorded 19,130 deaths. 
  Questions remain over Spain’s official figures because of the way it tests and reports. So far, the official figures from the health ministry have been based only on deaths of people who have tested positive for the coronavirus.

  As the health minister, Salvado Illa, put it recently: “Anyone who’s been positively diagnosed with the coronavirus and who dies is a person who’s counted as a victim of the coronavirus.” 
  A lot of people are likely to have died from the virus without having been tested, meaning their deaths do not figure in the official count.  
  This is particularly the case in care homes, where thousands of people have died untested, but showed symptoms consistent with the coronavirus.  
  According to figures analysed by El País, at least 11,600 people have died of the virus - or displaying symptoms associated with it - in Spanish care homes. Those deaths would account for almost two-thirds of the nationwide fatalities. 
  On Wednesday, Catalonia’s regional government changed the way it counted coronavirus deaths after asking for data from funeral companies. 
  It now puts the region’s death toll - in hospitals, homes and care homes - at 7,097. However, the rise in the death toll has not been factored into Thursday’s figure from the Spanish health ministry, which puts the regional death toll at 3,855.

  Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is poised to declare a nationwide state of emergency in an attempt to contain the coronavirus outbreak, Japanese media reports said on Thursday, writes Justin McCurry in Tokyo. 
  Abe last week declared a month-long state of emergency in seven regions, including Tokyo, but has come under pressure to include other parts of the country amid a steady rise in Covid-19 cases. 
  The move stops far short of the lockdowns introduced in other countries. Instead, local authorities have asked people to stay indoors and request that non-essential businesses close, but there are no penalties for those who fail to comply. 
  The government has said people have to reduce contact with others by 70-80% to avoid an explosive growth in infections in Japan, which has so far seen a relatively small outbreak, despite recording its first case in mid-January, with about 8,500 infections and 136 deaths by Thursday. 
  As a result, there has been a significant fall in the number of commuters on Tokyo’s usually crowded public transport system and some central parts of the city are practically deserted. But experts fear the virus could spread in local neighbourhoods, where the streets appear to be much busier.

  Since the state of emergency emergency came into effect on 8 April, several regional governors have called for the measures to be expanded to cover their areas – warning of a growing number of infections and stretched medical facilities. 
  The chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said the government would consult experts on Thursday before widening the state of emergency from seven to all 47 of Japan’s prefectures.  
  In a joint statement issued this week, emergency medical associations warned that they were “already sensing the collapse of the emergency medical system”, with hospitals unable to deal with patients suffering from illnesses other than Covid-19. 
  In addition, the mayor of Osaka, Japan’s third-biggest city, this week appealed for donations of raincoats to be repurposed as protective clothing for health workers who were being forced to use bin liners due to a shortage of equipment.

 1m coronavirus tests to be rolled out across Africa 
  
  More than 1 million coronavirus tests will be rolled out in Africa from next week to address a gap in assessing the number of cases on the continent, the head of the African Union’s health body has said.  
  In an online briefing to journalists on Thursday, John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control, said maybe 15 million tests would be required across Africa in the next three months, the Associated Press reported.  
  Africa has suffered in the global race to obtain testing kits and other badly needed medical equipment. While the number of virus cases across the continent was above 17,000 on Thursday, health officials have said the testing shortage means more are out there. South Africa, the most assertive African nation in testing, has carried out perhaps 80,000 tests so far, Nkengasong said.

   He also expressed concern for the US decision to cut funding for the World Health Organization, saying it absolutely will affect African Union member states’ ability to receive support from the UN agency.  
  Any reduction in support for African nations will be painful as the continent has some of the world’s weakest health systems. 
   Ten African nations have no ventilators at all to treat virus patients who need respiratory support, the Africa CDC chief said, but arrangements are being made to deliver some recently donated by the Jack Ma Foundation. Nkengasong did not name the 10 countries.

  In a development that runs contrary to the rules of science and technology, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps claims to have invented a device that can detect the presence of coronavirus at a distance of 100 metres, writes Patrick Wintour, the Guardian’s diplomatic editor. 
  The IRGC, subject to intense US sanctions and seen by Washington as the source of instability across the Middle East, unveiled the device earlier this week at a ceremony hosted by its commander Maj Gen Hossein Salami.

  The device “creates a magnetic field, and by using an embedded bipolar virus, any infected area can be detected within a 100-metre radius”, according to the IRGC, which said the process takes under five seconds. 
  Salami said:  
   
   This device does not require blood transfusions and operates remotely and intelligently, i.e. it is used for mass screening and fully detects infected surfaces and people who are infected. 
   
  He said it would also act as a smart disinfectant since it would know which areas need disinfecting.  
   
   This is an amazing scientific phenomenon, and it has been tested in various hospitals, and it has answered more than 80% of its accuracy, and it will be a very good basis for any kind of virus.  
   
  It is fair to say that the device’s unveiling led to a degree of scepticism on social media, with some Iranians saying they did not know whether to laugh or cry. 
  Separately Babak Shokri, vice-chancellor of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences claimed Iran will be able to market a coronavirus-resistant fabric within a month.

  The number of confirmed cases in west Africa is steadily rising since the first case confirmed by Nigeria on 27 February. All countries in the region are affected and under lockdowns of varying degrees, with international travel suspended and movement increasingly prohibited. Ivory Coast has the highest number of confirmed cases at 654.  
  Yet, across west Africa testing is very limited, with Ghana testing about 35,000 people so far and Nigeria only about 5,000. In Lagos, authorities have just begun the first community testing to determine the spread in the wider population, as so far tests have only been conducted on people who have recently travelled into the country or who have alerted authorities to their condition.  
  Nigeria’s government is racing to strengthen a chronically underfunded health system, with only a few hundred ICUs and ventilators for its 200 million people, according to medical unions. Nigeria spends 4% of GDP on health, which is among the lowest levels in percentage terms in Africa. Nigeria already has an oxygen crisis, with 625,000 people dying each year due to hospitals not having enough oxygen provision. In recent weeks, strikes by doctors have further highlighted the difficulties in health services, amid complaints of unpaid salaries and poor working conditions.The number of laboratories testing for Covid-19 are being quickly expanded and health centres built with help from the private sector. But there remain fears that even a moderate outbreak could overwhelm the system unless much more is done.  
  The financial toll of the lockdowns on the poor in west Africa is already becoming clear, with videos across social media of citizens pleading for food supplies and money. Lockdowns have been widespread but help is incredibly limited. Ghana has been among the more proactive countries, yet most are struggling to provide adequate supplies to more than a fraction of the people affected. In Senegal, there are fears that more than 100,000 street children, known locally as Talibés, who beg on the streets are at a greater risk of contracting the coronavirus. Many are homeless or living in squalid, congested Islamic boarding schools. Senegalese authorities say they are trying to help by providing education centres for 1,500 children.

 Europe still in the midst of the Covid-19 storm, World Health Organization warns 
  
  More from the World Health Organization press briefing, as the body’s European regional director warns that the continent is still in the midst of the storm of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the number of cases nearing a million. 
  “As of today, Europe remains very much at the centre of the pandemic. And on the one hand, we have reason to be optimistic, and at the other to be still concerned,” the WHO’s Hans Kluge said. 
  In the past 10 days, the number of cases reported in Europe has nearly doubled to close to 1 million, he told reporters in an online briefing. This meant about 50% of the global burden of Covid-19 was in Europe, Kluge said.

  The French government has unveiled a vast package of measures estimated at €110bn (£95.8bn) to help the country through the coronavirus crisis. 
  A new budget bill announced by the prime minister, Édouard Philippe, aims to address the economic and social problems caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. 
  It is a significant increase on the €45bn plan announced in March but the finance minister, Gérard Darmanin, said noone could be sure €110n would be enough. “The government is prepared to go further if necessary,” Darmanin said. 
  France is among Europe’s worst-hit countries from the pandemic, with more than 134,000 confirmed cases and in excess of 17,000 deaths, according to figures compiled by John Hopkins University. 
  With the loss of an estimated €43bn in tax revenues and increased costs to mitigate the crisis, the economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, has announced he expects the French economy to shrink by 8% this year. Measures in the emergency package include:  
   
   Frontline hospital staff are to get bonuses of between €500 and €1,500 and up to time and a half for overtime hours until the end of the health emergency. The extra payments and bonuses will be free of tax and social charges. There will also be payments to carers in nursing and residential homes. 
   Public officials who are working through the lockdown could be eligible for bonuses of up to €1,000, including police officers and teachers who have taken care of the children of essential workers. 
   From mid-May, there will be additional financial support paid to low-income families: a €150 one-off payment and an extra €100 per child. Other low-income families will receive €100 per child. 
   The budget for the “partial unemployment” scheme under which firms are encouraged to keep workers on staff during the lockdown, with the government paying a large part of their salaries, was given an extra €4bn, taking it to €24bn. About eight million French workers from an estimated 700,000 companies are believed to be on the scheme. Workers at qualifying companies who earn up to €4,607.82 net – which is four and a half times the minimum wage – are paid 84% of their net salary while not working; those on the minimum wage will receive their full salary. The scheme covers temporary staff but not interns or apprentices.  
   A further 900,000 small French businesses, freelancers and self-employed have applied for financial help that has also been increased from €1,500 to €3,500. Small businesses and the self-employed have been allowed to suspend payments of rent, gas and electricity. 
   
  The government appears to be making good on the president, Emmanuel Macron’s, early pledge that no French firms would be allowed to go under during the coronavirus crisis. 
  Le Maire said the government was also considering what financial aid should be given to the struggling national airline AirFrance-KLM and said he would announce its decision “in the coming days”.

  The coronavirus pandemic should act as a call for solidarity among Europe’s leaders, the German finance minister, Olaf Scholz, has said, adding that he hoped the European Union would emerge from it stronger. Reuters reports: 
   
   EU finance ministers agreed last week on half-a-trillion euros of support for their coronavirus-battered economies, but left open the question of how to finance the subsequent recovery in the bloc, which is headed for a steep recession. “The current challenge is a call for solidarity. That applies on a global scale, but it also applies particularly for Europe,” Scholz said. 
   
   
   His comments came in an interview with Reuters on Thursday, in which he also reiterated Germany’s reluctance to commit any form of collective post-lockdown debt issuance by the bloc or its institutions. Asked how the pandemic would change the EU, Scholz said: “I hope it will be stronger, more united and more confident.” 
   
   
   The outbreak has laid bare bitter divisions within the bloc, with member states squabbling over topics including money, medical equipment and drugs, border restrictions and trade curbs. 
   
   
   Last week’s agreement did not resolve the issue of whether to use joint debt to help finance the recovery, something Italy, France and Spain pushed strongly for but which remains a red line for Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Austria. 
   
   
   The bloc’s 27 national leaders are only committed to discussing whether “innovative financial instruments” should be applied, paving the way for further debate.

  MEPs and civil society groups have called on the European commission and European Council to condemn the Hungarian government’s exploitation of the coronavirus crisis to erode democracy. 
  In an open letter, 80 signatories, including Human Rights Watch and Transparency International, warned the European commission president, Ursula Gertrud von der Leyen, and the European Council president, Charles Michel, that they must not allow Hungary’s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orbán to use the pandemic as a smokescreen for anti-democratic activities 
  The measures, in place since late March, have been criticised for the sweeping powers they hand to Orbán, to rule by decree. Another part of the bill provides penalties of up to five years in prison for those spreading misinformation during the pandemic. 
  The letter says: “We cannot allow unscrupulous political actors to use the current climate as a pretext for dismantling democracy and undermining the rule of law.  
   
   The recent actions of Viktor Orbán’s government in Hungary are a flagrant attack on the cornerstones of the rule of law and the values of the union. We therefore urge you to unequivocally condemn the Hungarian government’s misuse of the coronavirus crisis to erode democratic values.  
   
   
   The European Commission and the Council must also take swift and decisive actions to address these threats to the rule of law being carried out under the guise of emergency powers.”

  Death rates from coronavirus in Ireland and Northern Ireland appear to be stabilising but care homes continue to be badly hit. 
  At least 10 people died in a care home in Derry over the past two weeks and eight died in a psychiatric centre in county Laois last weekend. 
  Irish authorities also reported the death of two healthcare workers, a man in his 40s and a woman in her 50s, who worked St Luke’s hospital in Kilkenny. 
  Ireland on Wednesday recorded 38 deaths, including that of a 23-year-old, bringing the official toll to 444. There are 12,547 confirmed cases of infection. 
  Ireland’s death rate has stabilised in recent days and the number of people in intensive care has declined slightly, prompting cautious optimism. “While a number of these parameters are going in a positive direction, it is clear that we need to keep going in our efforts, on an individual level, to limit the spread of this virus,” Tony Holohan, the chief medical officer, told a media briefing. 
  Northern Ireland reported six deaths on Wednesday, bringing its total to 121 deaths in hospitals, with 2,088 cases of infection. The predicted number of deaths was less severe than originally feared, when modelling suggested 3,000 deaths, said Robin Swann, the health minister. “We cannot be certain of how this first wave will play out – no modelling can predict the future – but we can acknowledge that the unprecedented social distancing restrictions on all our lives are starting to make an impact.”

  More from the Netherlands, where a study of blood donors has discovered that around 3% have developed antibodies against the new coronavirus, giving an indication of what percentage of the Dutch population may have already had the disease. 
  The head of the National Institute for Health (RIVM), Jaap van Dissel, disclosed the results during a debate with parliament on Thursday. 
  “This study shows that about 3% of Dutch people have developed antibodies against the coronavirus,” Van Dissel said. “You can calculate from that, it’s several hundred thousand people” in a country of 17 million. 
  There are 28,158 confirmed coronavirus cases in the Netherlands, but only the very ill and healthcare workers are currently being tested, Reuters reports.

  The president of Afghanistan has asked the Taliban to declare a ceasefire in an effort to instead fight coronavirus as the number of confirmed cases reached 840, triggered by a surge of infections in Kabul. 
  The country’s president, Ashraf Ghani, has asked for a ceasefire across the country so health workers can fight the virus. “I call on the Taliban to give a positive response to the rightful demand of United Nations secretary general, regional governments, people of Afghanistan and the government to stop war and declare a ceasefire,” he said. 
  About 56 new Covid-19 cases have been recorded in the last 24 hours, a health ministry spokesman said in a press conference in Kabul. Of the new cases, 37 were confirmed in Kabul, the country’s capital. The city of six million, which has so far recorded 238 confirmed cases, is under full lockdown in an attempt to contain the spread of the disease. 
  Six new coronavirus deaths have also been reported in the same period, pushing the death toll to 30. There have been 56 recoveries so far.Of new cases, 11 have been confirmed in Herat, Afghanistan’s worst affected area so far, with 321 confirmed cases.In Kandahar, the testing process is halted due to lack of test kits, local officials said. The province has had a surge in infections as thousands of Afghan migrants poured back from Pakistan in recent days. Kandahar went into full lockdown on Wednesday.A health ministry spokesman said the real number of infections is higher than what the ministry announces as many of patients decline to be hospitalised, citing “social stigma”.“We’re so vulnerable, because of war, migrants and also we are a poor nation but our good point is that we get united at times of crises,” the spokesman said.

  The Foreign Office has responded to our earlier report detailing how Britons have been left stranded in Peru after missing UK repatriation flight because a military aircraft that had been sent to collect them refused to let them board. 
  According to the Foreign Office, a dozen passengers were unable to board the flight from Cusco to the country’s capital, Lima, because they failed a health screening.  
  A Foreign Office spokesman said: “We can confirm that, unfortunately, a dozen passengers were refused access to the military flight from Cusco to Lima that was due to join up with the flight to London. The Peruvian authorities denied them boarding, following health screening.  
  “We recognise this is deeply disappointing for these passengers and a worrying time. We will continue to do all we can to support them and other British nationals who remain in Peru.”

  Authorities in the India state of Kashmir have issued an unusual order as part of their efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus: the felling of thousands of poplar trees. 
  The Jammu and Kashmir administration said pollen from the millions of Russian poplar trees in the region risked causing hay fever and allergies, which could result in sneezing and coughing, which might then increase the spread of coronavirus and make people more vulnerable. 
  The order issued by the Jammu and Kashmir government requested district administrations to carry out “lopping/felling” of the poplar trees as they “may prove fatal to the public health”. 
  “The pollen of said trees,” added one local magistrate, “create influenza like infections which may create unnecessary panic among the general public”. The magistrate ordered all poplar trees in the district to be cut within the week. 
  The ruling was the result of a petition filed to the Jammu and Kashmir high court in early April, stating that poplar pollen could create “havoc for humans with respiratory diseases” and potentially aggravate COVID-19 infections. 
  However, doctors have called this into question, stating there is little evidence that poplar pollen causes respiratory problems. Activists and conservationists, meanwhile, said the felling will have a hugely detrimental impact on the environment of Kashmir. 
  “Eradication of exotic varieties of poplars would result in an economic and ecological disaster in Kashmir,” warned Tariq Hussain Masoodi, dean of the forest faculty at Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agriculture Sciences and Technology. 
  The Jammu and Kashmir government said they had now assembled a team of experts and would be evaluating the issue over the next two weeks. 
  There are an estimated 10-15m poplar trees in Kashmir, and every April they shed cotton-like balls, which can be seen floating in the air. But this is not the first time they have been subject to a felling order. In 2015, following health concerns, Jammu and Kashmir high court banned the sale, purchase and planting of the trees and ordered millions felled.

  Poland is loosening its coronavirus lockdown as it will reopen parks and forests on Monday before eventually revising rules on the number of customers allowed in shops, a minister has indicated. 
  The country has so far recorded 7,582 coronavirus cases with 286 deaths, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. 
  Poland’s prime minister is expected to announce on Thursday details of the government’s plan for easing restrictions on public life, which were launched to curb the spread of the virus. 
  “Final decisions will be taken today. I think that first, starting from Monday we can expect opening of forests, green areas,” the state assets minister, Jacek Sasin, told private radio RMF on Thursday. Poland will also revise the rules on the number of customers allowed in shops at a time, he added, but did not say when they would come into effect. Sasin also said it is too early to talk about reopening of schools.  
  It comes after protesters in Poland defied the coronavirus lockdown to oppose a proposal that would almost completely ban abortion.

  Like elsewhere, the economic reality of the coronavirus pandemic lockdown is beginning to bite in the Netherlands where the number of people filing for unemployment benefits soared by 42% in March. 
  The country, the eurozone’s fifth largest economy, paid benefits to 37,800 new unemployed in March, an increase of 11,200 from the month before. 
  The strongest increases were among people who used to work in restaurants and bars, and among people under 25 years of age, the Dutch federal employment agency said. on Thursday. 
  The country’s government ordered all restaurants, bars, museums, sport facilities and other public places in the Netherlands to shut down on 15 March in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. They are to remain shut until at least 28 April. To help businesses cope with the economic standstill and to prevent significant layoffs, the Dutch government has said it will cover up to 90% of the wage bill of companies who see a significant decline in sales in the coming months. 
  More than 85,000 companies have already applied for this support. Despite the help, the number of people who lost their jobs in March jumped almost 10% from the previous month to about 283,000, Statistics Netherlands said.

  Nearly two dozen French sailors are being treated in hospital after a large outbreak of Covid-19 on board an aircraft carrier.  
  Some 1,767 marines have been evacuated from the French carrier, the Charles De Gaulle, with at least 668 testing positive for coronavirus.  
  “There are about 20 at the moment in hospital. Out of the 20, one is in the re-animation ward and in a stable case,” spokesman Eric Lavault told RMC radio. 
  On Wednesday, the French armed forces ministry said 1,767 marines - nearly all from the Charles de Gaulle carrier itself - had been evaluated and at least 668 had tested positive for the virus. 
  The vessel set sail for the eastern Mediterranean on 21 January to support French military operations in Iraq and Syria, before deploying to the Atlantic and then the Baltic. It participated in exercises with northern European navies in the Baltic Sea before returning to Toulon two weeks earlier than planned after crew members showed signs of Covid-19 symptoms.

  Let’s kick off with some good news to warm our hearts during these dark times. In the UK, a 99-year-old war veteran has now raised more than £12million for the NHS by walking lengths of his garden. 
   
    
    
     
    
    
   
  Cap Tom Moore, who lives with his family in Bedfordshire, had originally planned to raise £1,000 with his challenge but smashed through his target after his efforts captivated the nation.  
  The veteran, who served in the second world war after being selected for officer training in 1940 and completed postings in India and Sumatra, is walking 10 laps of the 25-metre garden a day with the help of his walking aid and hoped to reach 100 laps by his 100th birthday in April. However, he is likely to reach his target ahead of schedule today.  
  “Our brave nurses and doctors are frontline in this case … this time our army are in doctors and nurses uniforms and they’re doing a marvellous job,” Moore said earlier this week. 
  Here’s my colleague Jessica Murray’s story about Tom from yesterday by which time the war veteran had already raised £9m.

  Profit over people, cost over care: America’s broken healthcare exposed by virus 
  In the wealthiest country in the world, the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the core of a healthcare system that is structurally incapable of dealing with the pandemic. Federal and local governments, health insurers and employers have pledged to help Americans pay their way through this crisis, but to do so requires a dramatic overhaul of a system which has for decades prioritised cost over care.

  In the US meanwhile, retail sales plunged in March while industrial production in the same month suffered its steepest drop since 1946, data showed Wednesday. 
  Other reports pointed to weak homebuilder sentiment and manufacturing conditions, while a Federal Reserve report said American economic activity “contracted sharply”, AFP reports.  
  “The economic data was nothing short of disastrous,” Ann Miletti of Wells Fargo Asset Management told Bloomberg TV. 
  “How long can you sustain the shutdown is what’s on investors’ minds.”

  President Donald Trump has said that he will on Thursday announce the first plans for lifting lockdowns after the US - the worst-hit country with the most virus deaths and infections - passes the “peak on new cases”. 
  The World Health Organization has warned, however, that lifting virus-related restrictions too early could have devastating consequences, with fears of a possible second wave of infections.

  Asian markets fell in early trade on Thursday following overnight woes on Wall Street as more negative US economic data fuelled worries about the full impact of the coronavirus pandemic. 
  There had already been a spate of grim economic forecasts this week, with the IMF warning of the worst global downturn in a century, and poor US economic figures released Wednesday spooked investors further. 
  The woes on Wall Street discouraged traders in Asia, where Tokyo was down 1.2%, Hong Kong lost 0.8&amp; and Sydney dropped 1.4%. 
  Seoul slipped 0.6%, while Taipei shed 0.3% and Shanghai was down 0.1%. 
  The Philippine central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points on Thursday ahead of a 21 May policy meeting, this year’s latest reduction aiming to counter the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The cut takes the rate on the bank’s overnight reverse repurchase facility to 2.75% with effect from Friday.

  Trump wades further into China Covid-19 row as focus turns to easing lockdowns 
  Donald Trump has again questioned China’s transparency over the coronavirus outbreak, casting doubt on the origins of the virus and number of cases, while signalling the US would soon join countries across Europe in easing its lockdown. 
  “Do you really believe those numbers in this vast country called China?” the US president said, when asked about the severity of the US death toll at a White House press briefing. “We report everything, we’re reporting the cases and our reporting is good. We’re reporting every death.” 
  Meanwhile the IMF said on Thursday Asia’s economic growth would grind to a halt for the first time in 60 years, as the crisis takes an “unprecedented” toll on the service sector and major export destinations:

  Australian Prime Minister has just given a press conference in which he announced the following:  
   
   Restrictions to remain in place for at least another four weeks, but easing is on the agenda 
   The government wants increased testing - including those with no symptoms – as well as larger scale contact tracing (downloading the app) and localised lockdown ability to be put in place, before restrictions are loosened. 
   Parliament may return next month 
   
  Slides handed out to media at the conference argue that Australia has one of the highest reported detection rates globally, and estimate that approximately 92% of all symptomatic cases are being detected across the country.  
  Australia has 6457 confirmed cases. The coronavirus death toll is 63 people.  
  The country’s Chief Medical Officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, said the growth rate in cases is “very encouraging”.

  It’s one of the latest efforts around the world to produce pared down, emergency versions of full feature ventilators, which have become more expensive as governments try to outbid each other to purchase them.According to New York governor Andrew Cuomo ventilators are currently selling for $50,000 each.  
  Here are a few others:  
   
   In Afghanistan, a female team of robotics experts announced last week they had created a Covid-19 ventilator made out of Toyota car parts that will cost $400.  
   In Argentina, the National University of Rosario says it has come up with a ventilator that has fewer than 20 components, and has shared its design online.  
   In Colombia, at least five universities have been working separately on their own ventilators and three of them have built prototypes that are already being tested to comply with standards set by national regulators. Ae ventilator produced by Sabana University has been tested successfully on a pig. It must still undergo further tests on animals and humans before it can go into production.

  The Guardian’s Verna Yu has this explainer on what a wet market is – and why Wuhan’s is different: 
   
   At the crack of dawn every day, “wet markets” in China and across Asia come to life, with stall owners touting their wares such as fresh meat, fish, fruits and vegetables, herbs and spices in an open-air setting. 
   The sights and sounds of the wet market form part of the rich tapestry of community life in Asia. They are where local people buy affordable food, or just go for a stroll and meet their neighbours for a chat.  
   While “wet markets”, where water is sloshed on produce to keep it cool and fresh, may be considered unsanitary by western standards, most do not trade in exotic or wild animals and should not be confused with “wildlife markets” – now the focus of vociferous calls for global bans. 
   The now-infamous Wuhan South China seafood market, suspected to be a primary source for spreading Covid-19 in late 2019, had a wild animal section:

  Its number of coronavirus infections has jumped by 1,167 since Monday. While successfully managing its first wave of infections, Singapore overlooked its vast population of foreign workers who live in dormitories that typically house up to 20 men sharing kitchens, toilets and other facilities. Tens of thousands of the workers from Bangladesh, India and other poorer Asian countries are now quarantined in their dormitories or have been moved to alternative sites to reduce crowding. The 447 new coronavirus cases raise Singapore’s total to 3,699. The health ministry said in a statement late Wednesday that the significant rise in cases among foreign workers was expected partly due to ongoing tests at the dormitories. About a fifth of total cases were detected in one single dormitory.

  Jacinda Ardern said that significant restrictions would be kept in place even if the country eases the nationwide one-month lockdown enforced to beat the spread of the coronavirus. 
  New Zealand introduced its highest, level 4 lockdown measures in March, under which offices, schools and all non-essential services like bars, restaurants, cafes and playgrounds were shut down. A decision on whether to lift the lockdown would be made on 20 April. 
  Ardern said if New Zealand moves to the lower level 3 of restriction, it would permit aspects of the economy to reopen in a safe way but there will be no “rush to normality”.

  “Yes,” said the US Senator when asked on MSNBC how she would respond if Biden asked her to run for vice-president. 
  Biden, who was Barack Obama’s vice-president, has vowed to pick a woman to be his running mate and said he would name a committee to help him vet a shortlist of names soon. 
  Several people likely to be in contention have expressed their interest. “I would be an excellent running mate,” said Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia gubernatorial candidate, in an interview published by Elle on Wednesday. Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan told NBC News on Wednesday that she was “fortunate” to be considered for the position.

  “Forty-eight positive cases have been identified” out of the 69 people on board the Flora, Norman Wray told AFP. Wray, who heads the Galapagos Government Council, added that all passengers are crew members, as the ship no longer has tourists on board. “In total, we have 73” confirmed cases and two deaths on the archipelago, Wray said. 
  Ecuador has recorded 7,858 cases and 388 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Guayas province and its capital, port city Guayaquil, have been the hardest hit, comprising about 70 percent of the cases reported since February 29. 
  According to Wray, there are still 1,000 tourists in the Galapagos, most of whom are Ecuadorians who decided to stay during the general lockdown, which has been extended by the national government until April 19. About 1,500 other tourists were evacuated from the islands.

 Summary 
  
   
   Confirmed cases worldwide top 2m. The latest numbers from Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the spread of the virus, put the confirmed global total of cases at 2,063,161. The researchers say at least 136,938 people have died since the start of the outbreak. 
   Asia’s economic growth this year will grind to a halt for the first time in 60 years, the IMF said on Thursday, as the coronavirus crisis takes an “unprecedented” toll on the region’s service sector and major export destinations. 
    The US reports more than 25,000 new cases. Washington’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported 605,390 cases of coronavirus – an increase of 26,385 cases from its previous count – and said the number of deaths has risen by 2,330 to 24,582. 
   US president Donald Trump says some states may reopen before 1 May. There were governors “champing at the bit” to reopen, he said. Trump also reiterated the decision to halt funding to the World Health Organization. 
   The head of the WHO said he regrets US President Donald Trump’s decision to pull funding for the agency, but that now is the time for the world unite in its fight against the new coronavirus. 
   South Korea’s left-leaning ruling party won a landslide victory in Wednesday’s general election, partial results showed, after the coronavirus pandemic turned the political tide in President Moon Jae-in’s favour.

  An explainer now on how WHO funding works and where it goes, as Trump announces US funding to the organisation will be put on hold.  
  The United States’ funding freeze blows a major hole in the World Health Organization’s budget as it attempts to steer the fightback against the coronavirus pandemic.  
  Washington is the biggest single contributor to the United Nations’ health agency, AFP reports.  
  Looking at the specified voluntary contributions that have been fully distributed is one way of making comparisons between the contributions of donors to the WHO. 
  In this sector, the United States is the biggest contributor with $553.1 million, or 14.67%. China’s contribution of $7.9 million amounted to 0.21% of the total.

  The money, which can often be highly earmarked for particular projects, is paid out throughout the year as projects and needs arise.  
  Within the specified voluntary contributions sector in the 2018 and 2019 budget - before the coronavirus crisis - the WHO’s biggest spending outlay was on polio eradication (26.51%). 
  Next came:  
   
   Increasing access to essential health and nutrition services (12.04%);  
   Vaccine-preventable diseases (8.89%);  
   Establishing effective coordination and operations support (6.1%) 
   Preventing and controlling outbreaks (5.96%). 
   
  In terms of regional distribution, it reached those projects via:  
   
   Africa, which received $1.32 billion;  
   The eastern Mediterranean ($1.23bn);  
   The WHO headquarters ($591m);  
   Southeast Asia and Europe ($223m);  
   The western Pacific ($166m) 
   The Americas ($24m).

  Riot police have entered western Sydney’s Villawood Immigration Detention Centre to stop a protest by detainees concerned about a COVID-19 outbreak in the facility. 
  Three detainees in the centre’s Blaxland compound have been holding a rooftop protest since Saturday while others remain on a hunger strike demanding COVID-19 virus testing and the release of detainees, according to the Refugee Action Coalition. 
  “Other detainees in Blaxland have been locked in their rooms,” the Refugee Action Coalition said in a statement on Thursday.

  Observers say Doha is hoping that by carrying on flying when regional competitors are grounded, it will score diplomatic points in an ongoing confrontation with its neighbours. 
  While Qatar Airways is only operating 35 percent of its normal services, it has used spare capacity to carry 17,000 people on almost 60 special charter services for countries with stranded citizens. 
  Germany, France and Britain have all publicly directed citizens to fly home on the Gulf airline and praised Qatar on social media. 
  Qatar Airways has also evacuated US diplomats and other nations’ foreign service staff from Iraq. 
  However, there was criticism of the airline on social media at the start of the month from travellers stuck in New Zealand that the only flight option for those not on a special repatriation flight was a $10,000 business fare.

 Ten Britons and a UK resident stranded in Peru after missing repatriation flight

  Dan Collyns reports for the Guardian: 
  Ten Britons and a UK resident have been left stranded in Cusco, Peru, after missing a UK repatriation flight on Wednesday because a military aircraft which had been sent to collect them refused to let them board after landing and taking off twice, they say. 
  As a result, they missed the repatriation flight which the UK embassy in Peru says is the last. Several such flights have shuttled marooned Britons back to the UK over recent weeks. 
  Chris Ramsay, 29, who was among at least four of the Britons who had been diagnosed with Covid-19, said he felt abandoned by the British foreign office.  
  “It’s been a rollercoaster of emotions and events,” said Ramsay, one of seven Britons who had been staying in the Pariwana hostel which was put under quarantine by Peruvian health authorities in March when two guests tested positive for the virus. Ramsay believes he was infected while under the lockdown.  
  “I woke up expecting to be going home today, then was told ‘no’ after the military flight left, then was told maybe and they’d got it to turn around, then ‘no’ again when it left Cusco without us for the second time,” he said. 
  UK citizen Patricia Pacheco, 61, has been in Cusco since February with her Peruvian husband Roberto and her brother Ian Lindsay, who was diagnosed with Covid-19, and his wife Mary McCarron.  
  Pacheco said UK officials had managed to arrange the Peruvian military flights late on Tuesday after a flight charter company abruptly refused to carry anyone who had tested positive for the virus. 
  “We thought we were getting out now we’ve sunk back to the depths of despair,” said Pacheco, who lives with her husband, a UK resident, in Montgomery, Wales. 
  On Wednesday, the Twitter account of the UK embassy in Peru said: “Today one last UK Government chartered flight took back British nationals and residents from Lima to London. We’ve now helped over 1,200 people get back to the UK from Peru in very challenging circumstances.” 
  It added: “The vast majority of British nationals have now left Peru but we are aware that not everyone who wanted to leave was able to.” 
  Update: The Foreign Office says a dozen passengers were unable to board the military flight from Cusco to Lima because they failed a health screening.

  With the global economy plunged into the worst recession in a century, the Group of 20 nations on Wednesday announced a one-year debt standstill for the world’s poorest nations as they struggle to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. 
  The G20, which brings together the world’s largest economies, also reiterated the pledge to deploy “all available policy tools” to deal with the health and economic crisis caused by Covid-19. 
  The G20 finance ministers and central bankers endorsed “a time-bound suspension of debt service payments for the poorest countries,” and in the communique following their virtual meeting, said, “All bilateral official creditors will participate in this initiative.” 
  Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan, who currently chairs the group, said this means “poor countries don’t need to worry about repaying over the course of the next 12 months.” 
  The initiative will “provide north of $20 billion of immediate liquidity” for poor countries to use “for their health system and support their people facing Covid-19,” he said in a press briefing.

  United Airlines Holdings Inc said on Wednesday that it has cut its flight schedule by 90% in May and expects similar cuts for June as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, and warned that travel demand that is now “essentially at zero shows no sign of improving in the near term,” making job cuts likely, Reuters reports. United disclosed its outlook in a memo to employees that it publicly released. The airline said it flew fewer than 200,000 people in the first two weeks of April, a 97% drop from the more than 6 million people it flew during the same time in 2019. It expects to fly fewer people during the entire month of May than it did on a single day in May of last year, Munoz and Kirby said. “The historically severe economic impact of this crisis means even when travel demand starts to inch back, it likely will not bounce back quickly,” they said. While the $5 billion that United expect to receive in government payroll support under the CARES Act means it is barred from involuntary furloughs before 30 September, the airline indicated that it expects to have to cut payroll after that. It said it will be offering new voluntary leave packages in the coming weeks and voluntary separation programs.

 IMF says Asia will suffer zero economic growth this year 
  
  Asia’s economic growth this year will grind to a halt for the first time in 60 years, as the coronavirus crisis takes an “unprecedented” toll on the region’s service sector and major export destinations, the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday. Asia’s economy is likely to suffer zero growth this year the IMF said in a report on the Asia-Pacific region released on Thursday.

  While Asia is set to fare better than other regions suffering economic contractions, the projection is worse than the 4.7% average growth rates throughout the global financial crisis, and the 1.3% increase during the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, the IMF said. The IMF expects a 7.6% expansion in Asian economic growth next year on the assumption that containment policies succeed, but added the outlook was highly uncertain. Unlike the global financial crisis triggered by the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, the pandemic was directly hitting the region’s service sector by forcing households to stay home and shops to shut down, the IMF said. The region’s export powerhouses were also taking a battering from slumping demand for their goods by key trading partners such as the United States and European countries, it said.

 South Korea’s left-leaning ruling party wins landslide victory 
  
  South Korea’s left-leaning ruling party won a landslide victory in Wednesday’s general election, partial results showed, after the coronavirus pandemic turned the political tide in President Moon Jae-in’s favour.

  The country uses a mix of first-past-the-post seats and proportional representation, but even before all the individual constituencies were decided, Moon’s Democratic party had taken 163 seats in the 300-member National Assembly, an absolute majority. 
  Turnout was 66.2 percent, higher than any parliamentary elections held in the South since 1992. 
  Just a few months ago scandals over power abuse and sluggish economic growth threatened the left-leaning president, with critics calling his dovish approach towards North Korea - despite Pyongyang’s abandonment of its nuclear and ballistic missile test moratoriums - unrealistic. 
  But the South’s relatively quick and effective handling of the epidemic - it has also exported test kits to at least 20 countries - has been a boon for Moon ahead of the parliamentary elections, largely seen as a referendum on his performance. 
  And his so-called “coronavirus diplomacy” - such as recent publicity on his bilateral phone calls with at least 20 state leaders regarding epidemic response - boosted Koreans’ confidence in his administration, said Minseon Ku, a politics scholar at Ohio State University in the United States.

  The tribe first put in place the 8pm Friday to 5am Monday lockdown last weekend for the reservation that lies in parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah and is larger than the state of West Virginia. It came after a nightly curfew was imposed to keep people at home from dusk to dawn during the week. Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez said Wednesday he was thankful most people are adhering to public health orders, but not everyone is complying.The number of coronavirus cases on the Navajo reservation and border towns rose to 921 on Wednesday, with 38 deaths. About 175,000 people live on the Navajo Nation, and Nez said he was working to ensure non-essential business would close as ordered.Tribal police enforced the weekend lockdown by setting up checkpoints in Navajo communities. They issued more than 100 criminal nuisance citations for violating it on Friday and Saturday, Navajo Nation police spokeswoman Christina Tsosie said.Enforcement of the lockdown over Easter weekend was the largest coordinated effort ever for the department, Navajo Police Chief Phillip Francisco said.

  US school administrators across America are trying to re-imagine classrooms and the prospect of reopening schools in the era of social distancing, AP reports.With the majority of schools nationwide shut down, educators are scrambling to plan for the future after a chaotic few weeks that, for many districts, included closing all schools, deciding whether to waive assessment tests and whether and how to do distance learning. Next comes the important question of when schools can safely re-open.

  California Governor Gavin Newsom laid out a few possible scenarios this week for reopening the states public schools to 6 million students, saying the timeline was still unclear but when students do eventually return things will look radically different.The biggest challenge for schools is how to continue physical distancing among children and adults to ensure that kids aren’t going to school, getting infected and then infecting grandma and grandpa, Newsom said.That could mean requiring schools to stagger schedules, with some students arriving in the morning and the rest in the afternoon. Similar conversations are taking place at state school boards across the country. The issue is on Idahos agenda Thursday, and several other states, including Arkansas and Mississippi, are starting to have the discussion, Hull said.

  Mexican assistant health secretary Hugo López-Gatell said Wednesday there has been widespread non-compliance with orders for all non-essential businesses to close. Those firms that don’t comply would be inspected, fined and possibly subject to criminal investigations for endangering the health of employees, he said.  
  While there have been widespread reports that border assembly plants known as maquiladoras had failed to close during the pandemic, López-Gatell cited only one border state Baja California as having a high level of non-compliance.

  Videos of walk-outs and protests at assembly plants have circulated on social media in recent weeks. But López-Gatell said the problem was centred more in Mexico’s industrial central region. In all, 18% of firms in Mexico are considered essential and are allowed to stay open. López Gatell said 50% of those that were supposed to close did so, but about 32% of the remaining companies initially failed to close.Of that one-third, about half closed after being warned, while the other half continue to operate. Mexico has 5,847 confirmed coronavirus cases and almost 450 deaths.

  Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega re-appeared Wednesday after 34 days in which he was not seen in public, AP reports. Ortega made a televised address to the nation in which he said Nicaragua had suffered only one death from the coronavirus pandemic and that the country’s three confirmed cases were imported. There had been concerns about the health of the 74-year-old former guerrilla leader, but he appeared well and was not using a mask during his speech.

  Ortega has refused to adopt the social-distancing and lock-down measures used in other countries, and has in fact encouraged Nicaraguans to participate in mass gatherings. Nicaraguans haven’t stopped working, because if this country stops working, it dies, Ortega said. The government did extend Holy Week school vacations to two weeks; classes are scheduled to resume April 20.Ortega did not comment on how many tests have been carried. Experts suspect there are many undetected cases.

  Trump fans flames of Chinese lab coronavirus theory during daily briefing 
  Donald Trump has fuelled a media theory that the coronavirus pandemic began when the pathogen accidentally escaped a Chinese laboratory, teasing that “more and more we’re hearing the story”. 
  The US president’s TV network of choice, Fox News, has reported that “multiple sources” in the American government believe initial transmission of the virus was bat-to-human in a virology lab in Wuhan. Due to weak safety protocols, an infected lab worker then went to a wet market where the virus spread. 
  When Fox News reporter John Roberts put this to Trump at a press briefing on Wednesday, he replied: “Well, I don’t want to say that John, but I will tell you more and more we’re hearing the story.” 
  The president is notorious for recycling content from Fox News in his remarks or tweets, and it was unclear whether he was privy to any other information to back the claim. He added: “We’ll see. When you say ‘multiple sources’, now there’s a case where you can use the word ‘sources’. But we are doing a very thorough examination of this horrible situation that happened.” 
  Trump added that he did not want to disclose any discussions he had with Chinese president Xi Jinping about the laboratory.

  A Japanese MP has been expelled from his party after it was revealed he had visited a club in a Tokyo red light district, two days after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, declared a state of emergency in an attempt to contain the coronavirus outbreak.Takashi Takai, a 50-year-old lower house member for the Constitutional Democratic party of Japan, admitted he had visited Sexy Cabaret Club in Tokyo’s Kabukicho district on 9 April, media reports said, despite government requests that people refrain from visiting bars, restaurants and clubs as part of efforts to reduce personal contact by 70-80%. Takai submitted a letter of resignation after media reported his visit to the club, but the party rejected it and expelled him instead, Kyodo news agency said.

  On the subject of deaths in US nursing homes, the New York Times has this report, headlined “After Anonymous Tip, 17 Bodies Found at Nursing Home Hit by Virus.”  
   
   The call for body bags came late Saturday. 
   By Monday, the police in a small New Jersey town had gotten an anonymous tip about a body being stored in a shed outside one of the state’s largest nursing homes. 
   When the police arrived, the corpse had been removed from the shed, but they discovered 17 bodies piled inside the nursing home in a small morgue intended to hold no more than four people. 
   “They were just overwhelmed by the amount of people who were expiring,” said Eric C. Danielson, the police chief in Andover, a small township in Sussex County, the state’s northernmost county. 
   The 17 were among 68 recent deaths linked to the long-term care facility, Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation Center I and II, including two nurses, officials said. Of those who died, 26 people had tested positive for the virus.

  Experts say the lack of tracking and transparency has been a major blind spot, and that publicising outbreaks as they happen could not only alert nearby communities and anguished relatives but also help officials see where to focus testing and other safety measures.Such an action by the agencies that oversee the nations 15,000 nursing homes is seen as long overdue, coming more than a month after a nursing home in Washington state became the first Covid-19 hot spot in the US with an outbreak that ultimately killed 43 people and a near-daily drumbeat of new cases that in some cases has forced entire homes to be evacuated.Because the federal government has not been releasing a count, The Associated Press has been keeping its own running tally of nursing home outbreak deaths based on media reports and state health departments. The APs latest count of at least 4,817 deaths is up from about 450 just two weeks ago.

  A new decree took effect in Vietnam on Wednesday introducing fines for the dissemination of ‘fake news’ or rumours on social media. Local authorities have already fined hundreds of people for posting what they described as “fake news” about coronavirus, Reuters reports. But the new decree, drafted in February, supersedes one from 2013 which does not specifically cover ‘fake news’, new guidelines say. A fine of 10-20 million dong ($426-$853), equivalent to around three to six months’ basic salary in Vietnam, will be imposed on people who use social media to share false, untruthful, distorted, or slanderous information, according to the decree. The new rules were not specifically drafted to deal with coronavirus social media comment and extend far beyond that topic, raising concern among human rights groups already heightened by a cybersecurity law that has been in effect since last year. Penalties can now be imposed on anyone sharing publications that are banned from circulation in Vietnam, state secrets, or maps which fail to show Vietnam’s claims in the South China Sea, according to the decree.

  California is launching a $125m disaster relief fund for undocumented immigrants, the first of its kind in the nation, California governor Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday. 
  Undocumented immigrants make up 10% of California’s workforce, Newsom said, but are ineligible for unemployment insurance, pandemic unemployment assistance and federal stimulus support. 
  The governor noted that there was an overrepresentation of the undocumented workforce in essential services, “in the healthcare sector, in the agriculture and food sector, in the manufacturing and logistics sector, and in the construction sector.” 
  “We feel a deep sense of gratitude for people that are in fear of deportation but are still addressing the essential needs of tens of millions of Californians,” he said. 
  More than 2 million undocumented immigrants live in California, making up 6% of the state’s overall population. Last year, undocumented immigrants paid $2.5bn in local and state taxes, Newsom said. But still amid this crisis, many find themselves in the impossible situation of having to choose between healthcare and legal status, or continuing essential work without protections.

 Amazon to close French warehouses over coronavirus concerns

  The online giant said in a statement that “this week, we are requesting employees of our distribution centres to stay at home. In the longer term, we will evaluate the impact of that [court] decision for them and our French logistic network”. 
  Amazon’s French warehouses are to be shut down for five days from Thursday to carry out a deep clean and to “take all the necessary measures to guarantee the health and safety of staff”, the company said. 
  Management said the 10,000 full- and part-time staff would continue to be paid.

  Supermarket shelves have been short of flour and baking supplies for weeks because many have taken up baking as a hobby during New Zealand’s four-week lockdown, which has imposed some of the most strict restrictions anywhere in the world. 
  The cake – which features a lurid shade of pink lipstick, wavy black liquorice hair and googly blue candy eyes – was based on a picture of the prime minister on the cover of a recent biography of Ardern, An Extraordinary Leader. 
  The coup de grace was a set of what appeared to be real teeth.

  Irish police made one of their largest drug seizures of the year when a car tried to evade one of their checkpoints set up to enforce strict measures to curtail the spread of the coronavirus, Reuters reports. The police have been given new powers to enforce stay-at-home restrictions and increased the already large number of checkpoints over the Easter holiday weekend, mainly to deter trips to holiday homes. But cocaine with a street value of around €500,000 (US$545,700) was recovered when police caught up with a car that sped away from a checkpoint in Dublin’s city centre in the early hours of Tuesday before colliding with a wall near the city’s River Liffey, 2 km (1.2 miles) away.  
  Three people were arrested, and divers later recovered two handguns following a search of the riverbed, police said in a statement. Police say there have been 144 incidents that started “as potential breaches of the regulations, but during the incidents other offences were disclosed”. On 8 April, the first day of the increased Easter operation, police seized 20,000 smuggled cigarettes from a driver at a checkpoint in County Mayo. Two days earlier, on April 6, police found cocaine with a street value of about €51,000 after stopping a car at a checkpoint in southern Waterford.

  A strange story from Kashmir now:  
  Authorities have ordered the felling of tens of thousands of poplar trees that account for nearly a third of the region’s forests, over fears of a convergence of respiratory allergies and the spread of the coronavirus, Reuters reports.  
  But doctors and scientists say the imported trees’ pollen and drifting seeds are not a particularly significant allergy problem, and that widespread forest losses may be the bigger threat.

  Widespread felling of the trees kicked off after the Jammu and Kashmir High Court earlier this month said health threats from poplars should be examined and, if supported, female poplar trees, which produce drifting cotton-like clumps of seeds in the spring, should be felled. The court decision was the result of a public-interest petition filed by a Srinagar lawyer, stating that poplar pollen could create “havoc for humans with respiratory diseases” and potentially aggravate Covid-19 infections.  
  Environmentalists and doctors have pointed out that male, rather than female, trees produce pollen, and said that neither the pollen nor seeds from the tree represented a more significant respiratory threat than other spring-blooming plants.  
  The Jammu and Kashmir region has so far seen about 300 confirmed cases of the virus, and four deaths, according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

  Vietnam’s VietJet Air and state carrier Vietnam Airlines will resume some domestic flights from Thursday after the government eased a 15-day lockdown for some parts of the Southeast Asian country. Late on Wednesday, Vietnam’s government extended a two-week period of social distancing for 12 provinces in the country, including capital Hanoi and the southern business hub of Ho Chi Minh City, but lifted those measures for most rural areas. The Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV) had previously said that domestic flights would remain suspended to fully comply with social distancing measures. But following Wednesday’s announcement, the CAAV granted permission for four domestic airlines to resume flights between key routes, including Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and the central city of Danang.

 LA mayor says concerts and sporting events unlikely to resume until 2021 
  
  Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Wednesday it is unlikely concerts and sporting events will resume until at least 2021, as the city continues to fight the coronavirus pandemic. 
  “It’s difficult to imagine us getting together in the thousands anytime soon, so I think we should be prepared for that this year,” he told Wolf Blitzer on The Situation Room. “Until there’s either a vaccine, some sort of pharmaceutical intervention, or herd immunity, the science is the science. And public health officials have made very clear we have miles and miles to walk before we can be back in those environments.” 
  Garcetti’s comments echo those of New York City mayor Bill de Blasio and California governor Gavin Newsom, both of whom said it will be a long time before gatherings of 100 or more people are commonplace again. 
  President Donald Trump has expressed the desire to reopen the country by 1 May, but governors and city officials have increasingly put forward longer timelines.

 Man who lost mother to coronavirus files case against Belarus leader 
  
  A man living France who lost his mother to the coronavirus has filed a police case against the leader of his native Belarus, accusing President Alexander Lukashenko of failing to take adequate measures to fight the spread of the pandemic, Reuters reports.

  Aleksander Matveyev said he had reported Lukashenko to Belarus police for investigation over the death of his mother, Lydia Matveyeva, 68, who died on 2 April in a hospital in Vitebsk, a city in northeast Belarus. “Lukashenko did not take the necessary measures in time,” her son told Reuters in a video call. “And if this person who exercises power does not take those measures, he does nothing, he should be held accountable like any other citizen.” Lukashenko, in power since 1994, has been one of the world leaders most publicly sceptical about the need for strong action to curb the coronavirus. The Belarus health ministry, which encourages people to reduce contact to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, says 36 people in Belarus have died of it. But Lukashenko has said all victims had other health problems. On Monday he said he believed nobody in Belarus would be killed by the virus. Matveyeva’s death certificate, an image of which was sent to Reuters by her family, records her “main cause of death” as “coronavirus”. Lukashenko’s office and the interior ministry did not respond to a request for comment. A person who answered the phone in the hospital director’s office declined to comment on Matveyeva’s death.

 Nearly 700 sailors from French aircraft carrier test positive 
  
  Nearly 700 sailors assigned to the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle’s naval group have tested positive for the coronavirus, the armed forces ministry said on Wednesday. The ministry said 1,767 mariners, nearly all from the Charles de Gaulle itself, had been tested and results showed at least 668 to be infected with the new coronavirus. Results are still not in from a third of the tests, Reuters reports. “Thirty one personnel are today in hospital,” it said in a statement. “More tests are being carried out.”

  The carrier arrived home in Toulon two weeks earlier than expected after about 40 crew members showed signs of Covid-19 symptoms.  
  Sick crew members had been placed under strict medical observation on board the nuclear-powered carrier and a team equipped to carry out the first tests airlifted to the vessel.  
  Crew from the Charles de Gaulle and the frigate Chevalier Paul were now in confinement within their naval base, while the pilots of the carrier’s warplanes and helicopters were also in quarantine. The navy chief had ordered an investigation, the ministry said.

 Summary 
  
  Hello and welcome to today’s live coronavirus pandemic coverage. The world has passed another sombre milestone, with more than 2 million coronavirus cases confirmed worldwide.  
  Trump, meanwhile, held a press conference in which he expressed doubt over China’s coronavirus death toll in response to reporter asking why US fatalities account for a fifth of the global total.  
  “Do you really believe those numbers from this vast country called China? And that they have a certain number of cases and a certain number of deaths. Does anyone really believe that,” Trump said. 
  Trump doubled down on his decision to halt funding to the World Health Organization and announced that US governors will be given new guidelines on Thursday and some states may reopen before 1 May.  
  I’ll be bringing you the latest developments from around the world as they happen.  
  A reminder that I welcome news tips, questions and comments on Twitter @helenrusllivan.  
   
   Confirmed cases worldwide top 2m. The latest numbers from Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the spread of the virus, put the confirmed global total of cases at 2,047,731. The researchers say at least 133,354 people have died since the start of the outbreak. 
   The US reports more than 25,000 new cases. Washington’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported 605,390 cases of coronavirus – an increase of 26,385 cases from its previous count – and said the number of deaths has risen by 2,330 to 24,582. 
   US president Donald Trump says some states may reopen before 1 May. There were governors “champing at the bit” to reopen, he said. Trump also reiterated the decision to halt funding to the World Health Organization.  
   The head of the WHO said on Wednesday he regrets US President Donald Trump’s decision to pull funding for the agency, but that now is the time for the world unite in its fight against the new coronavirus.  
   New York residents will be required to wear face coverings when they are out in public and coming in close contact with other people, Governor Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday. The order takes effect on Friday.  
   G20 finance ministers agree to suspend poorer countries’ debt payments. The measure will be in effect from 1 May until the end of the year as they prepare for increased spending on healthcare systems. 
   The UK hospital death toll rises by 761. The Department of Health and Social Care says a total of 12,868 people have now died in hospitals around the UK. The 761 new deaths announced on Wednesday represent a fall on the equivalent figure reported yesterday; 778. The figure is likely to rise once deaths in other settings are taken into account. 
   New York City revises its death toll sharply upwards to more than 10,000 people. It added 3,778 people who were not tested but who are nevertheless presumed to have died from Covid-19. 
   Italy reports 578 new deaths. The number of fatalities in Italy rises by 578 on Wednesday, 24 fewer than the increase seen on Tuesday, taking the death toll to 21,645. 
   The European Union’s medicine regulator estimates it could take a year for a vaccine to be available for widespread use. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has previously claimed a vaccine could be on the market “before autumn”. 
   The 107th edition of the Tour de France is postponed until August.the world governing body, the UCI, says the opening stage will now start on 29 August and the finale will take place on 20 September. It was due to begin in Nice on 27 June and conclude in Paris on 19 July. 
   Oil slumps despite production cuts. US oil prices tumble to 18-year lows of $19.20 (£15.33) a barrel and the benchmark price for Brent crude drop by 5% to $28 a barrel amid gloomy forecasts for demand during the pandemic. 
   Canadian economy slides 9% in a month. Its statistics agency says the country’s economy suffered a decline of nearly 9% in March – the worst figure ever recorded. 
   Three rounds of EU-UK Brexit talks are scheduled. Both sides say they remain committed to reviewing progress in June.

113,health,'More scary than coronavirus': South Korea's health alerts expose private lives,"As the number of coronavirus cases in South Korea exceeded 6,000 this week, there was a rise, too, in complaints about information overload in the form of emergency virus text alerts that have included embarrassing revelations about infected people’s private lives. Health authorities and district offices across the country are sending “safety guidance texts” from early morning to late at night, reminding people to wash their hands thoroughly and not to touch their faces with unwashed hands. But for many people, the texts – while intended as a public health service – are fuelling social stigma and in some cases, leading to speculation over extra-marital affairs. Much of the criticism centres on messages that trace the movements of people who have recently been diagnosed with the virus.   Related: Kim Jong-un sister condemns 'frightened dog' South Korea in first public statement    “A woman in her 60s has just tested positive,” reads a typical text, “Click on the link for the places she visited before she was hospitalised,” it adds. Clicking on the link takes the user to the website of a district office that lists the places the patient had visited before testing positive. This avalanche of information has included some embarrassing revelations. One involved a man in his 50s who returned from Wuhan province in China – where the outbreak started – with his 30-year-old secretary. Both were infected in the early days of the epidemic. In another case, reported by the BBC, one alert said a man contracted the virus from an instructor during a sexual harassment class. As South Korean media pored over their movements, citizens looked on with a mixture of horror and fascination as their private lives were laid bare, leading to speculation that they were having an affair and that the secretary had undergone plastic surgery. In another text that captured people’s imagination, a woman in her 60s reportedly went to work as normal, attended a wedding and had lunch at a hotel buffet restaurant with friends, despite having been recently hospitalised with injuries she said she had sustained in a car accident.   Related: 'We're treated like criminals': South Korean sect feels coronavirus backlash    The woman, who then tested positive for Covid-19, was accused by South Korean internet users of committing insurance fraud – allegations she denied publicly after TV reporters managed to track her down. A man in his 30s who tested positive became the target of online taunts about his sexual behaviour after authorities said in a text alert that they had been unable to track his movements after he arrived at Seoul’s main railway station from the capital’s airport. Since the area near the station is known for prostitution, the man, known only by his case number, was repeatedly accused on online forums of paying for sex. In fact, he had simply eaten at a restaurant in the neighbourhood, health authorities said, blaming the earlier confusion over his whereabouts on a technical glitch. The text alerts are also affecting shops and restaurants that infected people visited before their diagnosis was confirmed. While the texts do not identify the patients – other than giving their gender, age range and assigning them a case number – they do reveal the names of shops and restaurants they visited before they were tested. While restaurants that had been named closed temporarily for fumigation, they say their association with the virus could put them out of business. Fraudsters are now playing on those fears. A man claiming to be infected with Covid-19 called several restaurants in the Mapo district of Seoul warning that their business would suffer if he told health authorities he had eaten there, and demanded money in return for his silence. Police are investigating the case but have yet to locate the suspect. “I find myself eavesdropping on customers’ conversations these days, just in case they turn out to be a cult member or a fraudster,” said Kim Na-hee, the owner of a restaurant in the capital. Most of South Korea’s cases have been linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a religious sect. Kim added: “I thought I only had to protect my health, but now I think there are other things more scary than the coronavirus.”  "
114,health,"UK in danger of failing a generation, says child health study","Rising violence, drug use and mental health problems among young people in England mean society is in danger of “failing a generation”, children’s doctors have said. English teenagers are increasingly likely to be injured in youth violence and the UK is lagging behind other European countries on measures including infant mortality, according to UK-wide research into the state of child health by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. The numbers of children in poverty, under child protection plans and being “looked after” have increased since its 2017 report, and progress on mental health among five- to 15-year-olds has stalled or reversed. “It’s not a pretty sight,” said the president of the college, Prof Russell Viner. “On many vital measures we risk lagging behind other European countries. We’re in danger of failing a generation if we don’t turn this situation around. The government has made welcome commitments on childhood obesity and young people’s mental health but we need to see delivery in these and other areas.” Separate figures from Childline revealed that in 2018-19 653 children under 11 contacted its freephone number with suicidal thoughts and feelings, an increase of 87% since 2015-16. Across all age groups it delivered 24,447 counselling sessions to young people overwhelmed by a sense of despair, an increase of a quarter over three years. Esther Rantzen, Childline’s founder, said that when she launched the charity in 1986 most calls related to pain caused by someone else, including abuse, bullying or neglect. “Over the last 10 years we have seen a rise in the number of children describing their feelings of such intense unhappiness that they tell Childline they want to end their own lives,” she said. “It is deeply disturbing that we have reached a point where, on average, 67 children a day are receiving help for suicidal thoughts and feelings.” The royal college study claims to be the largest ever compilation of data on the health of babies, children and young people in the UK. It found that the health of children who live in deprived areas is largely worse than those in more prosperous places and that inequalities have widened since 2017. More children are undertaking unpaid care work, with the biggest increase in Scotland where the rate has almost doubled since 2017. The college said the slide in conditions was rarely seen in developed countries and it blamed deep cuts to local authority budgets that are used to finance public health initiatives and community services. The NSPCC said it was “scandalous that progress in children’s health is not improving and shameful that the most disadvantaged are seeing the biggest retreat”. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “We want every child to have the best start in life, regardless of their background, and tackling health inequalities is a priority for the government. “Early intervention is key and we are taking urgent steps to improve child health. We have launched the most ambitious plan in the world to cut childhood obesity by half by 2030, we are transforming children’s mental health to treat to give 70,000 more children access to services by next year and we are improving maternity services.” Stabbings and injuries with sharp objects have risen in England among 15- to 19-year-olds since 2014, the study found. The likelihood of such an injury was unchanged in Wales and falling in Scotland and Northern Ireland. By contrast, the likelihood of a 17- to 19-year-old being harmed in a road traffic accident is falling across England, Wales and Scotland. The figures reflect the rise in serious knife crime across England, with 47,000 offences involving a knife or sharp instrument recorded in England and Wales in 2018-19, the highest number since 2011. The danger from knives is increasing only in England and there have been decreases in incidents in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.   Graphic   The report includes some signs of hope: the treatment of chronic medical conditions including asthma, diabetes and epilepsy is improving. Children in England, Wales and Scotland have healthier teeth, and smoking and consumption of alcohol is falling among children in England and Scotland, while teen pregnancies are falling across all four home nations. However, on infant mortality (children under one) the UK is fifth from bottom among 27 European countries. Among its recommendations to tackle the problem, the college said every child should receive a minimum of five mandatory contacts from a health visitor, universal midwifery visiting services should be offered for new mothers and the government should require the fortification of flour with folic acid. “The harsh reality is that in terms of health and wellbeing, children born in the UK are often worse off than those born in other comparably wealthy countries,” said Dr Ronny Cheung, a clinical lead for the RCPCH and a co-author of the State of Child Heath 2020 report. “This is especially true if the child is from a less well-off background. Throughout the world, the number of babies dying in their first year has been steadily falling for decades, as incomes rise and mothers and children receive better healthcare. Yet UK infant mortality rates have stalled, and in England they actually got worse between 2016 and 2017. For a high-income nation such as ours, that should be a major wakeup call.” The college called for government investment to “minimise social risk factors, early identification and intervention in those at risk, and a coordinated approach across public and social services including health, policing, social care and youth services.” It said this approach had proven successful in Scotland, where youth violence in 20- to 24-year-olds has decreased following the introduction of a violence reduction unit in 2005. "
115,health,"Covid-19 self-test could allow return to work, say health officials","Self-testing at home to find out whether somebody has had Covid-19 is an efficient way to find out if they are safe to return to work, a senior health official has said. Prof Yvonne Doyle, the medical director of Public Health England, told the health select committee that finger-prick home tests would be available very soon. “We expect that to come within a couple of weeks, but I wouldn’t want to promise on that,” she said. It was “critical to understand what is going on and allow people to return to work” she said. Self-testing was not new and was well understood by the public, with routine tests available such as the pregnancy test. “The intention is to allow people to do as much of this as they validly can. It is by far the most efficient way, if the technology will support it,” she said. On Wednesday Prof Sharon Peacock, from Public Health England, told MPs on the science and technology committee that a home test to detect antibodies indicating somebody has had Covid-19 was being evaluated this week in Oxford to make sure it worked as well as is claimed and would be available next week. Government advisers later cautioned that the test might not be ready so quickly. But the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the government has bought 3.5m antibody tests and will buy more. Governments around the world are all seeking better and faster tests to show whether people have the disease or have had had it and recovered. Singapore developed an antibody test as early as February. The US Covid-19 co-ordinator, Dr Deborah Birx, has said the US government is interested in it, and private US companies are also developing antibody tests. They include California-based Biomerica, which is selling to Europe and the Middle East, and New York-based Chembio Diagnostics, which is selling to Brazil. “Some are developed now. We are looking at the ones in Singapore,” Birx said on Monday at a White House press briefing. “We are very quality-oriented. We don’t want false positives.” UK firms and academics have also developed self-test kits for Covid-19 that are expected to be available to buy in the coming weeks or months. One cheap test is made by Mologic, a diagnostic test firm based in Bedford. Another kit has been developed by researchers at three UK universities led by Brunel University. Mologic has produced the first prototypes of an antibody test for Covid-19, building on its experience of developing a rapid test kit for Ebola. Assessment and validation of the test began this week at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and St George’s, University of London. The company said it would take three to four months before the test is available in the UK and other countries. It will cost £1 in the UK and will be as simple to use as a home pregnancy test but will use saliva or blood rather than urine, with results ready in 10 minutes.  Mologic, which received £1m from the UK government to develop the test, will be able to make 8m kits a year at facilities in the UK and Senegal. In Senegal it will be sold for less than $1. “These tests could be a game-changer for diagnosis and follow-up of patients both in hospital and in the community, allowing us to detect cases early and isolate patients and their families rapidly,” said Dr Emily Adams, a senior lecturer in diagnostics for infectious disease at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. The test kit developed by researchers at Brunel University London, Lancaster University and the University of Surrey is based on science evaluated in the Philippines to check chickens for viral infections. The battery-operated handheld device processes nasal or throat swabs that are inserted into it, and delivers the results within 30 to 45 minutes via a smartphone app. The team has approached UK, US and European regulators for approval and is in talks with 60 manufacturers. It could be available to the public within a few weeks. The device will be priced at £100 and can test six people at once. The test can detect the virus in individuals who show no symptoms because it recognises the DNA structure of the virus in the samples."

117,health,"Nurses, surgeons, janitors: the first US health workers to die from Covid-19"," Kaiser Health News   America’s healthcare workers are dying. In some states, medical staff account for as many as 20% of known coronavirus cases. From doctors to hospital cleaners and from nursing home aides to paramedics, those most at risk have already helped save thousands of lives. Not all these medical professionals survive their encounters with patients. Hospitals are overwhelmed, workers lack protective equipment and some staff suffer from underlying health conditions that make them vulnerable to this pernicious virus. Health authorities in the US have no consistent way of tallying the deaths of healthcare workers. As of 14 April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 27 deaths among health workers – but our reporting shows that is likely a vast undercount. Lost on the frontline is a collaboration between the Guardian and Kaiser Health News that aims to document the lives of healthcare workers in the US who die from Covid-19, and to understand why so many are falling victim to the pandemic. These are some of the first tragic cases. We are creating a database and will investigate and record new cases as this project unfolds.     Kim King-Smith.

An only child, she grew up close to her extended family, including her cousins Hassana Salaam-Rivers and Sharonda Salaam. After Salaam developed multiple sclerosis, King-Smith visited her every day. “She’d bring her sweets that she wasn’t supposed to have and share them with her,” Salaam-Rivers said. King-Smith’s desire to care for others was the reason she became an electrocardiogram technician, her cousin added. “If a friend of a friend or family member went to the hospital, she would always go and visit them as soon as her shift was over,” she said. In March, King-Smith cared for a patient she said had symptoms of Covid-19; she soon fell ill herself and tested positive for the virus. It seemed like a mild case at first, and she stayed in touch with family via FaceTime while trying to isolate from her husband, Lenny. On 29 March, Salaam-Rivers checked in on her cousin and noticed she was struggling to breathe. She urged her to call an ambulance. After King-Smith was hospitalized, she exchanged text messages with her mother and cousin. As the day progressed, her messages carried increasingly grave news, Salaam-Rivers said. Then she stopped responding.  – Danielle Renwick     Curtis Hunt.

It wasn’t part of his job description as a social worker. It was just one of the ways he went “above and beyond”, said Daena Murphy, his supervisor at Cornell Scott-Hill health center. “He had a beautiful voice,” she said. “He was just a wonderful person – funny, engaging, always a huge smile on his face.” Hunt, the youngest of four brothers, earned his master’s in social work from Fordham University at 52, and was baptized at his brother’s Pentecostal church at 54. He was a devoted uncle who doted on his dog and cat, Mya and Milo. It’s unclear how Hunt got infected, but one patient he worked with tested positive for Covid-19, as did two co-workers, according to Dr Ece Tek, another supervisor at Cornell Scott-Hill health center. Hunt died on 23 March, one week after developing flu-like symptoms, said his brother John Mann Jr. – Melissa Bailey     Araceli Buendia Ilagan.

Araceli Buendia Ilagan emigrated from their hometown Baguio, in the Philippines, to the US before Buendia was born, but she remained close to her family and communicated with them nearly every day. “She was one of the smartest people I ever knew,” Buendia, 27, said. Buendia Ilagan, who at one point looked into adopting her niece so she could join her and her husband the United States, encouraged Buendia to become a nurse, and talked her through grueling coursework in anatomy and physiology. Buendia is now a nurse in London. Buendia Ilagan was also demanding. “Whenever she visited the Philippines, she wanted everything to be organized and squeaky clean,” Buendia said. The last time the two spoke, in late March, Buendia Ilagan didn’t mention anything about feeling ill. Instead, the two commiserated over their experiences of treating patients with Covid-19; as always, her aunt offered her advice on staying safe while giving the best possible care.

Like many in the region, Christ hospital had an influx of Covid-19 patients and faced a shortage of ventilators and masks. Dela Cruz was a geriatric psychiatrist and didn’t work in coronavirus wards. But he continued to see patients in person. In early April, Dela Cruz, who lived alone, complained only of migraines, his friends said. Within a week his condition worsened, and he was put on a ventilator at a nearby hospital. He died soon after. Friends said he may have been exposed at the hospital. (In a statement, hospital representatives said he didn’t treat Covid-19 patients.) Dela Cruz, the oldest of 10 siblings, came from a family of healthcare professionals. His friends and family – from Cebu, Philippines, to Teaneck, New Jersey – remembered his jovial personality on Facebook. He won “best doctor of the year” awards, played tennis, and cooked traditional Cebu dishes. Nida Gonzales, a colleague, said he always supported people, whether funding a student’s education or running a church mental health program. “I feel like I lost a brother,” she said. – Ankita Rao     J Ronald Verrier.

Workers at St Barnabas hospital struggled to find masks and gowns as staff set up makeshift morgues in the parking lot. (Many nurses continue to make cloth masks.) Born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Verrier emigrated to the United States and had worked at St Barnabas for the last two decades, overseeing the general surgery residency program. A towering presence with a wide, dimpled smile, Verrier was a natural mentor who was known to drop into patients’ rooms for impromptu birthday parties. “He kept pushing me forward,” said Dr Christina Pardo, Verrier’s cousin and an obstetrician and gynecologist in New York. “I would call him and say, ‘I swear I failed that test,’ and he would laugh. He was my confidence when I didn’t have it.” The Verrier family stretches across continents and Verrier kept them close, zipping around to a niece’s wedding in Belgium, a baptism in Florida and another wedding in Montreal in recent years. He had recently ferried medical supplies to Haiti, a decade after he had traveled to his homeland to tend to victims of the country’s devastating 2010 earthquake. Verrier helped steer St Barnabas’s efforts to increase its capacity as Covid-19 cases increased. “He was at the hospital every day,” Dr Ridwan Shabsigh, the surgery department’s chair, said. “This was a nonstop effort.” In early April, Verrier discovered he was infected. After developing symptoms, he continued to call into meetings from his home in Woodmere, New York. Shabsigh spoke with Verrier on 7 April, and said his spirits were high. The next day, he was rushed to a nearby hospital where he died. – Sarah Varney     Vianna Thompson.

Two weeks later, she was lying in an intensive care unit, with a colleague holding her hand. Thompson and Bruce McAllister, the man she treated, were among three VA healthcare workers in Reno, Nevada, who died within a two-week span from the novel coronavirus. “It’s pretty devastating. It’s surreal. Reno’s not that big of a city,” said Robyn Underhill, a night nurse who worked with Thompson. Thompson was born Vianna Fye in Port Huron, Michigan. She met her husband, Bob, in 1991 on the Osan airbase in South Korea, where she was a veterinary technician and cared for military police dogs. They bonded over two-step dancing and country music. Vianna was a proud mother who worked long hours to provide for her three sons, buying them saxophones, drums and keyboards so they could play jazz and country music. “She was just sweet, big-hearted, caring, unselfish,” Bob Thompson said. Vianna came to work with a cough on 29 March, a day after McAllister died. ”We were all very concerned,” Underhill said. “Call it intuition, call it ‘Spidey sense’, but I knew that moment that she was coughing that this was not going to end well.” That shift was Thompson’s last. Over the next four days, she wrestled with fever, weakness and shortness of breath. The following Thursday, she texted her husband from the bedroom: “Call the ambulance, I can hardly breathe.” She was taken to the VA hospital and put on a ventilator. On 17 March, as her organs began to fail, Thompson’s colleagues connected to Bob on FaceTime so he could say goodbye. As a veteran, she qualified for an “honor flight”, in which the patient’s body is covered with a black box and wheeled through the hospital while others line up and salute. Because of the infectious nature of the coronavirus, a US flag could not be safely draped over her body, so a family friend walked in front of her and carried it. Thompson said the ceremony drew more people lining the hallways than staff had seen in 20 years. “God’s getting a hell of a nurse,” he said. – MB     Alvin Simmons.

An army veteran who had served in the first Gulf war, Simmons loved karaoke and doted on his three grandchildren, Wilcox said. “He was a dedicated, hard-working individual who had just changed his life around” since a prison stint, she said. According to Wilcox, Simmons began developing symptoms shortly after cleaning the room of a woman he believed was infected with the novel coronavirus. (In an email, a hospital spokesperson said it had “no evidence to suggest that Mr Simmons was at a heightened risk of exposure to Covid-19 by virtue of his training or employment duties” and that he was the hospital’s first diagnosed case of Covid-19.) On 11 March, he visited the emergency room with flu-like symptoms, Wilcox said. Over the next few days, his breathing became more labored and he began to cough up blood. He was rushed to the hospital on 13 March, where he subsequently received a Covid-19 diagnosis. Simmons died on 17 March. – DR     Daisy Doronila.

She loved fashionable clothes and eating seafood on the waterfront in New York City, her daughter said.  “Daisy could handle herself,” said the county director of corrections, Ron Edwards, describing her as sophisticated, intelligent and compassionate. “If someone got obnoxious with her, she’d put them in their place and call for help if she needed to.” Like many jails and prisons, the facility where Doronila worked has been hit hard by the virus: as of 10 April, 27 inmates and 68 staff members had tested positive. Four people who worked at the jail, including Doronila, have died, according to officials. Doronila, a devout Catholic who had been planning a trip to Israel with friends from church, developed a cough in mid-March. One doctor told her she probably had strep throat; another said fever wasn’t high enough to merit a coronavirus test. She offered to return to work, but as the days went by, her condition grew worse. On 21 March, she was hospitalized for shortness of breath. The next day, she was put on a ventilator. Two weeks later, she passed away.  Rendor said she and her mother were looking forward to sharing the next chapters in life together. For her mother, retirement at 65. For Rendor, marriage and perhaps starting her own family. “It was about to get really, really good,” she said. – Christina Jewett     Jeff Baumbach.

He was exposed to so many things, and we never got anything,” said his wife and fellow nurse, Karen. Baumbach even sent a dry text to Karen: “I love wearing a mask every day.” In March, Baumbach was notified that a co-worker had Covid-19. He soon began to develop symptoms; he and Karen tested positive. Karen came down with body aches and congestion. Jeff had a fever and cough. Their home, once the site of countless family brunches and barbecues, where Jeff and his children solved huge jigsaw puzzles, was now sealed off from the outside world. Their daughter Kaila, 26, moved out as a precaution, and she didn’t communicate with her dad when he was sick. “I thought he was invincible,” Kaila said.  On 26 March, Karen brought Baumbach to the emergency room, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia. He chose to recuperate at home. On 31 March, he collapsed in the bathroom. “It went downhill really fast,” said Karen, who took him to the hospital. Unable to enter the building, she stayed in her car and received updates by phone. Kaila waited in another car nearby. Baumbach was connected to a ventilator, but it had little effect. Eventually, Karen was allowed to don full protective gear and say goodbye in person. She returned home alone, still in quarantine. The next evening, Kaila asked dozens of friends and family members to drive along her parents’ street and shine their phone flashlights. Filled with grief and gratitude, Karen cried as she peered out of an upstairs window at the glittering lines of cars crawling in both directions past her home.  – CJ     Debbie Accad.

On 16 March, Accad, 72, a clinical nursing coordinator at the Detroit VA medical center, told relatives that she felt ill. Four days later, she was hospitalized with pneumonia. She told her family that she had tested positive for Covid-19, and asked them to pray for her. The family felt helpless watching their beloved matriarch suffer from afar, said her niece, April Amada, who lives in the Philippines. Accad was born in Alimodian, a Philippine town known for its sweet bananas. The eldest of four children, she graduated from Central Philippine University with a nursing degree in 1969. Two years later, she moved to Chicago through a “fly now, pay later” program, joining tens of thousands of Filipino nurses who have migrated to the United States. She later relocated to Taylor, Michigan, where she married William Accad, with whom she raised four children. Accad was the “pillar of the family”, Amada said. She sent money home to relatives, and put Amada’s mother through nursing school. A visit from Accad – known to relatives as Tita Debbie – meant unli-kainan, or “unlimited food”. Accad served up big American breakfasts and spicy kielbasa with cabbage. Mark, Accad’s son, said his mother had diabetes, a risk factor for Covid-19 complications. He believes his mother was exposed by infected co-workers, though that has not been confirmed. The Department of Veterans Affairs is facing serious shortages in personal protective equipment for workers, according to internal memos obtained by the Wall Street Journal, though the VA has told reporters that it was taking proper precautions. Accad “died doing what she loved most – caring for people”, said Mark. – Melissa Bailey • We are aiming to document the life of every healthcare worker in America who dies from Covid-19.

118,health,'We have nothing': Papua New Guinea's broken health system braces for Covid-19,"The first that staff at Nonga General Hospital in Papua New Guinea heard that they had been treating someone with coronavirus, was when they saw the country’s prime minister announce it in televised press conference on Monday. They had been treating the patient, a volunteer health worker at the hospital, for pneumonia. She originally came into the hospital in late March, but recovered and was discharged, before her symptoms worsened and she was readmitted. “This person wasn’t put into isolation or even a different ward. She has been walking around freely in the past few days and talking with us, so we are scared. We all left the hospital and are waiting for someone to come and explain what is happening,” said Margaret Melke, a nurse in Rabaul district, where Nonga Hospital is located.     Margaret Melke has been a nurse in East New Britain for more than 40 years. She is also the Union Leader for New Guinea Islands. PNG. East New Britain is a province of Papua New Guinea Photograph: Kalo Fainu/The Guardian    The woman, who is now recovering at her home, is the second confirmed case of Covid-19 in Papua New Guinea, a nation of roughly eight million people, about 150km north of the Australian mainland. The first was an Australian mining worker, who had flown into the country. But this time the infected person is a local, who had not recently travelled abroad. The case was detected in a village near Rabaul, a harbourside town on the island of East New Britain. The prospect of the arrival of coronavirus in a country with just 500 doctors and around 5,000 hospital beds and which struggles to deal with even routine illnesses has terrified the public.

Photograph: Kalo Fainu/The Guardian    Health workers are asking how the nation’s fractured health system, which routinely leaves clinics without soap or disinfectant and where nurses report using nappies as gauze to mop up blood and rice packets in lieu of gloves, would deal with an outbreak. The country is already dealing with outbreaks of malaria, dengue fever, drug-resistant tuberculosis and polio. “When one [Covid-19 case] is confirmed, it is a disaster for us. It is already an outbreak,” said Melke, who has spent more than 40 years working in Papua New Guinea’s beleaguered health system and is the Nursing Union Leader for New Guinea Islands. “We are the frontline, but we do not have safety equipment to protect us, so how can we save others? We put our own families at risk.” ‘I will look out for them, I can die’ After the case was announced by the prime minister on Monday, staff at Nonga General Hospital walked out of the building, refusing to continue working until they knew more. Deputy chief physician at Nonga Hospital, Dr Alexander Maha, confirmed there was a walkout of staff, but said things settled quickly and staff were given the option to leave if they did not wish to be part of the frontline team. He also said it was protocol for the cases to be announced by the prime minister. Maha says a section of one of the wards has now been cleared and set up as an isolation area for suspected Covid-19 cases.     A woman holds her child as they wait for medicine at the dispensary at Warangoi Helth Clinic. Photograph: Kalo Fainu/The Guardian    “A huge part of what we need to do now is to manage the fear”, explains Dr Maha, “so that others who present with Covid-19 symptoms do not go into hiding. We need them to know that if their results are positive, they are in good hands”. The fear is acute, especially among health workers. Melke says there was a recent suspected case of coronavirus at Nonga Hospital and the patient was transferred multiple times between hospital departments as medical staff fled, too scared to touch the patient. “Finally, one nurse put her hand up, declaring that she would sacrifice herself for the sake of the patient,” said Melke, who recalls the nurse said: “‘Larim mi suicide tasol, mi lukautim em, mi ken dai’ [Let me suicide, I will look out for them, I can die] and she alone nursed the patient.” The patient turned out to have pneumonia and was cleared of Covid-19. ‘There is no medicine’ If anything, the fears are even more acute in rural health clinics, where the resources for nursing staff are even fewer. A two-hour drive from Rabaul on a road strewn with potholes and corrugation, is the rural health clinic at Warangoi, where nurses report working to the point of exhaustion in desperately under-resourced conditions.     The emergency kits in the labour consist of two plastic boxes. Nurses from Warangoi clinic say they do not have enough instruments, PPE or sanitisers for their day to day needs. Photograph: Kalo Fainu/The Guardian    “We struggle with drug shortages, we have endless problems with our facilities and our wards,” says Rosemary Darius, the head nurse at the clinic. “We don’t have proper equipment to treat patients with, our bedding is not in good condition, we don’t have proper instruments or disinfectants to sanitise our instruments - if coronavirus comes here, we will be disabled. We have nothing to disinfect with.”    Sometimes there’s no gloves, so we put our hands in the plastic bags of rice... Even to wash the floor, we don’t have strong detergents, just laundry powder.  Margaret Melke, nurse     Melke used to work at Warangoi clinic. “I ran away because of the problems here. Even for a mother [who] comes to deliver, there is no gauze, there is no IV fluid, there is no medicine to control the bleeding. We use their nappies. We tell them to give us five of their nappies so we can use them to soak up the blood. “I am lucky because my husband works at Nonga Hospital, so I would ask him to smuggle some gauze so when I was on duty I could use it. We tell patients to bring their own lap-lap (sarong) so we can soak up the blood. Sometimes there’s no gloves, so we put our hands in the plastic bags of rice just to protect ourselves. Even to wash the floor, we don’t have strong detergents, just Omo (laundry powder). There’s often not enough sanitiser for the nurses even to wash their own hands.”     Worn and broken gurneys sit outside one of the wards at the Warangoi health clinic in East New Britain, PNG. Photograph: Kalo Fainu/The Guardian    We get our news about the virus from social media It is not surprising that in light of these conditions, healthcare workers like those at Warangoi are apprehensive at the news of a positive Covid-19 case in their district. All the nurses the Guardian spoke to said their families have asked them to stop working as they are scared they will bring the virus back to their villages, or that they might even be chased away. “We are scared because we are the frontliners receiving the patients. PPE is a big need. We don’t have enough resources, and manpower is one of our biggest concerns,” said Anne Tatau, a nurse at Warangoi health clinic. Staff say they lack information and training to help them manage a potentially catastrophic outbreak. Nurses told the Guardian that only higher-level administrative staff have received training since the Covid-19 state of emergency was declared and Tatau says frontline staff “rely on social media, news updates and personal research to inform themselves” about the virus.     Nurses from Warangoi clinic say they do not have enough instruments, PPE or sanitisers for their day to day needs. Photograph: Kalo Fainu/The Guardian    Maha, the deputy chief physician at Nonga General Hospital, disputes these claims, saying health workers across the region have been given the opportunity to undertake training by an infection control nurse, but that: “No one turns up.” Health minister Jelta Wong said on Wednesday that swift and aggressive measures had been put in place to stop the spread of infection in East New Britain, his home province, including rapid response teams composed of epidemiologists, doctors, nurses, and infection prevention and control specialists. Contract tracing has begun and the affected woman’s village is under lockdown, with police officers stationed around it. Although Maha believes he has the right team, and enough PPE and medical supplies to handle an outbreak in East New Britain, he admits that at times the health system does face some challenges. “We have been improvising for 20 years, but we’ve always managed,” he said."
119,health,How deprivation in the north has led to a health crisis,"Like many areas of the north of England, residents of the Greater Manchester constituency of Heywood and Middleton – one of the so-called “red wall” seats that turned Tory for the first time at the general election – suffer poorer than average health. According to data from the House of Commons library, rates of some of the most common health conditions are higher in Heywood and Middleton than the rest of the country. Some 15.5% of the local population have been diagnosed with depression compared with an England average of 9.8%; 11.8% of adults are obese (England: 9.7%); 7.7% have diabetes (England: 6.7%); 14.7% have high blood pressure (England: 13.8%) and 2.8% have one of the progressive lung diseases known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (England: 1.9%). Painter and decorator Alexander Muresan has a lung condition and COPD. The 46-year-old lives in Middleton, a town in the south of the constituency, and needs regular medical attention. “I think people here always think they are overlooked in comparison to the south. People think London comes first and we get the trickle after. At most doctors you feel like they want you in and out the door.” More than a quarter of adults (26.5%) in Rochdale, the local authority area, are classed as “physically inactive”, compared with the England average of 22.2%. Poor public transport means most people drive rather than use public transport: most of the constituency is nowhere near a tram or train stop and buses are slow and expensive. Middleton lost its railway station in the 1960s and despite being just six miles from central Manchester now feels a bit isolated. Deprivation plays a big role in ill-health: 21% of Heywood and Middleton is classed as “highly deprived”, compared with 0% of Boris Johnson’s constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip. At Middleton’s shopping centre, the Lighthouse Project community hub operates a busy food bank as well as the Pantry club, where members pay £3.50 a week for ten food items worth around £15, plus a selection of fresh fruit and veg. Margaret White, 65, volunteers there and says many in the area have fallen on hard times. “This used to be a prosperous place with lots of manufacturing and now lots of those jobs have now gone. People now, if they want a good job, have to go into Manchester. This has led to more unemployment. Poor transport as well, a lot of people can’t get to the jobs, we have poor transport links, particularly the bus services are bad, which makes people deprived,” she says. Life expectancy in the north has increased far slower than in the south. Between 1991 and 1993, men in Rochdale were expected to live on average to 71.4 – not too dissimilar from in Kensington and Chelsea in London, where male life expectancy then was 73. Now, the average man in the London borough will now live to 83.3 while his Rochdale counterpart will die at 77.2. Muresan was surprised to hear the statistics. “You’d think it’d be the opposite, with more pollution in London you’d think they’d have the lower life expectancy. I’ve been to London a few times and everyone is always running and no one looks like they have a minute to spare and up here, up north, is a bit more laid back,” he says. Aisha Connor, 48, a care assistant, says she thinks healthcare needs better funding locally. “A lot of our patients don’t get the drugs they need because they cost too much money so they just leave them. It’s disgusting,” she says. “I don’t think people in Middleton care much about their health … until there’s something wrong with them.”"
120,health,"Rupert Murdoch, Fox News’ Covid-19 misinformation is a danger to public health","Americans consistently rate the Fox News Channel as one of the most trusted TV channels. The average age of Fox News viewers is 65. It is well established that this population incurs the greatest risk from the Covid-19 pandemic. In other words, Fox News viewers are at special risk from the coronavirus. But viewers of Fox News, including the president of the United States, have been regularly subjected to misinformation relayed by the network – false statements downplaying the prevalence of Covid-19 and its harms; misleading recommendations of activities that people should undertake to protect themselves and others, including casual recommendations of untested drugs; false assessments of the value of measures urged upon the public by their elected political leadership and public health authorities.   Related: The newspaper industry was already faltering. Will coronavirus obliterate it?    The misinformation that reaches the Fox News audience is a danger to public health. Indeed, it is not an overstatement to say that your misreporting endangers your own viewers – and not only them, for in a pandemic, individual behavior affects significant numbers of other people as well. Yet by commission as well as omission – direct, uncontested misinformation as well as failure to report the true dimensions of the crisis – Fox News has been derelict in its duty to provide clear and accurate information about Covid-19. As the virus spread across the world, Fox News hosts and guests minimized the dangers, accusing Democrats and the media of inflating the dangers (in Sean Hannity’s words) to “bludgeon Trump with this new hoax”. Such commentary encouraged Donald Trump to trivialize the threat and helped obstruct national, state and local efforts to limit the coronavirus. The network’s delinquency was effective. According to a YouGov/Economist poll conducted 15-17 March, Americans who pay the most attention to Fox News are much less likely than others to say they are worried about the coronavirus. A Pew Research poll found that 79% of Fox News viewers surveyed believed the media had exaggerated the risks of the virus. Sixty-three per cent of Fox viewers said they believed the virus posed a minor threat to the health of the country. As recently as Sunday, 22 March, the Fox News host Steve Hilton deplored accurate views of the pandemic, which he attributed to “our ruling class and their TV mouthpieces – whipping up fear over this virus”.    Misinformation furthers the reach and the dangers of the pandemic    Fox News reporters have done some solid reporting. And the network has recently given some screen time to medical and public health professionals. But Fox News does not clearly distinguish between the authority that should accrue to trained experts, on the one hand, and the authority viewers grant to pundits and politicians for reasons of ideological loyalty. There is a tendency to accept (or reject) them all indiscriminately, for after all, they are talking heads who appear on Fox News, a trusted source of news. When the statements of knowledgeable experts are surrounded by false claims made by pundits and politicians, including the president – claims that are not rebutted by knowledgeable people in real time – the overall effect is to mislead a vulnerable public about risks and harms. Misinformation furthers the reach and the dangers of the pandemic. For example, the day after Tucker Carlson touted a flimsy French study on the use of two drugs to treat Covid-19, Trump touted “very, very encouraging early results” from those drugs, and promoted a third as a possible “game-changer”. The basic purpose of news organizations is to discover and tell the truth. This is especially necessary, and obvious, amid a public health crisis. Television bears a particular responsibility because even more millions than usual look there for reliable information. Inexcusably, Fox News has violated elementary canons of journalism. In so doing, it has contributed to the spread of a grave pandemic. Urgently, therefore, in the name of both good journalism and public health, we call upon you to help protect the lives of all Americans – including your elderly viewers – by ensuring that the information you deliver is based on scientific facts.  This open letter to Fox Corporation’s chairman, Rupert Murdoch, and Fox Corporation’s CEO, Lachlan Murdoch, was signed by dozens of journalists and teachers of journalism across the US; you can view the complete list of signatories here "
121,health,"Tests, masks, beds: health workers grapple with shortages as coronavirus crisis grows","In San Francisco, hospital workers have erected plastic “surge tents” to add extra isolation space for incoming patients. In Chicago, Rush University hospital readied 40 negative-pressure rooms that keep infectious agents from leaking out, and prepared to convert an entire wing into a containment area in just two hours. And on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, doctors have postponed all non-essential surgeries to free up ventilators and bed space. 
Hospitals across the US are readying for a surge in critically ill patients as the coronavirus continues to spread. But many fear that even the drastic measures now being taken may not be enough. Doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers who spoke with the Guardian have described shortages of crucial testing supplies and protective equipment, while others expressed concerns about inadequate training or understaffed facilities.

“What we’re all fearing is that in the next few days we’re going to see a huge uptick of very sick patients,” said Dr Jeanne Noble, who is managing the Covid-19 response for a University of California San Francisco hospital. Yet Noble says that at the hospital, one of the largest in the city, they are already close to running out of essential supplies such as the nasal swabs needed for tests, or the masks essential to protecting their workers. “That’s what’s keeping me up at night,” she says. 
Noble says the fact that the federal government did not allow local medical facilities to do their own testing for the virus for nearly two months “crippled” her hospital’s ability to quickly triage patients, forcing it to “burn through” much of its stock of masks and protective equipment for doctors. She says that because of the test shortage, hospital staff have been forced to treat all respiratory patients as if they are infected. As a result, in one 24-hour period, they went through a three-month supply of N-95 masks. 
“To try to keep our health workers from being quarantined [as a result of inadvertent exposure to coronavirus patients] we have to overuse our protective supplies,” she explains.

Coronavirus has already sickened hundreds in California and killed at least 11. But those numbers could rise dramatically, says Dr George Rutherford, a UCSF epidemiologist and infectious disease specialist, putting immense pressure on hospitals. Rutherford says it is reasonable to assume California alone could have a million cases, which could add 10,000 critically ill patients to the demand on the state’s already-crowded ICU beds, which number just 11,000. 
“Worst-case scenario is we won’t have enough beds for people who need them,” he says, adding that he is especially concerned about the numbers of ventilators available, since Covid-19 affects the lungs and many critically ill patients are expected to need breathing support. But he is hopeful that the strong steps California counties are taking to keep people at home could help spread out the demand so it doesn’t all hit at once.

After a “sobering” meeting with state hospital officials, the California governor, Gavin Newsom, said on Tuesday that the state had pledged $1bn for healthcare support measures, including leasing two hospitals that are currently not in use and acquiring hundreds of hotel rooms, mobile homes and trailers. He put the state’s national guard units on alert for humanitarian assistance and called on the federal government to provide mobile hospitals, including navy hospital ships floating off the coast of California, to treat patients. 
In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo said the peak of the infections might not even hit for another 45 days and could overwhelm the state’s healthcare system. He said the state would need additional hospital beds to cope with the crisis and reiterated his call for federal assistance. 
The current trajectory of the pandemic’s spread “is at a point that is unsustainable for our healthcare system”, he said. 
Nasal swabs and face masks running low 
Beyond a shortage of beds and ventilators for patients, healthcare workers expressed fears about the lack of protective gear available to keep themselves and others safe. 
In Alabama, a pediatrician said the supply of protective masks in her office had run so low that she was forced to wash and reuse the same mask every day during her appointments with children, many of whom have coughs, fevers and runny noses. 
The kids will probably be fine even if they have the coronavirus, she said, as children have so far rarely been severely affected by coronavirus. But she fears all it will take is one coughing kid to put her out of commission. 
“I feel like I’m being wasted,” said the pediatrician, who asked not to be named to protect her job. “I’ve trained for this sort of situation all my life. I work so hard with these patients. But I don’t feel like [those running the healthcare establishment] care about us. They don’t care about protecting us.”

The vice-president, Mike Pence, announced on Monday that the federal government planned to boost the supply of masks by allowing health workers to use construction-grade N-95 respirators, which are typically manufactured for building sites, not hospitals. Yet one of the main manufacturers of the masks, 3M, says it still doesn’t expect to be able to keep up with the demand. 
“Even as we are increasing production, we still anticipate demand for respirators and other supplies needed for Covid-19 response to outpace supply for the foreseeable future,” said a 3M spokesperson in a statement on Tuesday. 
Other crucial medical equipment is also in short supply. While a larger number of coronavirus test kits have become available in recent days, some of the standard laboratory ingredients, including chemicals called “reagents” that are needed to run the tests, are becoming scarce nationally. 
“We are deeply concerned that as the number of tests increases dramatically over the coming weeks, clinical labs will be unable to deploy them without these critical components,” the American Society for Microbiology said in a statement last week. “Increased demand for testing has the potential to exhaust supplies needed to perform the testing itself.” 
The long nasal swabs needed to conduct the tests are also running short, according to hospitals. “We are currently experiencing shortages of testing swabs,” said Dr Noble of UCSF, but she added that it had “not yet impacted our ability to perform tests”. 
Newsom said he had spoken with Donald Trump on Tuesday and called on the president to repurpose the nation’s manufacturing sector to make things like swabs, which he said were desperately needed. 
“We have a deep need for personnel and supplies: masks – even basic masks – and gloves,” Newsom said, adding that chemicals to run tests were running short. “Testing kits are like printers that you purchase, but you need to buy the ink for them. We have the tests, but right now we don’t have the supplies to use them.”

‘The pool of competent physicians has significantly declined’ 
Others worry about having enough adequately trained medical professionals. 
Dr Hayato Mori, an orthopedic surgeon in Oahu, said hospitals in Hawaii have had to implement severe cost-cutting measures to remain profitable. They have cut staff and moved to using specialized doctors called “hospitalists” to manage unstable patients, so many doctors are no longer well versed in emergency treatment. It is a pattern that has been repeated in hospitals across the US, he says. 
“The pool of competent physicians to help manage the influx of hundreds of severely ill patients in respiratory distress have significantly declined in our community,” said Mori.

In San Francisco, Sasha Cuttler, a department of public health nurse, is relieved to have been fitted weeks in advance for a mask that fits very securely to block out infectious agents. Cuttler has also been given extra training to join a team of six nurses that is visiting homes to test patients the department has identified as potentially having been exposed to coronavirus, but worries that many more people need to be trained and that equipment may soon run short. 
“I hope it’s not too little too late,” said Cuttler, who has worked with tuberculosis patients in the past. “It takes a long time to train people.” 
Despite the daily challenges, Cuttler is working to make the testing less scary for patients. For instance, while recently visiting families at home whose young children needed testing to rule out a possible coronavirus outbreak at school, Cuttler came up with fun ways to make the ordeal a little less grim. 
After calling to alert families, “I pretended it was Halloween,” said Cuttler, who showed up covered head-to-toe with a blue mask, a face shield, a plastic yellow protective gown, booties and purple gloves. Cuttler has adopted the moniker Corona Queen 19 and even made up a “flatten the curve” dance move to perform for children, reaching out widely while doing a hip thrust. 
“I have learned how to win the trust of the public with my dance,” Cuttler said. “I’m happy to report the children I tested have all tested negative.”"
122,health,Coronavirus: what other public health emergencies has the WHO declared?,"The Wuhan coronavirus is just the latest disease that the World Health Organization (WHO) has labelled as a “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC). In the past 10 years there have been five other such announcements, covering four diseases. However, the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) coronavirus, first identified in 2012, and the yellow fever outbreak in Angola that emerged in late 2015 are not among them, despite emergency committees convening. While some emergencies are now over, others such as the poliovirus, are still active. 2019: Ebola It took four meetings of the WHO emergency committee for the Ebola outbreak, which began in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018, to be declared a PHEIC.  “The committee cited recent developments in the outbreak in making its recommendation, including the first confirmed case in Goma, a city of almost 2 million people on the border with Rwanda, and the gateway to the rest of DRC and the world,” the WHO noted. 2016: Zika virus In February 2016 the WHO declared the mosquito-borne Zika virus a PHEIC – a declaration largely driven by concern over links between the disease and certain neurological conditions including microcephaly. It is a congenital condition in which babies are born with unusually small heads.  2014: Ebola The declaration in August 2014 related to Ebola in west Africa, and came with a plea for the international community to help countries affected by the disease. “Countries affected to date simply do not have the capacity to manage an outbreak of this size and complexity on their own,” said Margaret Chan, the WHO’s director general, at the time. “I urge the international community to provide this support on the most urgent basis possible.” However, the response of the UN body to the disaster has been criticised in a number of reports. “This PHEIC occurred five months after the WHO first received information about the Ebola threat, by which point there had already been 1,711 cases and 932 deaths. Such delay undoubtedly contributed to the unprecedented scale of the outbreak,” wrote Clare Wenham, a London School of Economics Fellow in Global Health Politics, in an analysis of the WHO response. 2014: Poliovirus In May 2014 the international spread of polio was deemed a PHEIC by the WHO. “If unchecked, this situation could result in failure to eradicate globally one of the world’s most serious vaccine-preventable diseases,” the WHO statement read. The situation is ongoing. In October 2019, the WHO reported: “The committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a public health emergency of international concern.” 2009: Swine flu Swine flu, or more precisely, swine influenza A(H1N1), was the first PHEIC to be declared by the WHO. The designation had been created with the establishment of new international health regulations that came into force in 2007. These were created following the Sars outbreak that began in 2002, infecting more than 8,000 people and claiming about 800 lives."
123,health,Health inequalities are widening and society is fractured. Here’s a solution,"England has lost a decade,” Sir Michael Marmot said this week as he presented his 10-year review of his seminal 2010 analysis of health inequalities. “I have evidence to support that assertion,” he added. And he surely did. From stalled life expectancy – worsening for the poorest women – to growing numbers of children living in poverty, the University College London professor and unrivalled expert in inequalities research fired off a battery of data showing how England has grown more polarised by health in a decade. It was “highly likely” that austerity policies were the principal cause, he concluded, while in the rest of the UK “the damage to health and wellbeing is similarly unprecedented”.   Related: Austerity blamed for life expectancy stalling for first time in century    Less high profile, but equally concerning, was an report last week by the Office for National Statistics suggesting we are becoming a more fractured society: we have less “positive engagement” with neighbours, swapping favours or stopping to chat, and admit we are losing our sense of belonging to a neighbourhood; we are doing less to help elderly or disabled people in the community and even to help our own parents or adult children; and we are joining fewer clubs and societies, instead networking online from the isolation of our living rooms. Across 25 measures of “social capital”, many key indicators are alarmingly down. What can be done to reverse these widening health inequalities and the seeming loss of our (non-digital) social glue? How about, for starters, establishing a national centre where activists from some of the poorest communities could go to gain the confidence and skills to help their neighbours fight against social, financial and environmental social exclusion? As it happens, just such a centre was opened in 1995. More than 40,000 people have since attended Trafford Hall, near Chester, and benefited from its residential courses, taking back to their housing estates the wherewithal to challenge authority and – in the jargon – empower their friends and neighbours. But 12 months ago the centre suddenly closed, a victim of cashflow problems brought on by austerity cuts to the budgets of housing agencies and charities that funded the training. The 25 staff, who also hosted weddings and other revenue-earning events at the listed 18th-century former country house, were made redundant. Trafford Hall is an emblem of the story of public services over the past 30 years: conceived in the late 1980s in the social policy hothouse of the London School of Economics, and made real largely by the drive and determination of Anne Power, head of the LSE Housing and Communities research group, it thrived under the Blair and Brown Labour governments but benefited also from charitable and corporate support. Architect Richard Rogers was a committed supporter from the off, Prince Charles opened important doors and performed the opening ceremony, while Grand Metropolitan (now Diageo) bought the house and builders John Laing converted it at cost price.   Related: The secret to happiness? Health, housing and job security | Julian Baggini    Poignantly, one of the last housing sector events held at Trafford Hall before its closure was organised to reflect on lessons of the 2017 Grenfell fire and to feed into the public inquiry into the tragedy. One of its conclusions was: “Tenants are entitled to have a voice in the safety, maintenance and general condition of their blocks. They often know more than staff about who lives in blocks, and about earlier works, as they have often been around longer than housing staff.” Hearing the voice of the UK’s 9 million social tenants will be a central and lasting message from the inquiry. And in Trafford Hall, ministers have a singular and symbolic opportunity to demonstrate that they intend not just to listen, but to help articulate and amplify that voice while at the same time building social capital and tackling inequalities. The National Communities Resource Centre, the charity behind Trafford Hall, hopes to reopen it this spring. It is still fundraising, and reckons to be about £70,000 short of what is needed in the first instance, but the government could ease the process immeasurably by pledging support. In the early 1990s, a Tory administration chipped in to help meet set-up costs at Trafford Hall. Today, its successors should do no less. • David Brindle is the Guardian’s public services editor • This article was amended on 27 February 2020 to correct the number of people who have used Trafford Hall since 1995 from 4,000 to 40,000."
124,health,NHS staff to be offered mental health support for Covid-19 'shell shock',"All of the NHS’s 1.4 million staff will be offered free mental health support from Friday to help them cope with the “shell shock” of tackling Covid-19. 
NHS staff will be given free access to a programme of more than 1,500 specialists, online therapy and group counselling sessions. They will also receive practical and financial assistance as well as specialist bereavement, psychological support and help with sleep problems. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
“I don’t want to use war language, but when the crisis hits, we are likely to see NHS staff suffering symptoms similar to shell shock,” said Lucy Warner, chief executive of NHS Practitioner Health, which has set up the mental health side of the wellbeing programme. 
Warner said this was a long-term programme. “Staff might not need this most badly in the immediate term, when the crisis hits because they’ll be so busy. But three to six months down the line … staff are likely to suffer symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome.” 
Prerana Issar, chief people officer for the NHS, said: “We need to do everything we can to support our incredible NHS people as they care for people through this global health emergency. That’s why we have developed a range of support for all NHS staff, from one-to-one mental health support to a sympathetic voice to confide in.” 
Volunteers staffing the phone and text lines have come from charities including Hospice UK, the Samaritans and Shout. 
The NHS has also partnered with Headspace, UnMind and Big Health to offer free access to their apps which offer support in issues ranging from guided meditation to tools to battle anxiety and help with sleep problems. 
Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, said: “As the pandemic continues, our people will face new and growing challenges on a daily basis and it’s therefore more important than ever that they are able to access resources to help them manage their wellbeing, in a way that suits their needs.” 
Ruth Chaloner, founder of the HelpHub, an online therapy service offering free sessions across the UK, will provide specialist supervisors to support the new service’s front-line therapists.

“Supervision for these therapists will be crucial,” she said. “They will be listening to NHS staff who are scared, anxious and fearful, repeatedly telling them the same type of story: how they had to set up Facetime so a husband could say goodbye to his wife, for example, or how someone just died on them, and they don’t know why. 
“These therapists will be listening to the same or similar stories multiple times every day,” she said. “Many therapists aren’t accustomed to helping people through this level of raw trauma but we can see the sheer mass of grief and trauma coming down the line at us for probably years to come.” 
The president of the British Psychological Society, David Murphy, said: “The coronavirus crisis has placed unprecedented demands on staff working in health and social care. 
“Not only are they facing long hours, intense work and a risk of infection, but they are also managing psychological distress of patients, offering care at the end of life, and supporting bereaved families. This is true for both clinical staff and non-clinical staff working at the frontline.”"
125,health,Surely the link between abusing animals and the world's health is now clear,"The boast that “when the facts change, I change my mind” is a proud one. “When the facts change, I reinforce my prejudices” is truer. If you want proof, look at the coronavirus that has changed everything and consider the undisputed fact that it spread because of humanity’s abuse of animals. Imagine a world where facts changed minds. The United Nations, governments and everyone with influence would now be saying we should abandon meat or at a minimum cut down on consumption. Perhaps my reading is not as wide as it should be, but I have heard nothing of the sort argued. Making the case would be child’s play and would not be confined to emphasising that Covid-19 probably jumped species in Wuhan’s grotesque wet markets. The Sars epidemic of 2002-04 began in Guangdong, probably in bats, and then spread to civet cats, sold in markets and eaten in restaurants. The H7N9 strain of bird flu began in China, once again, and moved to humans from diseased poultry. China is a viral petri dish because the Communist party silences voices that warn of danger, as the heroic doctor Li Wenliang found. Centuries of imperial and socialist dictatorship have taught people to respect the adage “The shot hits the bird that pokes its head out”. Repression combines with folk beliefs in the medicinal power of animal carcasses, a deadly quackery that the world’s fastest growing middle class has the money to indulge. Bats, which may be the original source of coronavirus as well as Sars, are meant to restore eyesight. The palm civet is devoured as a sham cure for insomnia.     A health worker administers Ebola vaccine to a woman in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Photograph: Olivia Acland/Reuters    Yet it is too comfortable to damn the Chinese Communist party, essential though that task is. Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) originated in the Middle East, as its name suggests, and came to humans via camels. Ebola began in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and was probably caught from gorillas and chimpanzees. Diseases have always jumped species, but the Covid-19 pandemic may be a sign of an ominous acceleration. A paper this month in the Proceedings of the Royal Society suggests the rate of new infections could be rising as humans cram into every corner of the planet. The loss of habitat and the exploitation of wildlife through hunting and trade increased the risk of infectious “spillover”, it said. Ferocious punishments for the use of “exotic” animals for food and medicines are required. Once again, though, that is too easy a slogan for people in the west to chant and feel virtuous as they chant it. We should be examining our own diets. If antibiotic resistance continues to grow, we may look back on the deaths of the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, and say: “Really? Was that all?” Resistance could end the age of medical progress, returning humanity to a time when minor injuries and routine operations could be fatal. The over-prescription of antibiotics to humans explains in part why bacteria are evolving to resist it, and why researchers are predicting 10 million deaths a year from antibiotic resistance by 2050. Antibiotic use in the intensive and unfathomably cruel production of meat is as pernicious. Factory farming strains animal health. Breeding sows that are not given enough time to recover before being impregnated again, and chickens in crowded cages suffering from heat stress that brings salmonella and E coli, need repeated doses. In 2012, when the then chief medical officer, Sally Davies, warned that antibiotics were losing their “effectiveness at a rate that is both alarming and irreversible”, she compared the looming health crisis to global warming. To make her comparison complete, we can add that meat eating does indeed contribute disproportionately to the production of greenhouse gasses. Ban the use of antibiotics in farming, then. Treat meat, cow milk and cheese as we treat tobacco and alcohol and hit them with punitive taxes. Make the illegal trade in wild animals as great a crime as the illegal trade in weapons.    Rather than change minds, the corona crisis is cementing them    However rational such stirring declarations may be, I feel I am no longer connected to myself or the world around me when I issue them. I am not a vegan. If changing facts changed minds, I should become one – as should you, in all likelihood. Even if individuals change, the dominant culture makes demands for society to change appear ridiculously utopian. Imagine a politician campaigning for stiff restrictions on meat consumption. Critics would accuse him or her of punishing the poor – for people who barely think of the poor always invoke them when their pleasures are threatened. They would be damned for wanting to ban the good old Sunday lunch and the joy a Big Mac brings. Our grandchildren may look back and find our abuse of animals incomprehensible. For the moment, arguments to stop abuse provoke incomprehension. Rather than change minds, the corona crisis is cementing them. No one knows its political and cultural consequences, only that there will be consequences. Ignorance has not stopped Jeremy Corbyn saying the pandemic proved his socialism was “absolutely right” and Nigel Farage saying that, on the contrary, it showed he was right about free movement being doomed. Trump blames China. China blames America. In other words, they are all saying and doing what they would have said and done if the virus had never jumped the species barrier and no one outside China had heard of Wuhan’s wet markets. Today’s suffering dominates our thoughts, but beneath it two explanations of human behaviour are competing. Optimists believe that governments and peoples will adapt to new circumstances and recognise new realities. We will soon learn if they are right. The great physicist Max Planck put the pessimistic case in 1950. A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents, he said. Rather, “its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it”. Planck’s admirers condensed his argument into a phrase that is a little too resonant today: “Science advances one funeral at a time.” • Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist"
126,health,‘Timing is critical’: Native Americans warn virus may overwhelm underfunded health services,"Native American health leaders are urging the US government to distribute urgently needed equipment and funding to help contain the spread of coronavirus among tribal members, amid mounting concerns that the pandemic could overwhelm chronically underresourced tribal health services. Tribes are reporting shortages of essential protective gear and testing services, as well as medical manpower and emergency planning expertise which were already severely lacking in many communities due to insufficient federal investment. There are 574 federally recognized sovereign tribal nations located across almost 40 states within the geographic borders of the United States. Native communities are disproportionately affected by health conditions that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has specifically identified increase the risk of serious complications from Covid-19. On Tuesday, the Navajo Nation, the largest territorial tribe with 350,000 members, shut down its casinos and resorts as part of broad emergency measures after a 46-year-old tribe member was diagnosed with the virus in Arizona. By Friday, 14 cases had been confirmed.  So far, only a handful of Covid-19 cases have been confirmed on tribal lands, but limited access to testing and real-time surveillance means the true number is likely to be much higher – and expected to increase rapidly in coming days. In Washington, amid pressure from a handful of lawmakers to include Native Americans in the coronavirus aid package, $40m was designated for tribal health and Urban Indian Health Organizations (UIHO) as part of last week’s emergency federal relief legislation. The money, which is far lower than  health leaders had requested, is to beef up surveillance, infection control and mitigation measures to confront the rapidly evolving Covid-19 crisis. But while the states received the emergency funds immediately, the tribes are yet to receive a cent as it must go through the CDC. “It’s not enough … a lot more funding is going to be needed across Indian country … we need resources, and supplies as quickly as possible, distributed directly to the tribes,” said Dr Thomas Kim, medical director of the California Rural Indian Health Board (CRIHB). “During the H1N1 crisis, it was awkward, delayed and cumbersome to access supplies from the national stockpile. We hope this doesn’t happen again, because timing is critical,” added Kim.    A lot more funding is going to be needed. We need resources, and supplies as quickly as possible, distributed directly to the tribes  Dr Thomas Kim     Tribal health organizations are not guaranteed access to drugs and medical supplies in the federal national stockpile. “Lives are at stake,” said Francys Crevier, executive director of the National Council of Urban Indian Health (NCUIH). “We are gravely concerned about the timeline for funds and resources to Indian country … organizations are already seeing significant impacts to their already chronically underfunded budgets.” At least 70% of American Indian and Alaska Natives reside in urban or suburban areas. One program in Seattle, Washington – the state with the second-highest number of confirmed cases – estimates monthly costs to rise by three-quarters of a million dollars during the pandemic. Despite the Trump administration dismantling federal pandemic units, important steps have been made to improve community resilience in recent years. In the wake of 9/11, the CDC created the public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) program to help states plan and prepare for unpredictable crises such as terrorist attacks and disease outbreaks. The program has been a roaring success, according to the CDC website, with almost 100% of states ready to mobilize staff during an emergency, operate an incident command system, and have sufficient storage and distribution capacity for critical medical supplies. But tribal nations have been excluded from PHEP program funds – despite pleas from the CDC’s own senior tribal representatives. “Many tribes won’t have adequate, well-rehearsed emergency plans because the CDC repeatedly refused to include them in PHEP,” said Dean Seneca, a former senior health scientist in the CDC’s office for state, tribal, local and territorial support. “It was an ongoing battle, we fought tooth and nail to make tribes directly eligible for this support but the CDC always said no … too many tribes aren’t ready for this [pandemic].” Last week, congresswoman Deb Haaland, vice-chair of the House committee on natural resources, co-sponsored legislation to overturn this inequality, which some fear could prove catastrophic for smaller tribes during the pandemic. “The CDC is not working well with the tribes at all … we have to fix this. This is a national crisis and coronavirus is not going to discriminate against anyone and it’s vital every nation has the help it needs to weather this storm,” Haaland told the Guardian.     Congresswoman Deb Haaland lobbied for money to be designated to tribes in the multibillion-dollar coronavirus aid package. Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/Associated Press    Haaland, the first Native woman to be elected to Congress, also lobbied for designated money for tribes in the multibillion-dollar aid package: “The $40m is an emergency supplement which the tribes needed yesterday … of course it’s not enough because the Indian Health Service (IHS) has been underfunded for decades, but we are determined to make sure tribes are specifically included in every federal package so people get the help they need.” Covid-19 is exposing gaping political and healthcare chasms in countries across the globe. The deep-seated deficiencies in tribal health services in the US – and inequalities in Native health outcomes – were already stark. The US government is required to ensure adequate healthcare, education, housing, economic development and agricultural assistance for tribal nations, as part of its treaty obligations. But it has never adequately funded these treaty provisions, according to the National Congress of American Indians. In 2016, the government spent $8,602 per capita on healthcare for federal inmates compared with $2,843 per patient within the IHS. A quarter of medical positions within the IHS – including doctors, dentists and nurses – are vacant, according to an investigation by the New York Times. In some areas, the vacancy rate is as high as 50%. The mortality rates for chronic preventable diseases such as diabetes and lower respiratory conditions like asthma, emphysema and bronchitis are three to five times higher for Indians using tribal IHS hospitals than the rest of the US population. The data from Asia and Europe clearly shows the elderly and those with these sort of pre-existing medical conditions are most likely to suffer serious complications – including death – from Covid-19. The elderly play a unique role in tribal communities, according to Vanesscia Cresci, research and public health director at CRIHB. “Our elders are the keepers of culture and tradition, and often the last speaker of native languages, to lose them could mean losing a language, we have to keep them safe.” In South Dakota, a housing officer in the Yankton Sioux tribe tested positive last week after traveling to Las Vegas with four other tribal members. He came into close contact with at least 14 colleagues and numerous community members before seeking medical help. His travel companions tested negative; others he had contact with were advised to self-quarantine, but weren’t tested. “We don’t have a medical emergency plan … we’re taking precautionary measures on the fly,” said council member Derrick Marks. The tribe declared a state of emergency, and shutdown schools, tribal offices and social gatherings for the elderly. The precarious situation has community elder Joan Jones, 58, a diabetic whose furnace the housing officer fixed a day before being diagnosed, scared. As well as caring for her diabetic husband, children and grandchildren, Jones works in a nursing home and helps coordinate a free meal service for the community’s poorest families still reeling from last year’s devastating floods. “I’m staying home. I don’t want to infect anyone else, especially my family, we’re all worried.”"
127,health,America has no real public health system – coronavirus has a clear run,"Dr Anthony S Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and just about the only official in the Trump administration trusted to tell the truth about the coronavirus, said last Thursday: “The system does not, is not really geared to what we need right now … It is a failing, let’s admit it.”   Related: Why Washington state is at the center of the US coronavirus outbreak    While we’re at it, let’s admit something more basic. The system would be failing even under a halfway competent president. The dirty little secret, which will soon become apparent to all, is that there is no real public health system in the United States. The ad hoc response fashioned late Friday by House Democrats and the White House may help a bit, although it’s skimpy, as I’ll explain. As the coronavirus outbreak in the US follows the same grim exponential growth path first displayed in Wuhan, China, before herculean measures were put in place to slow its spread there, America is waking up to the fact that it has almost no public capacity to deal with it.    n America, the word 'public' means a sum total of individual needs, not the common good    Instead of a public health system, we have a private for-profit system for individuals lucky enough to afford it and a rickety social insurance system for people fortunate enough to have a full-time job. At their best, both systems respond to the needs of individuals rather than the needs of the public as a whole. In America, the word “public” – as in public health, public education or public welfare – means a sum total of individual needs, not the common good. Contrast this with America’s financial system. The Federal Reserve concerns itself with the health of financial markets as a whole. Late last week the Fed made $1.5tn available to banks, at the slightest hint of difficulties making trades. No one batted an eye. When it comes to the health of the nation as a whole, money like this isn’t available. And there are no institutions analogous to the Fed with responsibility for overseeing and managing the public’s health – able to whip out a giant checkbook at a moment’s notice to prevent human, rather than financial, devastation. Even if a test for the Covid-19 virus had been developed and approved in time, no institutions are in place to administer it to tens of millions of Americans free of charge. Local and state health departments are already bare bones, having lost nearly a quarter of their workforce since 2008, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials. Healthcare in America is delivered mainly by private for-profit corporations which, unlike financial institutions, are not required to maintain reserve capacity. As a result, the nation’s supply of ventilators isn’t nearly large enough to care for projected numbers of critically ill coronavirus victims unable to breathe for themselves. Its 45,000 intensive care unit beds fall woefully short of the 2.9 million likely to be needed. The Fed can close banks to quarantine financial crises but the US can’t close workplaces because the nation’s social insurance system depends on people going to work. Almost 30% of American workers have no paid sick leave from their employers, including 70% of low-income workers earning less than $10.49 an hour. Vast numbers of self-employed workers cannot afford sick leave. Friday’s deal between House Democrats and the White House won’t have much effect because it exempts large employers and offers waivers to smaller ones.   Related: Will Trump's coronavirus travel ban work? Scientists express skepticism    Most jobless Americans don’t qualify for unemployment insurance because they haven’t worked long enough in a steady job and the ad-hoc deal doesn’t alter this. Meanwhile, more than 30 million Americans have no health insurance. Eligibility for Medicaid, food stamps and other public assistance is now linked to having or actively looking for work. It’s hard to close public schools because most working parents cannot afford childcare. Many poor children rely on school lunches for their only square meal a day. In Los Angeles, about 80% of students qualify for free or reduced lunches and just under 20,000 are homeless at some point during the school year. There is no public health system in the US, in short, because the richest nation in the world has no capacity to protect the public as a whole, apart from national defense. Ad-hoc remedies such as House Democrats and the White House fashioned on Friday are better than nothing, but they don’t come close to filling this void.  Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few and The Common Good. His next book, The System: Who Rigged It, How We Fix It, will be out in March. He is a columnist for Guardian US "
128,health,‘Dogs have a magic effect’: how pets can improve our mental health,"What is it about animals? As the bad news about the coronavirus continues, “send me dogs and cats” has become a regular cry on social media, an easy-to-grasp shorthand for “I feel terrible, cheer me up”. The response is always the same: a torrent of pictures of animals doing daft things – but somehow it has a magical, calming effect. The therapeutic value of our relationship with our pets, particularly dogs, is increasingly recognised by researchers. Cats can be wonderful too – but dogs have been domesticated by humans for much longer, and, as even the most devoted cat lover will admit, dogs are far easier to train for companionship. Most cats, as we know, are admirable for entirely different reasons. Marion Janner, a mental health campaigner and all-round animal lover, says that dogs teach us a whole range of lessons. “Dogs love us unconditionally. They’re the ultimate in equal opportunities – entirely indifferent to race, gender, star sign, CV, clothes size or ability to throw cool moves on the dance floor. The simplicity and depth of this love is a continuous joy, along with the health benefits of daily walks and the social delights of chats with other dog walkers. They teach kids to be responsible, altruistic and compassionate and, valuably but sadly, how to cope when someone you love dies.” Robert Doward* felt this odd effect when his health suddenly took a downward turn. “I’d been working incredibly hard, long hours, too many days. One day I started crying and just couldn’t stop. I couldn’t put sentences together properly. I’d been pushing everything so hard for so long, and I just couldn’t do it any more.” It took a long time to put himself back together: plus some therapy, another job and changes to his family life. But the key factor, he says only half-jokingly, was a small Greek rescue dog called Maria. “Taking her out for walks, getting out into fresh air, just putting one foot in front of the other, that lifts your spirits. And then there’s nothing like having a dog curled up beside you, even when you feel absolutely miserable. She’ll check my face anxiously, as if she knows something is wrong. And that makes me smile – and that somehow makes you feel better. There is just something magic about dogs. Honestly, she got me through.”     Patient Rayssa plays with Troia, a therapeutically trained dog, during a therapy session in Hospital Infantil Sabará in Sāo Paulo, Brazil.  Photograph: Nacho Doce/Reuters    But why? What is responsible for these therapeutic effects? One key aspect appears to be social recognition – the process of identifying another being as someone important and significant to you. The bond that forms between owner and pet is, it seems, similar to the bond that a mother forms with her baby. The importance of social recognition is increasingly acknowledged for the role it plays in helping us form networks. We now understand that healthy social bonds can play a key role in mental health; without them, we become lonely, depressed and physically unwell. And pets, it seems, can fulfil that role. Academic and psychologist June McNicholas points out that pets can be a lifeline for socially isolated people. “Pet care and self-care are linked. When you take a dog out for a walk, people talk to you and that may be the only social contact an isolated person has the whole day. If you have a cat, you can have a conversation standing in the cat food aisle in the supermarket, deciding which brand to buy. When pet owners leave the house to buy pet food, they’re more likely to buy food for themselves and when they feed their pet, they’ll sit down to eat too. People with disabilities often find that able-bodied people are socially awkward with them; if they have a dog it breaks down barriers and allows a more comfortable and natural interaction.”     A woman caresses a therapy dog in Markhot Ferenc hospital, Hungary. Photograph: Péter Komka/EPA-EFE    Social recognition is something humans share with a few (though not all) mammals, including sheep and prairie voles. We are primed to look after those we have made social bonds with; we don’t breastfeed just any old baby and we don’t take random dogs home from the park. Author and researcher Meg Daley Olmert explains “When we call our dog, ‘our baby’ it is because we recognise it on a neural level as such. And this recognition triggers the same maternal bonding brain networks that allow a mother to look at her red, slimy newborn and say, ‘mine!’” A small study of functional MRI brain scans in 18 women showed similar responses in regions involved in reward, emotion and affiliation when the women looked at images of their child and pet dog.There were important differences though; dogs caused activity in the fusiform gyrus (involved in facial recognition) and babies in the tegmentum (centres of reward and affiliation). We love our pets, but in a fire we’re primed to save the baby.     A child pets a utility dog at a facility for children affected by Down’s syndrome in Bucharest, Romania. Photograph: Vadim Ghirdă/AP    Although scientists have some understanding of social recognition and where it takes place in the brain, we still don’t entirely understand how it happens. The missing link could be oxytocin, the so-called “hug”, “love” or “cuddle” hormone. Oxytocin has a key role in both childbirth, lactation and sperm movement, but it also has an increasingly recognised role in our social behaviour, acting as a chemical messenger in pathways that control sexual arousal, recognition, trust, mother-infant and human-pet bonding. Oxytocin works in tandem with another brain hormone, vasopressin, to help to modulate our response to stress and deal with social situations. Unsurprisingly, there’s a lot of interest in a possible role for oxytocin in addiction, brain injury, anorexia, depression, autism and severe anxiety.   Related: Lessons in happiness: how a short course can boost your wellbeing    And there are other reasons that pets and therapy animals are increasingly recognised as being good for our mental health. In addition to helping to alleviate stress, anxiety, depression and loneliness, there are all the benefits that come from having to exercise a dog. Daily walks outdoors boost physical and emotional wellbeing. Chucking sticks, picking up balls – even scooping up dog poo – can provide an all-round workout. Increasingly that knowledge is being turned to practical use, with some lovely effects. When the Centre for Mental Health ran an evaluation on therapy dogs in prisons, for example, the feedback was off the scale. “I don’t know what it is, but even when I am running around with [the dog] I just feel better inside, calmer, more peaceful,” said one prisoner. Another told the interviewer: “Dogs have a magic effect on you, you can feel their love and that just makes you feel better inside you.” The good feelings persist even after the dogs have left, the reviewers found, with one subject saying: “I just walk around for the rest of the day on cloud nine.”     Retirement home residents in Aliso Viejo, California, play with therapy dogs brought by female volunteers. Photograph: Marmaduke St John/Alamy    Some of the UK’s most dangerous and violent mental health patients are cared for in one of four high-security psychiatric hospitals. Most are diagnosed with schizophrenia and stay an average of seven years. The State hospital in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, is one of these facilities and runs an  animal  therapy centre which gives patients the chance to pet and care for a range of animals including chipmunks, rabbits, hens, geese, pygmy goats and pigs. Staff say that animal therapy helps to develop problem-solving skills, empathy, attention to the needs of others, a sense of responsibility and a way of channelling aggressive thoughts among individuals who have proved hard to reach with conventional psychiatric drugs and talking therapies.  But what if you don’t have a pet? Is there any shortcut to reproducing the beneficial effects? One candidate is sildenafil (Viagra). Having sex causes an oxytocin surge in the brain and taking Viagra may reproduce that surge without the faff of mating. A more practical idea might be an oxytocin spray or tablet.  But biologist Sue Carter says that translating naturally occurring oxytocin into a commercially available product is challenging. Oxytocin has unique chemical properties and can shift form, making it hard to work with and measure. Importantly, “the effects of oxytocin are context dependent, sexually dimorphic (different in men and women), and altered by experience.” Honestly? Gazing into your dog’s eyes may produce a more reliable sense of wellbeing than any commercially available synthetic product. * Some names and details have been changed."

"
130,health,Boris Johnson is latest PM to face ill health during a national crisis,"Prime ministers do not aspire to infallibility or immortality, but a display of mental or physical frailty at a point of national crisis is something any Downing Street spin doctor would dearly wish to avoid, and if possible suppress. 
The impression of the ship of state adrift, and the helmsman heading below deck, pleading illness, hardly inspires confidence, however much personal sympathy in this case is felt towards Boris Johnson. With questions being asked about the government’s lockdown exit strategy and Labour revitalised by a new leader seeking to make a mark, No 10 needs to be at its most coherent and decisive. 
It is also a concern if Johnson as adjudicator is absent just as Whitehall jostling starts between those putting either the interests of the nation’s health or its economy first. 
But the infectiousness of this virus made it practically impossible for Johnson to hide from others in No 10, and the public, that he had contracted it. Once the decision was made for Johnson to go to hospital, No 10 went public within two hours. Little other option was available. Rumours had been circulating for days that his recovery was not under way, highlighted by the return of the health secretary, Matt Hancock. 
 
  
  
   
    What is Covid-19?
    
    Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.
    
    What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?
    
    According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment.
    About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.
    In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:
    
     a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back
     a new continuous cough - this means you’ve started coughing repeatedly
    
    As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.
    
    Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?
    
    Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.
    In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.
    
   
  
  
 
One person closely involved said: “The difficulty is that the crisis is so all-enveloping, the PM could not stop working. No one likes to think they are dispensable. The first step was to get him to admit to himself how ill he was becoming. What was subsequently admitted to the nation was a second order issue”. 
Even now No 10 is reluctant to go into detail on the prime minister’s health, stressing in its statement that the hospital admission was simply a precautionary step to undertake tests, rather than an acknowledgement that he had deteriorated. He would continue to be briefed at his hospital bed and was very much in charge. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
By contrast, Donald Trump in opening his Sunday press conference provided a dramatic, possibly melodramatic, medical bulletin on Johnson’s health, offering the US’s prayers to help Johnson in “his personal fight with the virus”. Trump has a relationship with the truth that could be described as sometimes adjacent, but he did not give the impression that Johnson was going to hospital for routine tests. 
If No 10 is being economical about a more serious illness, it would not be the first time the public has been misled by a serving prime minister about his health. The UK may be at war with an invisible virus, but British prime ministers at times of conflict have always been reluctant to admit they have been incapacitated. David Lloyd George in 1918 suffered a bout of influenza so severe his valet said it was touch and go whether he would survive. Medical bulletins at the time made no suggestion he was in any danger. 
Andrew Bonar Law resigned in 1923 only on receiving a diagnosis of terminal throat cancer, and Henry Campbell-Bannerman, prime minister from 1905 to 1908, died days after his resignation in 10 Downing Street. 
During Winston Churchill’s two wartime illnesses, the full extent of them was never revealed. In February 1943, after the then 69-year-old contracted pneumonia, his personal physician Charles Wilson drafted a bulletin, but Churchill immediately demanded to see it. He dismissed it as “alarmist” and liable to cause confusion and despondency and was, in any case, untrue. 
Churchill, therefore, dictated his own bulletin, but Wilson said it was inaccurate and misleading and he could not possibly sign it. Elaborate textual negotiations led to a compromise, and subsequent bulletins always referred to his improving condition. 
A further bout of pneumonia in August 1944 was not publicised at all, and according to his wife, Clementine, only the smallest circle was informed. 
Similarly, the cocktail of drugs being taken by Anthony Eden during the Suez crisis was known only to a few, and even now the impact on his judgment is a matter of dispute. 
But these were more discreet times, and the ruling class could form a small circle of trust. That in turn made it easier to put out bland medical bulletins that disguised more than they revealed. 
The White House has been equally skilled at suppressing the truth about its president’s health. Franklin D Roosevelt famously had polio, Dwight D Eisenhower had both a heart attack and a stroke while in office. John F Kennedy suffered Addison’s disease, hypothyroidism and severe back pain, none of which was publicly disclosed during his lifetime. Grover Cleveland in 1893 even had a secret operation to remove a cancerous growth that took place on a boat, dressed up as a fishing trip on a lake. 
The fear that power, credibility and respect will seep away if ill health is revealed remains. Not just the electorate will lose faith, but your cabinet colleagues may sniff a succession. Tony Blair was reluctant to reveal his heart issues for fear allies of the the then chancellor, Gordon Brown, might take advantage. 
Hillary Clinton was hammered when she contracted pneumonia, and wobbled in front of the TV cameras when walking to a car. In 2016 news of her illness received 13 times more coverage than revelations about fraud in Trump’s charitable foundation. Bernie Sanders has frantically denied his heart attack makes him the weaker of the three septuagenarians seeking the presidency. 
But outright suppression of the truth in modern politics has its downsides. Figures such as Peter Mandelson, Gordon Brown’s chief communicator after the financial crash, have warned the prerequisite for national unity at a time of genuine crisis is a government that levels with the British public about the difficulties the Whitehall machine is facing.  
There will come a point when, if Johnson’s condition is serious, the medical and spin doctors will have to tell the public as much."
131,health,Australia to unveil $2.4bn coronavirus health package including pop-up fever clinics,"Up to 100 new pop-up fever clinics, a $30m advertising campaign and a Medicare item for telehealth consultations will form part of a $2.4bn government health package aimed at slowing the spread of coronavirus. 
The health response, to be unveiled by the Morrison government on Wednesday, comes as Australia recorded its 100th confirmed case of coronavirus, and as doctors criticised the “confusing” process that had seen patients queuing for hours at public hospitals to access a test for the Covid-19 virus. 
The government is also finalising a “substantial” multifaceted economic stimulus package, expected to be detailed on Thursday, aimed at averting a widely tipped recession that could end Australia’s 29-year record of uninterrupted economic growth. 
The prime minister, Scott Morrison, and health minister, Greg Hunt, will announce details of the health package on Wednesday, with the health sector to receive a $2.4bn funding injection to help cope with the looming crisis. 
 
  Related: Australian government won't 'jump to a solution' to help casual workers in coronavirus crisis  
 
A key part of the package will be $205m for up to 100 new pop-up fever clinics that will be located in areas of need, and which will test people who are concerned they may have the virus. 
The aim is to divert people with mild or moderate symptoms away from hospital emergency departments and GP clinics to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. Severe cases will still present at hospitals. 
Each of the slated clinics, to be staffed by GPs and nurses, will be able to see up to 75 patients a day over six months, with the potential of testing up to a million individuals within the next six months. 
Some of the new clinics will be established in existing practices, while others will be set up as standalone pop-up centres, with existing clinics to receive an initial $150,000 to set up and to help offset losses from normal business. 
While the government has indicated a pandemic is likely, efforts have so far been aimed at slowing the spread of the virus to allow the health system to cope with an expected surge in demand. Authorities are warning the spread of the disease could peak as early as May, ahead of the normal winter flu season. 
Today’s package will also include a new Medicare item to allow doctors to charge for phone or video consultations for people with coronavirus symptoms who remain at home in self-isolation and quarantine, costing $100m for the next six months. 
The service, which will start on Friday, is aimed at reducing the risk of exposure to others in the community and will be fully bulk billed. 
It will be made available to people isolating themselves at home on the advice of a medical practitioner or the guidance of the chief medical officer, and those who meet the “protocol criteria” for suspected infection based on advice from coronavirus hotline numbers or other trained staff. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
Vulnerable groups, including those aged over 70, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged over 50, those with chronic health conditions, parents with new babies and people who are pregnant, will also be able to use the service. 
Any doctor forced into home isolation or quarantine will be able to continue providing services to their patients via telehealth, “as long as they have the capacity to provide services safely and in accordance with normal professional standards from home or other isolation area”. 
The funding boost will be accompanied by a national $30m communications campaign, expected to start within days, that will have information to “prevent and mitigate the impacts of coronavirus”. 
Morrison said the package, which also includes a $500m hospital funding package already announced for the states, would ensure Australia was as well prepared “as any country in the world” to respond to the virus threat. 
“We’re ensuring our health system is well-prepared and has the resources it needs for our fight against coronavirus,” Morrison said, ahead of Wednesday’s announcement. 
“Our medical experts have been preparing for an event like this for years and this is the next step up in Australia’s plan.”

The health minister, Greg Hunt, said the government’s focus was on ensuring the capacity of the health system to be able to effectively assess, diagnose and treat people with the virus in a way that minimised the spread of the disease in the community. 
“We are ensuring people can access essential care in a way that reduces their potential exposure to infection,” he said. 
On Tuesday, the shadow health minister, Chris Bowen, said the telehealth rebate and a better testing process needed to be “urgent” priorities for the government, and also backed the need for a comprehensive public information campaign. 
He also called for the government to increase resources for pathology testing, a new information app, and for the government to respond to concerns from GPs about access to medical supplies such as face masks and protective equipment. 
“Some doctors have said to me that they are getting enough support but many have said they’re not and really we cannot have any situation where a doctor feels they are not getting enough support,” Bowen said. 
“We’ve given the government time, we’ve given the government constructive engagement but the time has now passed for discussion, we need to give GPs and healthcare professionals every support possible.”"
132,health,Poorest adults in worse health now than older generation – study,"The poorest third of the UK’s older working-age adults today have worse health than people born a century ago had at the same age, according to research that also shows the health gap between rich and poor is growing. The study is the latest to show widening health inequalities. A report compiled by the Centre for Progressive Policy thinktank last year found dramatic regional differences in healthy life expectancy around the UK. It found that people living in former mining towns in Blaenau Gwent spend about 16 fewer years in good health than those living in Wokingham.  Meanwhile, official figures show the number of GPs working in more deprived areas is falling. Dr Stephen Jivraj, the author of the new study from University College London, said it took a different approach to other research as it focused on generational differences rather than differences across survey years. It found that the poorest people are experiencing ill health earlier in life – a situation that means, given the size of postwar cohorts, that public health services will face rising demands. “The pressure on the NHS, for example, is going to be even greater than expected given the ageing population,” said Jivraj. The study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, involved an analysis of data collected from the annual British General Household Survey between 1979 and 2011, and focused on adults aged between 30 and 59. In general, participants were not surveyed more than once. Jivraj found that among men and women in the lowest third for household income, those born in the late 1960s reported higher levels of limiting long-term illness than those born in the early 1920s. No such trend was seen for women among the middle or richest third of the population. Among men in the wealthier two-thirds of the population there was a drop in limiting long-term illness among later cohorts.  Overall, 32% of the poorest third of women born in 1968-1970 reported a limiting long-term illness when aged between 30 and 59, compared with 12% of the richest third. In those born in 1920-22, the prevalence was 23% among the poorest and 13% among the richest. In other words, the later generation had a far larger health gap than the earlier one.  In men the gap was 24 percentage points in the later generation and nine percentage points in the earlier one. A widening gap across generations was also seen when it came to reports of general health, although the overall trend was less stark.    Related: Inequality: is it rising, and can we reverse it?    The study has limitations, including that it is based on self-reporting, and that data from 29,058 individuals was used for the 1947-49 birth cohort and only 2,457 individuals for the 1920-22 cohort. While the study does not unpick what may be driving the widening health gap, Jivraj noted that the trends were similar to those seen in household income where the gap has widened over the years. He said it may also be linked to factors such as smoking or lack of secure housing. Ben Franklin, the head of research at the Centre for Progressive Policy, said the study added to a growing body of literature showing a widening gap in the health of people with higher and lower socioeconomic status. “We have got the NHS, which is a great thing for the UK, and it helps to level up the UK in terms of ensuring equality of access to world-class healthcare, but that alone is not going to solve persistent and growing health inequalities,” he said. “Obviously there are things in society that are happening to poorer people that are meaning that they get ill more than wealthier people. So actually if we are going to deal with our health inequalities in society, we need much greater upstream prevention.”"
133,health,Health minister says Australia cannot predict how many will die from coronavirus,"The federal government is “not in a position” to give projections about how many Australians may be infected or die from the coronavirus, the health minister Greg Hunt said, with 128 infections including three deaths confirmed. “We are not at this stage in a position to put out particular figures because the modelling has been evolving all of the time,” Hunt told reporters on Tuesday in a press conference with the deputy chief medical officer Prof Paul Kelly. Kelly added: “We are getting the best modellers in Australia who are linked with the international community to look at a variety of scenarios, but as minister Hunt said, the most important thing at the moment is finding cases, finding the contacts and isolating. That is the way we slow down the epidemic and decrease the number of cases in our community.”   Related: Coronavirus latest: at a glance    In recent days researchers have made a variety of predictions about how widespread the impact of the virus might be, including projections that up to 70% of Australians could become infected and 400,000 may die, or that 3,000 people might die “in a best case estimate”. But chair of the Infection Prevention and Control Expert Advisory Group, Prof Lyn Gilbert, said: “The estimates are often so widely different you’re probably better off not believing any of them”. “There are a group of modellers doing a lot of work informing the decisions of government, but specific figures are not being mentioned by government for good reason – because everyone recognises modelling at this stage of an epidemic has limitations,” Gilbert said. “It’s too complicated to be putting numbers out there in the public domain without being able to explain what the data is based on, and also what assumptions are made about the policies implemented which also make a difference in terms of how long it takes local transmission to occur and when the outbreak will peak. “Governments make decisions based on a range of possibilities and other factors that may change.” On Thursday morning, the premier of New South Wales, Gladys Berejiklian, announced there were now 77 cases across that state, out of 128 in Australia. Most of the cases are patients who have travelled overseas or who have had close contact with a confirmed case in Australia. But NSW’s chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said there were cases presenting in the state without an obvious epidemiological link, suggesting the Covid-19 was spreading in the community undetected. “What is more challenging is that we have had cases where we can’t find an epidemiological link,” Chant said. “Overnight, we have seen cases being diagnosed in people without overseas travel. Those cases are being thoroughly interviewed to ensure that we can identify any links to other confirmed cases to build up our picture.” Infectious diseases physician Prof Peter Collignon described some of the estimates of Australian infections and deaths as “garbage”. “We don’t have enough parameters to do any accurate modelling and I still think that’s the case,” he said. “We still don’t have an antibody test. The current test is a PCR test, which tests the virus’s genetic material and the trouble is you only really pick up people with symptoms and not milder disease. You can’t fine-tune modelling until there is more accurate data.” Once an antibody test was developed, he said, researchers would have a better indication of the true infection and mortality rate. “What we do know is that people who are older have a much higher chance of dying even without having all the denominators available yet,” Collignon said. “The older you are the more at risk you are. That’s quite clear. That’s not a reason to panic it’s a reason to be alert and to do the things you should do all the time. “It’s silly to say not to worry, but that’s different to panicking and doing things that are inappropriate, like panic-buying.”   Related: Closed borders and ‘black weddings’: what the 1918 flu teaches us about coronavirus    Hand-washing, getting a flu-shot (since being infected with influenza may make people more vulnerable to coronavirus), and following self-isolation and testing guidelines could significantly curb the rate of infection and deaths, he added. Professor of epidemiology Mary-Louise McLaws said modelling could be useful but its disadvantage was it was only as good as the quality of data input. “Data that is not included in much of the modelling is data on how people behave,” she said. “How do people respond to a request by authorities to self-isolate? How good they are at washing their hands? If people are good at all of those measures the numbers will be contained more easily. There are so many factors to consider.” “Hopefully Australians will pull together and act like a cohesive population because we know that will help keep numbers of infection down. I would be hesitant looking just at the best and worst case scenarios because for a novel virus it can be a very inexact science. It’s helpful for planning potential hospital beds and the response, but providing good health care is complex.”"
134,health,Covid-19 outbreak: what do health experts mean by 'flattening the curve'?,"In their response to the coronavirus outbreak, public health experts and government officials have repeatedly referenced the importance of “flattening the curve”. But what does this mean, exactly? When faced by a threat such as Covid-19, epidemiologists often look for two important numbers: how infectious a disease is, quantified by the number of people infected by each person infected, and the total number of people who die as a result of catching the illness. Covid-19 appears to be more infectious than the common flu and the cause of a higher rate of deaths. But these rates aren’t immutable, with the differing pattern of the virus’s spread in various countries showing that interventions can make a big difference. Without protective measures to slow the spread of Covid-19, there is likely to be a large spike in infections in a short period of time. This scenario risks overwhelming health systems, with the parlous situation in Italy illustrating the dangers of when a country is hit by a wave of new cases. Hospitals can struggle to cope with the influx, leading to a higher mortality rate.   .   A key goal of public health officials now is to avoid a huge peak in Covid-19 cases in favour of a slower growth that becomes a moderate plateau. Infections still occur, but over a longer period – and “flattening the curve” turns the steep mountain of cases into a more sedate hillock. This more gentle increase in cases gives health systems the time to adapt and absorb the new patients, ensure that the virus is not spread further and effectively treat the most vulnerable. Many of the measures we have seen around the world to restrict travel and large gatherings are aimed at ensuring coronavirus does not run riot. “Through aggressive sanitation efforts, diligent hand-washing, canceling large gatherings, minimizing travel, teleworking, and similar measures we can *flatten out the epidemic curve*, keeping the number of people simultaneously infected at a low enough level to be manageable,” tweeted Carl Bergstrom, a biologist at the University of Washington who co-created a widely shared graph illustrating the flattening of the curve. “The steps we take now, individually and as a community, will determine the trajectory of the #COVID19 epidemic. This in turn will determine how many lives are lost. It is not just a matter of protecting yourself; it is a matter of protecting the most vulnerable among us.”"
135,health,Australian government pumps $1bn into health and family violence services as coronavirus spreads,"The Morrison government will expand funding for telehealth, domestic violence support and mental health services, as well as boosting the emergency relief delivered through charities and community organisations, as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Australia passes 3,600 and the national death toll stands at 14. The government announced on Sunday morning that it is allocating more than $1bn to a range of support services, including $669m to expand Medicare-subsidised telehealth services and $150m under the national domestic violence initiative. The government says there has been a surge in the number of Google searches looking for support services for domestic violence during the pandemic. The bulk billing incentive for GPs providing telehealth consultations during the crisis will be doubled. The government will also provide an incentive payment to ensure practices stay open to provide face-to-face services when necessary. The funding boost will be in place until the end of September.     Sign up for Guardian Australia’s daily coronavirus email newsletter   Mental health programs will be boosted by $74m, including $10m for a dedicated coronavirus wellbeing support line, delivered by Beyond Blue, to help people experiencing concern due to a coronavirus diagnosis, or experiencing stress or anxiety due to employment changes, business closure, financial difficulties, family pressures or other challenges.   Related: 'Covid-19 will slam the door shut': Australia's family services brace for domestic violence spike    An additional $14m will go to mental health support providers, including $5m for Lifeline and $2m for Kids Helpline. The government says mental health support services have experienced an unprecedented surge in call volumes during the pandemic. The government is promising dedicated support services for health workers, and an additional $10m for the community visitors scheme to ensure elderly people in aged care aren’t isolated by coronavirus-related restrictions on visitors. The government says the funding will mean extra staff can be engaged to train volunteer visitors to connect with elderly people online and the the phone. A community support package worth $200m will scale up services through the national debt helpline and increase funding to food relief organisations to source additional food and transport for emergency relief service providers. In a statement, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the funding would flow immediately. “As we battle coronavirus on both the health and economic fronts with significant support packages in place and more to come, I am very aware many Australians are understandably anxious, stressed and fearful about the impacts of coronavirus and what it brings,” he said. “We are focused on saving lives and saving livelihoods and this new support package will provide much needed care and help to so many Australians facing hardship at no fault of their own.” As well as the support package outlined on Sunday, the government is working up a third round of safety net measures on the assumption that swathes of the economy will move into a period of suspended animation as lockdowns take effect. Conceptually, the government wants to ensure that businesses don’t emerge from the pandemic with substantial liabilities on their books that would force them to either declare bankruptcy or sack substantial numbers of workers. Restrictions already in place to slow the spread of coronavirus have caused a major economic shock and triggered thousands of local job losses over the past week, and the government has unveiled two stimulus packages over the past three weeks worth $189bn.

136,health,"Coronavirus spread at Rikers is a 'public health disaster', says jail's top doctor","The top doctor at Rikers Island said the coronavirus-hit New York jail is a “public health disaster unfolding before our eyes” as he warned of the rapidly rising number of infections in the city’s jails. 
In just 12 days, Ross MacDonald, the jail’s chief physician, said confirmed cases at Rikers had soared from one to nearly 200.

Speaking in response to a letter from five New York district attorneys and a special narcotics prosecutor criticising the release of “high-risk” inmates following the outbreak of Covid-19, he wrote on Twitter this week: “The only part of the letter I can speak directly to is their failure to appreciate the public health disaster unfolding before our eyes.” 
The notorious Rikers Island jail complex, one of the largest jails in the world, has become synonymous with violence and neglect, and is scheduled to shutter in 2026. 
Despite following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and having “moved mountains to protect our patients”, MacDonald said infections were soaring. 
He added: “This is not a generational public health crisis, rather it is a crisis of a magnitude no generation living today has ever seen.” 
He warned that it is “unlikely” they will be able to stop the growth, predicting that 20% of those infected will need hospital treatment and 5% ventilators. 
He also called for the release of “as many vulnerable people as possible”.

More than 2.2 million people are incarcerated in the US, more than anywhere in the world, and there are growing fears that an outbreak could spread rapidly through a vast network of federal and state prisons, county jails and detention centers. 
With limited capacity nationally to test for Covid-19, men and women prisoners worry that they are last in line for information about the risks, and for treatment if showing flu-like symptoms. 
According to figures published by the Legal Aid Society, on Tuesday there were 180 cases of coronavirus in New York city jails, including Rikers, out of a population of 4,604 – 13 more cases than the day before. 
The infection rate for the city’s jails was 3.91%, equating to 39.1 infections per 1,000 people. In comparison, the infection rate for New York city was 0.5%, or five infections per 1,000 people. 
Jared Trujillo, president of the Association of Legal Aid Attorneys, said Rikers was effectively the centre of the entire pandemic. 
“Now, Rikers proportionately is the epicentre of the Covid-19 epidemic and our clients are terrified, my members of the union are horrified about it, they’re horrified for their clients, being in court is dangerous for them. We have about two dozen members, probably more, that have either tested positive or just showing signs of Covid-19.” 
For some vulnerable prisoners, he added, being in jail amid a coronavirus outbreak is “ultimately a death sentence for them”.

He claimed a lot of inmates, many of whom he said are pre-trial, don’t have access to hand sanitiser or soap, are “caged” in large communal areas and that many clients have complained that they are not having symptoms of illness taken seriously. 
He said the current environment is also having an impact on their mental health. “Just psychologically it’s really horrifying for people because they’re hearing that these people that they’ve been in close contact with, that they have been caged with for some length of time, have an illness, have a contagion, and there’s just nothing they can do.” 
Unless more action is taken to release people from Rikers, he warned: “The conditions will only get worse.” 
As of Tuesday morning, 141 staff members and 180 prisoners on Rikers Island and other city jails had tested positive for coronavirus. The city’s department of correction (DOC) said those people have been advised to self-quarantine and that they are following city guidelines to identify people they may have had contact with. 
Peter Thorne, deputy commissioner of public information for New York City’s DOC, said it is doing “everything we can to safely and humanely house people in our custody amid the broader Covid-19 crisis”. 
He added: “We have made tremendous efforts to increase social distancing throughout our facilities and escalated our hygiene and sanitation protocols in accordance with guidance from the city’s department of health. We work closely with correctional health services to ensure that those who are symptomatic are promptly isolated and referred for treatment as necessary.” 
The DOC said there was an “adequate supply of soap and cleaning products” and that all prisoners have access to sinks, soap and water. However, they are not allowed hand sanitiser because it is seen as a “security risk”. 
They said any employee with respiratory problems is sent home and is not allowed back without documentation from a medical professional that they do not have Covid-19 or flu. 
Measures also include screening any person entering the jail “ for flu-like symptoms”, isolating prisoners “if clinically indicated” that they may have Covid-19 and placing any new arrivals with symptoms or people in custody who have tested positive in a separate facility.

Across the state, Trujillo said the problems are “similar” and called for more people to be released – particularly the elderly and the immunocompromised. 
“It’s just something that’s so terrifying for people that are in, but then also their families, and it’s even exacerbated by the fact that right now people aren’t getting visits,” he added. 
New York state’s department of corrections and community supervision (DOCCS) said that as of Tuesday morning, 123 employees, 14 prisoners and nine people on parole were confirmed to have coronavirus. 
For each confirmed case, a DOCCS spokeswoman said they work with the department of health to identify people who have potentially been exposed and notify them to try to stop it spreading. 
She said that staff and prisoners have been given information on preventive measures and they have suspended transfers and visitors. 
The Bureau of Prisons has temporarily halted visitation at all 122 federal correctional facilities across the US, including both social and legal visitation, though officials have said some exceptions could be made for legal visits.

137,health,Private health sector's claim of closure after coronavirus elective surgery shutdown is 'disingenuous',"Health policy analysts and economists have accused the private hospital sector of being disingenuous and sparking public panic by saying without government assistance they will be forced to close due to the cancellation of non-essential elective surgery during the Covid-19 pandemic. On Saturday, a coalition of private hospital operators warned the suspension of most semi-urgent and all non-urgent elective surgeries had strangled their revenue streams and would force them to close within days. On Monday, state and territory health ministers and premiers were holding talks with the sector to come to an agreement about how private staff and resources can be utilised elsewhere. Ahead of the talks Victorian premier Daniel Andrews said staff in private hospitals “have a unique set of skills”. “We will make the best use of those skills to fight this virus,” he said, adding that “one consolidated system of care” would be required in response to Covid-19. The chief executive of Healthe Care, Australia’s third biggest private hospital operator, previously told Guardian Australia the prime minister, Scott Morrison, had caught the sector by surprise when he announced that non-urgent elective surgery would be banned from midnight that night.   Related: Australia's private hospitals face closure after coronavirus causes elective surgery ban    But chair of the Australian Healthcare Alliance Jennifer Doggett said: “The private hospital sector is being completely disingenuous by claiming that the elective surgery shutdown was sudden.” “This measure had been called for repeatedly by medical experts and peak bodies such as the Australian Medical Association for weeks and was clear,” she said. “The private hospital sector is only one of many industries suffering from a loss of business due to the pandemic – they should not be entitled to any more support than any other private business.” Doggett said it was essential the mixed public and private health system in Australia had a plan in place for diverting resources from elective to urgent services when required. This plan should have been developed prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, she said, “so that it could be implemented promptly and without the political opportunism that is being displayed currently by the private hospital sector”. Doggett added that private hospitals benefited from significant amounts of government funding, via Medicare and the private health insurance rebate. “As part of this public funding they should be required to work collaboratively with government in a national health crisis situation,” she said. “This would at least deliver some returns to Australians for the billions of tax payer dollars invested into the private health sector every year. The Covid-19 pandemic should make it clear that Australians have been misled about the importance of private health insurance by governments and the private health sector. “I guess they are used to being treated as a special case and getting bailed out by government.” Health economist Stephen Duckett, the health program director at the Grattan Institute, said private hospitals were not the only sector forced to stand down staff and close doors.   Related: Private health insurance is in crisis! Help help | First Dog on the Moon    “Many businesses have collapsed,” he said. “The question is, should private hospitals be treated any differently from any other industry and get any extra support? I haven’t seen an argument from private hospitals about why, if staff are stood down now, they wouldn’t be available in a few weeks when they are needed, so it’s not like this is permanent. I just haven’t seen an argument aside from them making statements designed to pressure the government and attract public sympathy.” He said the sector should not be provided with any financial relief from government until they were called in to assist with the Covid-19 response. “I would hope that by now contractual arrangements are in place so they can swing into action when public hospital system risks being overwhelmed and that’s when they should be paid by government,” Duckett said. Consumers Health Forum CEO Leanne Wells said in times of crisis the public and private sectors must work together. “To reduce what we know is going to be mounting pressure on public hospitals and to assure consumers our system’s capacity is being optimised, we urge the government and private hospitals to work together to ensure that private infrastructure and workforce, rather than being shutdown and stood down, is deployed as part of the community-wide campaign to fight the virus,” she said."
138,health,One-stop shops needed for women's health services,"One-stop shops should open in the high street, where women can go to get contraception, screening services, menopause advice and help with other health needs, while the morning-after pill should be sold off the shelf without consultation, say leading UK experts. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which has been working on a blueprint for women’s health services for more than a year in conjunction with other groups and government, says services for women need to be completely overhauled to give them far more control over their health. Its report launched today in the House of Commons, called Better for Women, says women with busy lives struggle to get the healthcare and advice they need. It sets out a strategy for reshaping the present fragmented NHS systems that require women to see different nurses and doctors in a variety of specialised clinics, as well as their GP practice, for procedures that should be routine. A survey of 3,000 women shows that large numbers find it hard to get advice and care near home. More than a third (37%) said they could not get contraception services locally and 60% could not easily access unplanned pregnancy services, including abortion care. The all-time high level of abortions is connected to the unmet contraceptive needs of women, says the report. In 2018, there were 200,608 abortions across England and Wales – an increase of 4% on the previous year.   Related: Revealed: NHS plans to ration 34 everyday tests and treatments    Over a third (34%) of women did not attend their last cervical cancer smear test, the survey shows. Only half had locally available sexually transmitted infection services, 56% struggled to get help for painful periods and 58% could not get menopause services locally. It’s not just special pleading for women, said Lesley Regan, president of the college. Many are carers and mothers and they influence the healthcare behaviours of everyone else. “If you get it right for women, you get it right for lots of other people,” she said. Many of the services women need are preventive, such as cancer screening and contraception. Many are paid for from the public health budget, through local authorities, and have been cut because of the 40% reduction in that budget, said Regan. “Women are falling through the cracks of very basic services that should be very easy to prevent or access,” she said. “This is not rocket science. We are not suggesting an expensive new solution. We’re just saying we need to think about women across their life course because so many of the things that affect women, for which they need the NHS, are predictable. “We’re not delivering what women need where they need it,” she said. A smear test, contraception and an STI check could all be done by the same person in 15 minutes, she said. “But at the moment, girls and women are being pushed around from pillar to post because a nurse or the health practitioner or the GP that they visit hasn’t got the commission to actually do the other things as well.”   Related: The real reason the morning-after pill costs so much in pharmacies    Some 45% of pregnancies are now unplanned, she said. “What we do know is that when they’re not planned, they have much more complex outcomes often, and that means they are more expensive to deliver, and we see the abortion rate is not going up in girls – the teenage-pregnancy strategy has worked very well – it’s in the 40-year-olds who can’t access contraception.” Women should not have to go back to the GP for a new prescription for the pill every three months when it has been heavily researched for the last 60 years. “It’s far more dangerous to get pregnant than it is to be on the pill,” she said. Girls and women should be able to get the very safe progestogen-only pill from a pharmacist or online, the report says. The morning-after pill should be sold straight off the shelf without the need to speak to a doctor or pharmacist. The report says all young people should be educated from an early age about women’s health, and health issues such as the support during menopause should be embedded in workplace policies. The college says the changes would save money by enabling women to stay in better health. Sexual health experts from the faculty of sexual and reproductive healthcare and the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) voiced support. Gill Walton, chief executive of the RCM, backed its findings, including those on abortion, which she said should be regarded as just another medical procedure. “This is an important report that puts women at the centre of health improvement that needs governments and those running our health services to take notice. Our whole health service needs to focus much more on prevention of ill health, and to invest in our health and social services to support that,” she said. "
139,health,Health alliance warns Brexit can leave UK exposed to global outbreaks,"Tackling global outbreaks such as coronavirus could become harder if the UK loses access to the EU’s early warning system for cross-border threats without finding an effective replacement, according to an alliance of health bodies. 
Public health is at risk if health is not made a priority in the forthcoming negotiations with the EU, according to the Brexit Health Alliance (BHA), an umbrella group led by the NHS Confederation which encompasses the NHS, medical research, industry, patients and public health bodies. 
The BHA has urged the government to prioritise continued cooperation with key EU agencies, such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and access platforms like the early warning and response system to deal with serious cross-border public health threats, such as pandemics and infectious diseases.

“Infectious diseases do not respect borders and we need to tackle them together,” said Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation and BHA co-chair. 
“It is in all our interests to maintain these vital links between the UK and the EU not least because working together we are more likely to trace and tackle serious outbreaks effectively.” 
Last week Boris Johnson said there was “no need” for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules and has previously stated that the UK could “develop separate and independent policies” in a range of fields. 
The alliance has also called for guarantees that critical medicines and medical devices will continue to be able to flow into and out of the UK and Europe, and that UK and EU residents should be able to access affordable healthcare when travelling in EU member states. It called on the government to ensure there was a continued role for the UK in Europe-wide research. 
 
  
  
   
    
    The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.
    The UN agency&nbsp;advises&nbsp;people to:
    
     Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap
     Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing
     Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough
     Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers
     Advice about face masks varies. Wearing them while out and about may offer some protection against both spreading and catching the virus via coughs and sneezes, but it is not a cast-iron guarantee of protection
    
    Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.&nbsp;
    In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;stay at home for at least 7 days.
    If you live with other people,&nbsp;they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.
    
   
  
  
 
“Our worry is that all sides in these negotiations are under massive time pressures to agree a future trade deal and so there is a risk that the safety and health of patients and citizens across Europe could be overlooked,” said Dickson. 
“There is no reason why leaving the EU should mean that the UK and the EU cannot maintain existing arrangements but if we are to achieve this health has to be seen as a priority, alongside business, in the negotiations. We would also like to see early agreements to protect patient safety, give citizens rights to healthcare, provide access to medicines and support medical research.” 
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The UK firmly believes that cross-border health threats, such as pandemics, can only be effectively tackled through international collaboration and we remain committed to working with countries and partners across the world to protect the UK.”"

His family said that if he had had the correct personal protective equipment, he might still be alive. Goodmayes hospital claimed there were “no symptomatic patients on the ward”. However, a former colleague told the BBC that Harvey contracted the virus after treating a patient who later tested positive.     Amged El-Hawrani.

His death prompted tributes from ministers and senior health leaders. In a statement, his family said he was “a loving and much-loved husband, son, father, brother, and friend”. “His greatest passions were his family and his profession, and he dedicated his life to both,” they said. “We would like to thank all those involved in his care for their kindness and compassion during his illness. They worked tirelessly for their patient, as he would have done for his own.”     Pooja Sharma.

A friend, Amarjit Aujla, paid tribute on Facebook: “Her laughter was contagious and her random calls made my day. From when we were in primary school until we last spoke two weeks ago, you gave me nothing but love, support and a tummy ache with all the laughter. “Life can never be the same without you my dear friend.” Lara Stacey Young, a nurse in the area, said: “So many people will be devastated. She was such a lovely soul.” Sharma’s father, Sudhir, 61, was an immigration officer at Heathrow, but officials said it was likely he had contracted the virus elsewhere. He had been away from work since 7 January due to “underlying health problems”.     Andy Howe.

He died on the way to hospital after falling ill, his employer said. A spokesman for the RMT union said: “We are saddened by the news of Andy’s passing. We’re also angered by the reports we have received about a lack of duty of care for Andy, his colleagues and the wider public.” He said this included reports of toilets and buses not being cleaned properly, and a lack of protective screens or masks. CT4N, the operator of the bus service, denied the allegation and said it had been “rigorously following government health and safety advice”. Andrew Grieve from CT4N said Howe was a “popular” and “well-respected” member of the team and said everyone was “devastated” by his death.

He had been volunteering in A&amp;E departments in the Midlands to help the NHS cope with the virus. “He wanted to be deployed where he would be most useful in the crisis,” said his cousin, the broadcaster Zeinab Badawi. “It had taken just 12 days for Adil to go from a seemingly fit and capable doctor working in a busy hospital to lying in a hospital morgue.” His former colleague Abbas Ghazanfar, a renal transplant surgeon at St George’s hospital in Tooting, described Tayar as a “noble human being” who was a “hardworking, dedicated surgeon”.

The couple’s four children all work in the medical profession. Their daughter Dr Sarah Zaidi, also a GP, said his death was “reflective of his sacrifice”, adding: “He had a vocational attitude to service.” She said: “We can’t mourn in the normal way. We can’t have a normal funeral. He left a gaping hole in our hearts, but a loss that is also felt within the community that he devoted almost his entire life to. We are praying for the safety of everyone right now.”"
141,health,Doctor who had coronavirus demands apology from Victorian health minister over 'inaccuracies',"General practitioners have rallied behind a Melbourne doctor who tested positive for coronavirus and demanded an apology from the Victorian health minister who they say has maligned frontline health workers. It comes as the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia reaches 75. Dr Chis Higgins saw approximately 70 patients while recovering from what he believed to be a mild cold last week, before he tested positive for Covid-19. He had flown in from the US on Saturday morning. All of those patients, including two he visited at Malvern’s Mecwacare nursing home, as well as all the clinical staff at the Toorak Clinic where Higgins is a GP, have since been told to self-isolate for 14 days.   Related: 'Flabbergasted': Melbourne doctor with coronavirus symptoms continued seeing patients    The health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said on Saturday that she was “flabbergasted that a doctor that has flu-like symptoms has presented to work”, and that his decision to continue to treat patients while unwell may be a matter for the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency to pursue. “I understand our medical and healthcare workers are dedicated to the work they do … But it is irresponsible for people to be going to work if they are unwell, and that is not just healthcare workers, it is everybody in the community who needs to take this very seriously,” Mikakos said. She did not name the doctor, but the Toorak Clinic only has eight GPs. The federal president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Tony Bartone, said the doctor had acted in good faith and in accordance with current guidelines, which do not recommend testing or isolation for people who become unwell upon returning from the US, and that Mikakos’s comments were “very disappointing indeed”. Bartone said the minister should apologise. He also challenged suggestions GPs were well-resourced and had been kept well-informed during the outbreak. “What is clear is that … there has been an inconsistency of messaging through various parts of the system,” he said. “We have an official online advisory site that is supposed to guide but clearly there have been times where various states and territories have had different messaging to their communities. “We have to start acting as one if we’re to deal with this threat of Covid-19 and assure that we have not only the briefs of truth online but that we are singing from the same song sheet, we know what is expected of us, and that information is clearly communicated in real-time and updated as quickly as necessary.” Higgins, the father of the singer Missy Higgins, responded in a comment on Mikakos’s Facebook page, saying: “As the doctor concerned, I have been upset about the inaccuracies and unfairness of your comments. “This is not the story that I told the DHSS whose job it is to relay information to you. I had a mild cold when I returned from the USA last Saturday morning which had almost resolved itself by Monday morning, hence my decision to return to work. “I hesitated to do a swab because I did not fulfil your criteria for testing but did one anyway on Thursday evening for sake of completeness, not imagining for one moment it would turn out to be positive. “I believe you have taken a cheap opportunity for political grandstanding and would appreciate an apology.”    Public shaming of a frontline health care worker, who has not breached guidelines is not ok. Breaching privacy of any patient is not ok. Eroding public confidence in doctors right now is not ok. Please make this right @JennyMikakos #istandwithChrisHiggins pic.twitter.com/lZGVxAj6In&mdash; Jodi Culbert (@DrJodi28) March 7, 2020    GPs rushed to support Higgins on social media, saying that Mikakos owed him a public apology and should resign as minister. Many doctors said they frequently worked when they had a mild cold. They also criticised Mikakos for saying GPs were “fully resourced”. “As a GP, and clinic owner, I have been extremely worried about our ability to care for our patients in this pandemic with inadequate ppe [personal protective equipment] stocks provided,” Dr Elaine Sung said. “Turns out we also need to be worried about ministers trashing our reputation when we follow departmental guidelines.” Some doctors that the minister’s comments, on top of a shortage of PPE, meant they did not want to see patients who may have coronavirus. “They can all divert to the hospital and when all their doctors are off on self isolation you can find a solution to the problem you created,” Dr Susan Swanston said, in response to Mikakos’s post. “Do not expect GPs to bale out your overwhelmed health services, we owe you nothing. You reap what you sow!”   Related: Coronavirus: US deaths rise to 19 as New York declares state of emergency    Mikakos responded to the criticism late Saturday night, saying that public safety was her priority. “We will always protect patient privacy,” she said, in another Facebook post. “However we have a public health duty to the wider community to provide information about exposure points, which require details such as business locations and flights to be made public to allow for contact tracing. “I know this can be very challenging and distressing for those involved and I am deeply sympathetic to this, but public safety has to be our priority.” She said she would continue to work with the federal government to ensure GPs have the support they need, including access to the national stockpile of personal protective equipment such as masks. The Australian government has acquired an additional 54 million facemasks for the national medical stockpile, the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said on Sunday. Hunt said the masks would be made available for medical and aged care workers."
142,health,How a global health crisis turns into a state-run surveillance opportunity,"When Barack Obama was US president, his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, had a useful motto: “Never let a serious crisis go to waste: it’s an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.” The Chinese authorities have clearly taken this to heart – as evidenced by the unprecedented scale of their geographical lockdowns and quarantining, restrictions on movement, industrial slowdowns and heightened surveillance. At this distance, it’s impossible to judge how effective these measures really are. But all the experienced China-watchers of my acquaintance tell me that one should never underestimate the gap between realities on the ground and the story as told from Beijing. An instructive illustration of this is provided by a fascinating dispatch from Wuhan in the London Review of Books. It’s by Wang Xiuying (who describes herself as “a pessimist who’s trying hard to stay positive in self-quarantine”). She tells of a good deal of local chaos and serious tensions between the provincial authorities and the big cheeses in Beijing. She also describes great local heroism (particularly among health workers) and self-sacrifice. All of which sounds more plausible to me. One thing that does appear to be happening in China, however, is deployment of the state’s surveillance capabilities. At the heart of the project is the ubiquity of smartphones. According to the New York Times, citizens are now being required to install an app on their phones that dictates whether they should be quarantined or allowed into subways, malls and other public spaces. People sign up for the “Alipay health code” and are assigned a colour code – green, yellow or red – that indicates their health status. A green code enables its holder to move about unrestricted. Someone with a yellow code may be asked to stay at home for seven days. Red means a two-week quarantine.    'Code red' travellers are tracked back to their family homes where police tape is put over their front doors    The system is already in use in 200 cities and is being rolled out nationwide. The NYT report has an interesting video showing a subway guard checking every passenger’s colour code as they go past the gate. But an analysis of the app’s code found that it does more than decide in real time whether someone poses a contagion risk; it also shares information with the police, setting “a template for new forms of automated social control that could persist long after the epidemic subsides”. Writing in the Georgetown Journal of International Affairs, the legal scholar John Palfrey describes how this system has been used to track “code red” travellers through subway and railway networks back to their family homes in Wuhan, where police tape is put over their front doors and neighbours are asked to call a hotline if they see anyone leave the premises. Meanwhile, back in the UK, we’re in a “phoney war” phase as we wait for infection to spread. But already there are useful lessons to be learned. The first is about the fragility of supply chains. If humanity survives for another century or more, one of the things that will puzzle future historians is how we failed to notice that we were building an entire civilisation on top of logistical systems of unbelievable complexity and vulnerability. We are finally beginning to realise that while “just in time” production and delivery systems may be good at reducing overheads, they are also only as strong as their weakest links. And an overwhelming number of those links are in China and points further east. If you doubt that, just visit an Apple store and ask to buy a pair of the company’s fancy new earbuds. And chains like this do not degrade gracefully: they can fail suddenly and without warning.   Related: Coronavirus: Google leads tech charge to work from home    We’re also learning more in this unfolding crisis about the terminal malignancy of social media. On 19 February, a group of 27 public-health specialists published a letter in the Lancet expressing their concern that “the rapid, open, and transparent sharing of data on this outbreak is now being threatened by rumours and misinformation around its origins. We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that Covid-19 does not have a natural origin.” Among the posts providing the “user engagement” that social media platforms prize are stories claiming that the virus was created by the CIA, and that it was bioengineered by the Wuhan Institute for Virology, or that a lab worker was infected while handling a bat and then transmitted the disease to others outside the lab. Finally, isn’t it interesting how we have heard nothing recently from Michael Gove about how tired the public is of hearing from experts? Miming seriousness about the coronavirus threat while being flanked by two real, grownup experts – people who actually know what they’re doing – must have been a salutary experience for Boris Johnson. Wouldn’t it be nice if as a result of this crisis we rediscovered how important it is to be governed by people who know what they’re doing.

143,health,"UK woman, 21, with no health issues dies from Covid-19, family say","The family of a 21-year-old woman from Buckinghamshire have said she has died from coronavirus, which if confirmed would make her the youngest victim of the disease in the UK so far. 
Chloe Middleton, from High Wycombe, died from the virus on 21 March, according to her mother and aunt. Health officials have not confirmed the death or its cause.  
Her aunt said Middleton had no underlying health issues and the family said her death showed how dangerous the disease was. 
 
  
  
   
    
    Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:
    
     a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back
     a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly
    
    NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;stay at home for at least 7 days.
    If you live with other people,&nbsp;they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.
    After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.&nbsp;Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.
    If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.
    If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.
    After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.
    If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.
    If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.
    Staying at home means you should:
    
     not go to work, school or public areas
     not use public transport or taxis
     not have visitors, such as friends and family, in your home
     not go out to buy food or collect medicine – order them by phone or online, or ask someone else to drop them off at your home
    
    You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.

Writing on Facebook, her mother, Diane Middleton, said: “To all the people out there that thinks it’s just a virus please think again. Speaking from a personal experience this so-called virus has taken the life of my 21-year-old daughter.” 
And her aunt, Emily Mistry wrote: “My beautiful, kind hearted 21 year old niece (Chloe) has passed away from Covid-19. She had no underlying health issues.” 
She added: “My loved ones are going through the most unimaginable pain, we are shattered beyond belief. The reality of this virus is only just unfolding before our very eyes. Please, please adhere to government guidelines.” 
On Sunday the NHS suggested an 18-year-old male had died from coronavirus, but it has since emerged that the teenager had tested positive for the disease in a hospital in Coventry but died from an unrelated condition. 
On Tuesday the NHS announced 87 more people had died from the disease in the UK in the biggest daily rise to date. They included a 33-year-old. 
The UK’s figures do not include Britons who have died overseas. The latest British victim abroad was the UK’s deputy ambassador to Hungary, Steven Dick, who died in hospital in Budapest on Tuesday.

144,health,Oman readies baroque succession process as sultan's health worsens,"Elaborate discussions are under way in the Omani court about a potential successor to Sultan Qaboos bin Said, who has ruled the Arab nation for nearly 50 years but whose longterm illness has been worsening. The succession process involves the opening of sealed letters in the court in Muscat identifying the sultan’s choice of successor, if the court cannot agree among itself. The sultan, one of the mainstays of Middle East politics for the past four decades, returned a week ago from Belgium where his treatment for a reoccurrence of cancer of the colon he has suffered from for four years was cut short. He had been expected to stay until the end of January. A former British protectorate in the Arabian Peninsula, Oman has been ruled by Qaboos ever since a bloodless coup in 1970 enacted with the help of Britain. He has travelled abroad for medical reasons at least twice since 2014. Qaboos has no children and has not publicly appointed a successor but he secretly recorded his choice in a sealed envelope addressed to the royal family council. The Al Said dynasty has ruled Oman since the mid-18th century. Article 6 of the sultanate’s basic law says the royal family should choose a new sultan within three days of the position falling vacant. Should they fail to reach an agreement, the nation’s defence council, the head of the supreme court and the heads of the two chambers of the consultative council would together open the first envelope containing Qaboos’s choice and then enthrone the person he designated. The purpose of keeping his preferred successor’s name secret is to ensure the authority of the sultan during his lifetime. There are said to be two sealed envelopes, with the second held in a different royal palace in the southern port city of Salalah. Reports circulating at the weekend suggested that the second duplicate letter is being readied to be taken to Muscat in preparation for opening because of the seriousness of the sultan’s condition and the unresolved disputes within the council. Most reports said it will contain the same name and that it exists only in case the first envelope cannot be found or if the first letter needs authenticating. Under Qaboos, who was educated in Britain, Oman has maintained a largely neutral role and acted as a mediator in the region, notably between Iran and the US over the proposed nuclear deal eventually signed in 2015. It has also been the site of talks between Saudi Arabia and the Houthi rebels from Yemen. Oman’s policy of “friend to all and enemy to none” has allowed the country to develop economically. It has not taken sides in the two-year dispute within the Gulf Cooperation Council between the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia on the one hand and Qatar on the other. "
145,health,Indigenous health groups say they are well-equipped to deal with coronavirus,"Indigenous health organisations say they are prepared for the threat the novel coronavirus poses to Indigenous Australians, who are listed as one of the groups most at-risk from Covid-19 by the federal government. There are currently no known cases of the virus among Indigenous Australians, and the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (Naccho) is working with state and federal health authorities to prevent or control any outbreaks. Dawn Casey, the deputy CEO of Naccho, told Guardian Australia that while there were vulnerable people with multiple health issues in Aboriginal communities, the organisation and its members were well-equipped after receiving several briefings from state and federal governments in recent days. The organisation was well-placed to look after its own people, Casey said.   Related: Australian coronavirus cases rise to 42, including doctor and nursing home worker    Research following the 2009 swine flu pandemic showed that Indigenous Australians made up 11% of all identified cases and had a “six-fold death rate compared with non-Indigenous Australians”. The federal government has set up an Indigenous advisory committee to respond to Covid-19, which will meet on Thursday. That will be followed by a meeting next week between Naccho, its state and territory affiliates, public health medical officers, and Aboriginal medical directors from the Kimberley, Cape York and other communities. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said on Tuesday that there was “a real vulnerability” if the virus were to reach small Indigenous communities, but confirmed the government was working closely with those communities to aid preparations. In the Northern Territory, about a quarter of the population is Indigenous. Nearly 80% of those people live in remote or very remote communities, with many speaking English as a second language. NT Health is taking proactive steps to protect those people, said its chief health officer, Dianne Stephens. “NT Health is meeting regularly with external organisations to develop and prevent and if required, manage, a Covid-19 outbreak in remote communities,” Stephens said. “The plan will take into account the unique needs of our remote communities, including the delivery of messages in local languages.” She did not specify whether steps will be taken to allow individuals to self-isolate, if required, in remote communities where household overcrowding is a significant issue. The government’s current advice says that anyone who may have come into contact with the virus should seek accommodation within three hours of major municipalities in the state, and not visit or return to a remote community, even if they live there. While Stephens acknowledged the risk posed by Covid-19 to those who live with chronic conditions, she said that “it must be stressed that most people who have contracted the Covid-19 infection develop only mild to moderate symptoms and do not require hospitalisation”.   Related: Coronavirus: Woolworths moves to ration toilet paper as panic buying empties shelves    In Western Australia, a spokesperson for the health department said that “preparations recognise the greater vulnerability of Aboriginal people”, and that the department was working closely with the Aboriginal Health Council of WA and Aboriginal community-controlled health services. A working group with representatives from remote communities is working to address concerns around self-isolation. The spokesperson didn’t confirm what alternatives were being considered. The department has not specifically developed resources in languages other than English. Instead, it is directing Western Australians to the federal resources – which are available in Farsi and Simplified or Traditional Chinese, but not Indigenous languages. Queensland’s chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, did not give details of how the state’s response was being tailored to Indigenous communities, but said that Indigenous health organisations were part of the planning process. NSW Health and the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council of NSW have hosted a joint webinar for Aboriginal community-controlled health services across the state. NSW Health did not respond to questions about other steps being taken."
146,health,"Don’t bet on vaccine to protect us from Covid-19, says world health expert","Humanity will have to live with the threat of coronavirus “for the foreseeable future” and adapt accordingly because there is no guarantee that a vaccine can be successfully developed, one of the world’s leading experts on the disease has warned. 
The stark message was delivered by David Nabarro, professor of global health at Imperial College, London, and an envoy for the World Health Organisation on Covid-19, as the number of UK hospital deaths from the virus passed 15,000. 
 
  Related: How did Britain get its response to coronavirus so wrong?  
 
A further 888 people were reported on Saturday to have lost their lives – a figure described by communities secretary Robert Jenrick as “extremely sobering” – while the total number who have been infected increased by 5,525 to 114,217. 
The latest figures, which do not include deaths in care homes and in the community, put further pressure on the government amid continuing anger among NHS workers and unions over the lack personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospital and care home staff on the front line. 
In late March the government’s health advisers said that if UK deaths from Coronavirus could be kept below 20,000 by the end of the pandemic, it would be a “good result” for country. But with an estimated 6,000 people having already died in care homes from Covid-19 – a figure not included in Saturday’s official tally – the 20,000 figure is likely already to have been exceeded. 
In an interview with The Observer Nabarro said the public should not assume that a vaccine would definitely be developed soon – and would have to adapt to the ongoing threat. 
“You don’t necessarily develop a vaccine that is safe and effective against every virus. Some viruses are very, very difficult when it comes to vaccine development - so for the foreseeable future, we are going to have to find ways to go about our lives with this virus as a constant threat. 
“That means isolating those who show signs of the disease and also their contacts. Older people will have to be protected. In addition hospital capacity for dealing with cases will have to be ensured. That is going to be the new normal for us all.”

The comments came as the former UK health secretary Jeremy Hunt said the only way forward was for nations to support a new global health system that would mean far more international cooperation between governments on health issues. It would also require richer nations doing more to support the health systems of the world’s poorest countries. 
“I think global health security is going to be on that small but critical list of topics like climate change that we can only solve in partnership with other countries,” Hunt told The Observer. 
In a clear criticism of US President Donald Trump who announced last week he was putting on hold funding to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Hunt added: “Surely the lesson of coronavirus is cure not kill…It certainly does not mean cutting their funding (to the WHO). 
“One of the big lessons from this will be that when it comes to health systems across the world, we are only as strong as the weakest link in the chain. 
“Although China has rightly been criticised for covering up the virus in the early stages the situation would have been whole lot worse if this had started in Africa. International cooperation and supporting health care systems of the poorest countries has to be a top priority in terms of the lessons we need to learn.”

Nabarro’s message is the second grim warning to come from senior ranks of the WHO in the last three days. On Friday, Maria Van Kerkhove, head of WHO’s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, warned that there was no evidence that antibody tests now being developed would show if a person has immunity or is no longer at risk of becoming reinfected by the Covid-19 virus. 
On Saturday it emerged that doctors and nurses treating Covid-19 face shortages of protective full-length gowns for weeks to come, as anger mounts over failures to stockpile them. Gowns were not included in a stockpile list prepared for a potential flu pandemic. 
After The Guardian revealed new guidance from Public Health England which instructs healthcare workers to re-use disposable equipment, the GMB, which represents NHS and ambulance staff, said support was “draining away” from Health Secretary, Matt Hancock.

Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers which represents many trusts, told the Observer: “We are in a situation where we think this [issue] will last a couple of weeks, which probably does just take us to May. There is a shortage of gowns which is affecting some trusts, but not all. Some have none, and are using the alternatives.” 
The government will attempt to gain control of the mounting PPE concerns by appointing Paul Deighton, chief executive of the London Olympics organising committee, to lead efforts to produce equipment in Britain. 
Ministers also announced another £1.6bn cash injection to local councils as they attempt to stem a spiralling crisis in social care that is pushing some care providers into the red. Some have been paying inflated prices for commercial protective equipment."
147,health,Millions of Americans are about to lose their health insurance in a pandemic,"The tragic effects of our battle with the novel coronavirus are seemingly endless. But arguably the most mind-blowing is this: the very pandemic that threatens to infect and kill millions is simultaneously causing many to also lose their health coverage at their gravest time of need. Here’s how: the virus has caused a public health crisis so severe that people have been forced to stay home, causing businesses to shutter and lay off workers. And with roughly half of Americans getting their health insurance from their employer, these layoffs mean not only losing their income but also their medical coverage. In other words, just as our need for medical care skyrockets in the face of a global pandemic, fewer will have health insurance or be able to afford it. According to one recent report, the cost of treatment for Covid-19 can run around $35,000. As the patient in the report exclaimed: “I was pretty sticker-shocked. I personally don’t know anybody who has that kind of money.” So, how did we get to such a dire place? Many will sadly lose their jobs over the coming weeks – with one estimate projecting as many as 30%. And as they do, Americans are about to learn something horrifying: how irrational and irresponsible it is for so many to be dependent on employers for health insurance. Take it from me. I’m a former health insurance executive who once profited from this system. It’s time for it to stop. America needs to finally get out of the business of linking health coverage to job status. Even in better times, this arrangement was a bad idea from a health perspective. Most Americans whose families depend on their employers for coverage are just a layoff away from being uninsured. And now, when many businesses are shutting down and considering layoffs, it’s a public health disaster. Across the country we’re seeing reports of layoffs in almost all industries. As we approach a global recession, some analysts suggest that a million or more US workers will lose their jobs in April alone. Consider what this means for health care in this country. We’ve seen this before. During the last big recession, researchers at Cornell University found that 9.3 million Americans lost their health insurance between 2007 and 2009. Why? As people lost work, their employer-provided insurance went away. During this time, roughly six in 10 Americans who lost their jobs became uninsured. And this problem compounds itself. If the reason you lost your health insurance is that you no longer have steady employment, how are you now going to be able to afford monthly premiums for some other private health care plan? This problem becomes particularly acute when you consider that premiums for health plans sold on exchanges are projected to soar, as well, due to “unexpected Covid-19 costs”. It’s worth noting that even in good times, the employer-based model fails to cover enough of us, with the number of Americans covered through an employer steadily dropping in general. Since 1999, the percentage of those with job-based coverage has declined by nine points. And it most certainly will drop like a rock in the coming weeks and months. It’s now clear that this system cannot handle our current reality. With so many Americans sadly on the verge of unemployment, the number that will lose health coverage will be crushing. As we rebuild our country’s economic base and reimagine the roles various industries play in our new future, we must also begin a difficult conversation about health care. If we’re dependent on jobs in order to have it, a lot of us will be left out in the cold. And at a time in our nation’s history where more will need quality care than ever before, the human cost will simply be too much to bear.

148,health,Retired health workers urged to return as US coronavirus cases set to spike,"Government officials across the US are calling on retired health workers to come back to work amid the coronavirus pandemic, expecting the current workforce of health workers to be overwhelmed and many to fall ill themselves.   Related: A nurse's coronavirus journal: 'Rumors abound, stories fry our nerves'    The call for retired workers and other qualified medical professionals to help frontline staff underscores the desperate measures officials expect will be needed to care for a surge in ill patients, as older workers themselves will be much more susceptible to complications and death from Covid-19. New York’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, called on retired doctors to volunteer last week, with 1,000 workers responding in one day. Some states are working to quickly re-certify health professionals’ expired licenses. Governor JB Pritzker of Illinois cut red tape to allow doctors and nurses to renew expired licenses.

I could imagine being drafted to go back to the hospital if we have a lot of ventilator patients,” he said. He said he would say yes to such a request.

In New York, which has fast become a global hotspot, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday that projections for needed hospital beds had sharply increased as the number of cases rises more quickly than predicted. Now, state officials expect 140,000 patients will need hospital beds, 30,000 higher than previous projections. New York currently has about 55,000 hospital beds. “A bed without staff is virtually useless,” said Cuomo. “I will turn this state upside down to get the number of beds we need. But we need the staff for those beds.” He continued, “We’re calling and contacting all retirees in the healthcare field, we’re calling all professionals in the healthcare fields, whether or not they work in a hospital, they can work at an insurance company, a clinic, whatever, but we want to enlist as many staff as we can.” Already, 40,000 health professionals have volunteered to act as a “surge health force”. Among them, are 2,400 nurse practitioners, 2,200 doctors have volunteered to help in the crisis. Another 6,000 mental health professionals are providing free therapy. The problem of keeping hospitals, clinics and nursing homes staffed during the crisis is underscored by the very nature of the disease the world is fighting. In Wuhan, China, the likelihood of infection among medical workers was more than three times as high as the general population. The coronavirus is highly contagious, and spreads through droplets of mucus and saliva, leaving health workers – many of whom are caring for patients without the appropriate protective equipment – at risk.

Already, healthcare workers have begun to get sick. Two emergency room doctors in New Jersey and Washington state were put in critical care last week.

A retired emergency department doctor in Illinois said he has been monitoring the situation for months, and wondering when to step in. “I’ve been trying to figure out how I can contribute since January when this all started,” Dr Scott Altman told local news station WGN. “It was very clear we were going to need to respond quickly and forcefully.”"
149,health,Border Force blames NSW Health for letting Ruby Princess dock without coronavirus checks,"Australian Border Force has blamed New South Wales Health for giving the Ruby Princess the green light to dock in Sydney, saying it was state authorities who decided not to send any health officers to the ship to check passengers for Covid-19. In a forthright press conference, the force’s commissioner, Michael Outram, said ABF’s responsibilities for border control did not extend to health checks. But the NSW government is still insisting it was federal authorities who categorised the cruise ship carrying 2,700 people as “low risk”, resulting in the release of a major wave of 133 infections in the Australian community. In what is proving a catastrophe amid efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19 in Australia, politicians have expressed outrage that the system failed to isolate the Ruby Princess passengers and crew.   Related: Anatomy of a coronavirus disaster: how 2,700 people were let off the Ruby Princess cruise ship by mistake    When it docked in Sydney on 19 March, three passengers and one crew member were displaying flu-like symptoms and had been swabbed. One was taken by ambulance to hospital and subsequently died of Covid-19. But passengers were permitted to disembark and make their way home, including flying overseas, with warnings to self-isolate for 14 days. The Australian reported on Wednesday that the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, had told a gathering of state colleagues that ABF officials had erroneously advised NSW Health that the ship was low risk. At a press conference on Wednesday, Berejiklian said stopping transmission was a joint responsibility. “Every single agency needs to take responsibility for our borders,” she said. “Whether it’s a ship at a port, whether it’s a planeload of people coming in from overseas. We’re still having thousands of people coming in on planes every single day. “All authorities have to step up, including NSW Health, including all the other authorities involved. “What is really imperative at this time, we realised, is strong communication between authorities and everybody stepping up.” The state’s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said New Zealand had checked the ship in Wellington and found no cases of Covid-19. But once NSW authorities had recognised that coronavirus was on the ship they had followed up on all of the passengers. She said there was “no action that NSW Health could have taken to prevent those people acquiring the disease”, as they had acquired it on the ship. She stressed that all passengers had been asked to self-isolate and that any cases identified were being “ringfenced”. Most people began showing symptoms on the day of disembarkation and in subsequent days, she said, and NSW Health were working incredibly hard to limit onward transmission. “If we had had any suspicion, we would have deployed health teams,” Chant said. The department had contingency plans in place if an outbreak were identified. “Of course, with hindsight, we would have acted differently, had we known we had a Covid-positive cruise ship.” Chant said she would look into reports that passengers were not given instructions to self-isolate when they disembarked, noting that this was an ABF responsibility as its officers processed passengers. She defended allowing overseas passengers to fly home, as this was part of the agreed protocol to send them into self-isolation at home. Tracing of people sitting in rows around infected passengers was being conducted, she said. A week earlier Scott Morrison announced a 30-day ban on foreign cruise ships docking in Australia but the government made an exemption for four already on their way, including the Ruby Princess. Three of these ships have subsequently been found to be carrying people infected with Covid-19. Passengers were permitted to disembark with the standard advice that they should self-isolate for 14 days when they reached home. The federal government has also issued new biosecurity orders. Outram provided what he said was the timeline of interactions between the ship and NSW Health. He said ABF’s responsibilities were confined to checking passports and ensuring that customs regulations were complied with, while the federal Department of Agriculture was responsible for biosecurity checks. “On the 17 March, 2020, NSW Health requested the following information from the Ruby Princess’s senior doctor: estimates of arrival into Sydney, a log of details of passengers and crew presenting with fever or acute respiratory symptoms or both, travel histories, and whether tests were conducted and the results,” Outram said. “On March 18, at 9.39am the senior doctor on the Ruby Princess notified the health department with the following: they had collected viral swabs for a few cases of febrile influenza, negative test, and that those people had been isolated. They also requested a transfer for other passengers who had unrelated illnesses.” “On March 18 2020, at 5.17pm, they stated: ‘The NSW Health panel assessed the Ruby Princess as not requiring onboard health assessment in Sydney.’”   Related: Ruby Princess coronavirus cases could 'double or triple' in next few days, expert says    He said NSW Health had requested that Ruby Princess send the 15 samples to a NSW Health lab for Covid-19 testing and to attach lab forms as required. “NSW Health stated to the Ruby Princess, ‘You are free to disembark tomorrow. However, in accordance with the Australian government guidance, all passengers must go into self-isolation for 14 days,’” Outram said. He went on to say that on 18 March the Department of Agriculture was informed through Ruby Princess that a risk assessment had been conducted and that the ship was considered “low risk”. This is consistent with NSW Health’s version of events. “NSW Health decided not to board the vessel and attend, and that they had also given clearance for all passengers to disembark the vessel,” Outram said. “That red light has just gone green. So, the vessel came into port on March 19.  “They felt the vessel was low risk and there was no need to attend the vessel, but our six officers wore masks and gloves nonetheless.” He said protocols required any vessel coming into Australia’s waters from overseas to provide 96 hours’ notice for any disease. He said this had worked well for ships docking in Victoria and Western Australia, which had sent state health authorities to board them. Labor’s spokeswoman on immigration, Kristina Keneally, said the Ruby Princess fiasco would prove to be a tipping point in Covid-19’s spread in Australia. “We have now 133 passengers and counting from the Ruby Princess cruise ship that have tested positive for coronavirus,” she said. “The Ruby Princess cruise ship coronavirus cases account for 10% of the cases in NSW. And, quite tragically, there has already been one death.” This was despite the prime minister announcing there would be no more cruise ships arriving in Australia, she said. “They went into taxis and public transport, they interacted with friends and neighbours, they went to shops, they were allowed to travel across the country,” she said. “It is gobsmacking that we are in this circumstance today. We need to ask, we need to demand to know how this happened and we need to ensure it does not happen again. The Australian government needs to get on top of this situation very quickly.”"
150,health,Australian government experts at odds with health department over using hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus,"The government’s expert panel on disease control has recommended against the use of a controversial anti-malarial drug, hydroxychloroquine, for treating coronavirus, directly contradicting the federal health department, which has told doctors they can prescribe it for patients. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee – the peak body that manages health emergencies – said experimental use of medications such as hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 prevention and treatment was not recommended, and should only be prescribed as part of a clinical trial. “Appropriate dosage of medications for use in Covid-19 are not yet determined, and there is concern that if used inappropriately, off-label use of medications may cause toxicity and lead to adverse patient outcomes,” the latest AHPPC advice on use of the drugs for Covid-19 says. “Due to safety concerns, and the unknown effects of prescribing these medications for off-label usage, such as for Covid-19 infection, there are no current recommendations to treat patients with mild to moderate Covid-19 illness.”     Sign up for Guardian Australia’s daily coronavirus email newsletter   But the Department of Health confirmed on Wednesday that as well as being used in clinical trials, the drugs may be given “in a controlled environment in the treatment of severely ill patients in hospital”. It comes as one of the institutions being supported by the government to run clinical trials of the drug for Covid-19 treatment, the Royal Brisbane Women’s Hospital Foundation, has refused to answer questions from Guardian Australia about the trial and wrongful descriptions of the drug by a professor leading the trial as a “cure”. After initially agreeing to answer questions, a foundation spokeswoman has not returned emails or responded to calls. The foundation trial has received favourable coverage from Channel Seven. The broadcaster has not responded to questions from Guardian Australia. Australian virologists and doctors have warned that hydroxychloroquine can cause severe and even life-threatening side-effects, and have cautioned against using it for conditions for which it has not been tested. It is a proven treatment for malaria and for some autoimmune conditions. Studies on its efficacy as a Covid-19 preventative or treatment are mixed. Much of the focus on the drug came after a small French study, which has since been widely disputed and been found to have omitted data containing spurious results. A small study from China found no benefit to chloroquine being given to Covid-19 patients.   Related: Trump touts hydroxychloroquine as a cure for Covid-19. Don't believe the hype    Hydroxychloroquine has also caused division within the White House, Axios reported, after the US president, Donald Trump, hyped it as a “game changer” in treating the virus. The White House infectious disease expert warned Trump that evidence for the drug was only anecdotal and far from proven. Meanwhile, a hospital in France has stopped administering the drug to Covid-19 patients owing to cardiac side-effects. On Saturday Guardian Australia revealed that a delegate of the health minister, Greg Hunt, had exempted hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, Remdesivir, Lopinavir and Ritonavir from a requirement to be listed on the Australian register of therapeutic goods, which is generally the only way medicine can be lawfully supplied in Australia. The exemptions specified that the medications “must only be supplied in Australia for the prevention, treatment or alleviation of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) following advice from the Australian government department of health”. In a press conference on Wednesday Hunt was asked by Guardian Australia whether he was concerned about the drugs being used off-label. “The AHPPC gave very wise advice on the use of different medicines and they were very clear about the situation about off-label use, but also talked about appropriateness of clinical trials,” he said. Hunt said clinical trials were “entirely within the appropriate medical conduct”, but declined to offer a view about off-label usage. “I’ll let medical advisers provide the medical advice, that’s the appropriate balance,” he said."
151,health,"Australia's economic victims of coronavirus, just like the health victims, need help now","Most people agree we should do all we can to help those who – through no fault of their own – contract Covid-19. The government is, rightly, about to spend billions of dollars on health services to help those who need it. No one expects people to get through coronavirus on their own. But when it comes to the hundreds of thousands of people who are about to lose their jobs because of Covid-19, our public policy response is not nearly so generous. The median full-time wage in Australia is $68,000 a year. A person who is laid off from their job will land in a Newstart safety net of almost $14,500 a year. How many weeks could you pay for food, rent, mortgage or car payments on $280 a week?   Related: Welfare recipients on cashless debit card will have $750 stimulus payment quarantined    For decades, governments have justified the rations we provide to the unemployed, with claims such as: 1. “Newstart isn’t like the age pension, because people don’t have to live on it for long.” Leaving aside the fact that the average bout of unemployment in Australia lasts more than 10 months, there is no doubt that over the next six months a wave of newly unemployed people will be queuing up for Newstart. And the more people that enter the ranks of the unemployed, the longer the average bout of unemployment will last. 2. “If Newstart would be ‘too generous’, people would have no incentive to look for work.” Again, leaving aside the fact there was never any strong evidence that a lack of effort or searching (as opposed to a shortage of jobs) was the cause of unemployment, surely, no one believes that an airline worker who gets stood down from their $80,000 per year job needs any more incentive to return to work than their employer allowing them to. But just as there’s no reason to lay blame on people who need intensive care because they’ve contracted Covid-19, there is absolutely no reason to blame the retail workers, tourism workers or teachers who are likely to find themselves without an income in the coming weeks. And it’s hard to imagine why we wouldn’t help them. Another argument for not helping the unemployed is that individuals should have prepared themselves for a “rainy day”. This argument was put most gratuitously by the federal attorney general, Christian Porter, who suggested casual workers – around 40%  of whom are below 25 years old – should have “already made provisions” for an event like being told they can’t work for 14 days because of a global health pandemic. No wonder people think the government is out of touch.   Related: Christian Porter doesn’t understand insecure work can be scarier than coronavirus | Van Badham    But luckily for the unemployed, the once-fiscally conservative Coalition are desperately looking for new things to spend money on so they can prevent GDP, and their polling numbers, crashing too badly. There are currently around 734,000 people on Newstart. And while far from generous, the age pension is a full 54% higher than Newstart, at $430.30 per week. If we boosted the income of those on Newstart by the $10,000 difference between their payment and the age pension, the cost over 12 months would only be around $7.3bn. But of course we shouldn’t stop with the unemployed. For the course of this crisis we should boost the weekly incomes of all beneficiaries, all of whom are among the lower state income earners, and all of whom will struggle with less casual work and the higher costs for staples. The government has already announced its first $17.6bn stimulus package and is reportedly working on its second. There might even be a third and fourth round of stimulus, as the length of this pandemic makes itself apparent. Given the obvious needs of those with the least work and on the lowest incomes, and given the government’s need to pump money into the economy, there is literally no argument against boosting Newstart payments other than “they don’t deserve it”. But no one “deserves” to get Covid-19. And no one deserves to lose their job or stay stuck in unemployment because of Covid-19 either. Australia is one of the richest countries in the world. While we have high levels of household debt we have very low levels of public debt. State and federal governments will likely borrow more than $100bn over the course of this health crisis. That’s a very good thing. Decades of political sloganeering have convinced large sections of the media, and of the population, that government borrowing is wasteful, a burden on future generations, or both. But – as all of the media and all of the population are about to learn – almost no economists or politicians actually believe that. Allegedly there are no atheists in a foxhole, and history tells us that everyone becomes a Keynesian when they are tasked with avoiding a recession. Just as borrowing money to buy a house or get a uni degree makes sense because the future benefits are greater than the interest costs, borrowing money to avoid a recession and save tens of thousands of jobs can set Australia up for decades. It’s a pity it takes a pandemic to drive such honesty into our public debate, but we should take advantage of the honesty nonetheless.   Related: Australian airline industry to receive $715m rescue package    Whether it’s pumping tens of billions of dollars into the economy via Kevin Rudd’s $950 cheques to nearly everyone or through Scott Morrison’s $750 cheques to the unemployed and age pensioners, boosting benefits is a highly effective way to keep money going through cash registers, and in turn, keep people in their jobs. Think of the “cash splash” element of economic stimulus as buying a lower rate of unemployment. Virtually all economists think it’s a bargain. But the stimulus will need to be much bigger and last much longer than one-off cheques. That’s why the government should increase weekly payments for more Australians, and think about all of the projects we can start building today that will serve us well into the future. Just as a lot of people being stuck at home will bring forward some household painting, gardening and minor repairs, so too should governments use “idle time” and record low interest rates to bring forward housing, energy and transport projects. We don’t need to choose between a cash splash or big long run projects. The economy needs both, now. But more importantly, the economic victims of Covid-19 – just like the health victims in intensive care – need help, now. Offering to help later is the same as not offering to help at all. • Richard Denniss is chief economist at the Australia Institute"
152,health,Police and health officials to get powers to detain under UK coronavirus bill,"Police, public health and immigration officers will be able to detain people suspected of having Covid-19 and exact £1,000 fines for refusing tests under emergency powers rolled out by the UK government. 
The guidance detailed in the coronavirus bill allows public health officers to order someone believed to be infected to undergo screening and testing within 14 days. They will be required to provide biological samples and disclose their travel history. 
Alongside the police, they will also have the power to force potentially infected people to isolate, restrict their travel and activities and contact with other people. 
Immigration officers and police will also be handed powers to send people for screening and testing and hold them for a period of time before a public health officer can be consulted. 
These measures will be enforced and fines exacted only if there is a risk of a serious and imminent threat to public health. 
This would include anyone who absconds while being moved to be tested, providing false information or obstructing someone trying to implement the restrictions. 
 
  
  
   default
  
  
 
The bill states: “We assume the vast majority of people will comply with relevant public health advice. The policy aim of these provisions is to ensure that proportionate measures can be enforced if and when necessary. 
“The proposals will provide public health officers, constables and (in some circumstances) immigration officers with the means to enforce sensible public health restrictions, including returning people to places that they have been required to stay.” 
The bill also gives the government stronger powers to intervene if it suspects anyone is disrupting the distribution of food. 
Industry insiders said new clauses will give ministers the power to demand information at short notice if they suspect food has been acquired on the black market. 
Funeral directors will be able to register deaths and cause of death certificates to registrars electronically and will also “remove need for second confirmatory medical certificate in order for cremation to take place”. 
While Labour has called for the powers to be reviewed every six months, the bill instead only requires the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to prepare a report on its operation every two months, with a motion put before parliament after every sixth report – ie once a year. 
This motion would be a so-called motion in neutral terms, put before the Commons and Lords, saying that MPs and peers had considered the report. Such motions are not usually amendable. 
Before the emergency powers were proposed by the government on Thursday, a cross-party group of MPs and peers warned that any measures it takes to curb the spread of coronavirus must not breach human rights provisions. 
The intervention by parliament’s joint committee on human rights comes after Jeremy Corbyn wrote to Boris Johnson asking that the powers in the new coronavirus bill, which will last for two years, are reviewed every six months. 
Opposition parties are not expected to seek votes on the emergency legislation, which is expected to complete all stages of the Commons on Monday, and then pass through the Lords on Wednesday and Thursday. 
However, both party leaderships and MPs are lobbying hard to try to ensure safeguards, with the new powers set to include the potential ability of police to ban all gatherings, and to detain people with the virus and move them to quarantine. 
In a letter to Johnson, Corbyn said people understood the need for temporary restrictions. He added: “But given how far-reaching these are proposed to be, people’s elected representatives must be able to decide whether to renew the legislation at least every six months, up to its expiration after two years.” 
The human rights committee has published a 12-page interim report into potential civil liberties issues that could arise because of the powers in the legislation. 
It stresses that all measures should comply with the UK’s obligations under both the UN and European conventions on human rights.  
Harriet Harman, the Labour MP who chairs the human rights committee, said: “Times of national crisis call for strong and decisive leadership. However, at this time, it is also vitally important that checks and balances are in place to ensure that human rights are not disregarded, and that people remain fully protected under the law. 
“The committee will be thoroughly scrutinising the measures taken and any proposed legislation.”"
153,health,"The best health foods? Soup, garlic and cake","Some people are brilliant when their loved ones are ill, and know instinctively what face to make, when to chat, when to be quiet, when to make tea, when to plump a pillow and so forth. Others are terrible, instinctively avoidant, brusque and awkward. They need to ask themselves what they’re so afraid of. But in the meantime, a great way to show you care while you build your genuinely caring personality is to do convalescent cookery. Soup is so famously a restorative that scientists with a bit of downtime often try to show the mechanism. This week, a study found four traditional broths that were protective against malaria, although there was no particular ingredient common to all four. The active property has yet to be identified, which is the fancy way of saying “we have no idea why”. It is unlikely, however, that you’re tending to someone with malaria. More probably, they have a cold (although my Mr currently has lockjaw, and if you’re wondering what to feed someone who can’t open his mouth, it is of course more soup). The seminal 2000 study on the benefits of chicken soup, published in the medical journal Chest, used the Lithuanian recipe of its author’s grandmother. It found that the soup inhibited the migration of neutrophils, which are the commonest white blood cells fighting infection, and those responsible for all the snot and whatnot. Again, they could not figure out the soup might have this action, nor why it might have a beneficial effect on the functioning of cilia – the tiny nose hairs that block infective agents. Like so much that emanates from a grandmother, you just have to take this stuff on trust. A surprising newcomer to the premier league of curative ingredients is fennel. Again, the scientific case for it has yet to be made, but it’s often found to be soothing for the digestion, good for colic and for period pains – hypothetically because it mimics the effects of oestrogen. The best fennel soup of all time is from Marimar Torres’s The Catalan Country Kitchen, and involves sweating half a kilo of the vegetable down to complete surrender with some garlic and two onions, adding chicken stock and whizzing it up.   Related: Food nourishes mind and body. So let’s enjoy eating | Ruby Tandoh    Garlic, incidentally, cures everything, being an anti-inflammatory, so good for arthritis, depression, gout, the works. My mother once read that you could apply it directly to get rid of a verruca, which she did. But it got into her bloodstream and made her smell so profoundly of garlic that she thought we had a gas leak and actually called British Gas. That is a 100% true story. “Bone broth”, which is what millennials call stock, is beneficial mainly because it’s high in protein, for which you have a particular need if you have broken a bone. There will come a time when the patient doesn’t want any more soup, but still cannot manage much in the way of chewing. The only thing for it then is porridge, which doesn’t say “I care” so much as: “If push comes to shove, I would like you to remain alive.” Once recuperation is under way, protein is the main priority: people understand this when they’re doing a lot of sport, but that knowledge somehow vanishes when actual recovery replaces workout recovery. The problem is that a lot of high-protein foods are also quite high effort - you have to chew them, they smell powerfully and they often involve sauce, which is the last thing you want in a sick bed. Hospitals get a bad rap for the nutritional quality of the food they serve, but the really striking thing if you’re around at mealtimes is how oppressive it is, even when you’re not ill, that sudden gust of cod mornay and spaghetti bolognese and sponge pudding.   Related: Kitchen trouble: when chefs get sick – and how they cure themselves    With apologies in advance, because I’ve often claimed, on environmental grounds, never to eat beef, last night I made crab (omega 3 fatty acids are also good for inflammation, which is a partial source of the low mood that often follows prolonged illness) and then steak tartare, which is a serious hit of protein masquerading as a salad. If someone is suffering a long-term terminal illness, simply having bad days and better days, and their appetite is never very strong, you had just better hope they like cheese. A final word for cake: even people with no sweet tooth at all will eat a bit of cake when they’re ill, and people who love cake love it more. Keep it very nursery and simple. Avoid chocolate, because you want it the colour of Victoria sponge. Adding autumn fruits gives it a more wholesome aspect and you will get rid of it even faster. I shifted two entire plum cakes at the weekend, with just the lockjaw and a cold in the house (Diane Henry’s recipe is the best) and have never felt more like a high-functioning Florence Nightingale."
154,health,"Inequalities of US health system put coronavirus fight at risk, experts say","The US health agency overseeing coronavirus has told Americans that to curb the inevitable spread of the respiratory illness, they only need to take simple steps: wash your hands, stay home from work if you feel sick and speak to a doctor if you have symptoms of the disease. But in the US healthcare system, things are never as simple as they seem. From the cost of healthcare to the lack of guaranteed paid sick days in the US, experts say containing the coronavirus requires systemic change beyond more people washing their hands. “For many Americans who have insurance and have a good job with an understanding employer, and I’m not an expert on the labor market, those recommendations are plausible,” David Blumenthal, president of the global health thinktank the Commonwealth Fund, told the Guardian. “They are not necessarily workable for people who have no health insurance or poor health insurance – so that’s about a fifth of the American population.” The head of immunization at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Nancy Messonnier, said on Tuesday that containing coronavirus was a priority because there is no vaccine or medicine to prevent and treat it.   Related: What are super-spreaders and how are they transmitting coronavirus?    To do this, she said businesses should consider replacing in-person meetings with telework. She recommended school authorities consider ways to limit face-to-face contact, such as using internet-based learning or even closing schools. People experiencing respiratory illness are advised to seek medical help early. But Americans, particularly those with expensive health insurance plans or no health insurance at all, are known to avoid medical help because of the cost. More Americans were afraid of paying for healthcare if they became seriously ill (40%) than were afraid of getting seriously ill (33%), according to a 2018 poll by the University of Chicago and the West Health Institute. The study also found that in one year, more than once, about 40% of Americans skipped a medical test or treatment and 44% didn’t go to the doctor when they were sick or injured. “People with acute illness of all kinds postpone healthcare when they lack health insurance or have high deductibles,” Blumenthal said. “And there’s no reason to expect people with symptoms of an upper respiratory infection would not do the same when coronavirus might present with a cough, with a low-grade fever, but not a completely debilitating illness.” In countries with universal healthcare, people do not always go to the doctor when they are sick. But the deterrent is never the threat of high medical bills. “This is almost a uniquely American problem when it comes to the developed world,” Blumenthal said. One American who usually skipped visits to the doctor, Osmel Martinez Azcue, decided to get tested when he developed flu-like symptoms after returning from China in January. While he would normally just go to a drugstore and buy medicine, he went to a hospital out of concern for his community. Azcue told the Miami Herald he had a limited insurance plan so he attempted to keep the testing to a minimum, fearing the cost of the CT scan clinicians recommended. After doing smaller, less expensive tests, doctors told him he had the flu, not coronavirus. He was charged $3,270. After the hospital was contacted by the Miami Herald, they said he was responsible for $1,400 of the bill. “How can they expect normal citizens to contribute to eliminating the potential risk of person-to-person spread if hospitals are waiting to charge us $3,270 for a simple blood test and a nasal swab?” he said. Staying home when sick leave isn’t guaranteed To contain coronavirus, the CDC emphasized how important it would be to avoid crowds, work from home and even self-quarantine. In the only wealthy country in the world which does not require employers to give workers paid sick days, that guidance is difficult to follow. At least three in 10 workers did not take time off from work when sick with the H1N1 swine flu in 2009, according to a paper by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. The paper said this led up to seven million additional infections and may have extended the outbreak. “There’s a lot of infrastructure that needs to happen before the CDC’s recommendations can be taken seriously,” said Carol Joyner, director of the Labor Project for Working Families, a not-for-profit which advocates for better family workplace policies. For people in public-facing, low-wage jobs, staying home from work is rarely an option. The average wage of workers without paid sick leave is $10 per hour, according to a 2012 Center for American Progress report. The report said that while 38% of private-sector workers lack even one paid sick day, the percentage is much lower for part-time workers, with 73% lacking access. These workers are likely to include people who work with the public, such as food servers and bus drivers, or people who work with vulnerable populations, such as assisted-living home staff and people who work in childcare. These are also jobs where telecommuting, which the CDC warned might be needed as the coronavirus outbreak spreads, isn’t an option. “It will be a population of people who earn lower wages, who are often people of color, who are often women, who will be hardest hit by the coronavirus,” said Joyner. These are also the groups studies show over and over again have the worst access to affordable health insurance and to paid family and medical leave. A 2014 CDC study found one in five food service workers said they worked at least once in the previous year while sick with vomiting or diarrhea. These workers cited fear of job loss and not wanting to leave co-workers short-staffed as significant factors in their decision to go to work ill. Karen Scott, a PhD student in management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, warned in an article for the Conversation that when sick employees head into work “a manageable health crisis can spiral out of control”. Scott advised consumers to ask about paid sick leave policies at their favorite restaurants, which could affect company culture. There is also legislation moving to create national paid family and medical leave insurance called the Family Act, and the Healthy Families Act to set a baseline of seven paid sick days each year.   Related: 'I suffer through it': how US workers cope without paid sick leave    That said, the situation isn’t much better for workers who do have paid leave. Workplace culture in the US does not support taking sick days, even when they are needed. An October 2019 study from the global staffing firm Accountemps found 90% of professionals have gone to work with cold or flu symptoms. Private sector workers who do have sick days are given an average of seven days of paid sick leave per year, whether they have been at a company for one, five or 10 years, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. At 20 years of service, the average bumps up to eight paid sick days. This is half the amount of time recommended for a self-quarantine. Even the most basic recommendation: to wash your hands more frequently with soap and water, was challenged by the writer Talia Jane on Twitter. “‘Wash your hands’ is great advice to folks who don’t engage with hundreds of people a day,” she said. “I can’t leave the floor to wash my hands after each customer whose money and food I touched while bagging their groceries. We also can’t wear gloves or masks.”"
155,health,The ‘forever chemicals’ fueling a public health crisis in drinking water,"In 2002, the French multinational Saint-Gobain boosted production of chemically weatherproofed fabrics that it produced in its Merrimack, New Hampshire, plant. Soon after, serious health problems began hitting residents living near the facility. The Merrimack Citizens for Clean Water (MCCW) advocacy group says people there suffer from high levels of cancer, cardiovascular issues, autoimmune disorders, kidney disease and developmental disorders. That includes an alarming number of children facing rare and aggressive cancers, said MCCW’s Laurene Allen, who lives in the city of about 30,000 that sits an hour north of Boston.   Related: Why you need to know about PFAS, the chemicals in pizza boxes and rainwear    Residents suspected Teflon and other PFAS used in Sant-Gobain’s fabrics were to blame, and testing appears to confirm that: officials have identified 34 PFAS in concentrations as high as 70,000 parts per trillion (ppt) throughout a 65-mile area around the plant. New Hampshire’s groundwater limit is 12ppt. MCCW has been pushing for Saint-Gobain to fund a clean-up, but Allen said the state and company’s responses have been inadequate. The situation, she added, amounts to “insanity”. “Over and over people are asking: ‘Why was this allowed to happen?’ ‘Why does it continue to happen?’” Allen said. But similar fights are now playing out around America as residents, environmental groups and officials at all levels are confronted with a grim and ever-growing public health crisis fueled by PFAS, known as “forever chemicals” for their immense longevity in the environment. Throughout 2019 and now in 2020, the staggering scope of the new American health crisis has come sharply into focus. About 700 PFAS-contaminated sites have been identified nationwide, while more than 110 million people may now be drinking contaminated water. More recent testing found high PFAS levels in drinking water in 34 major US cities. Some researchers say nearly every source of surface water in the country is contaminated. Recent tests revealed dangerous levels in rain, a range of foods and sewage sludge that farmers spread on cropland as fertilizer. It is estimated that PFAS are in 99% of Americans’ blood, and the chemicals have been found in Arctic animals. In short, “it’s nearly impossible to escape contamination”, said David Andrews, senior scientist for the Environmental Working Group. “The more you try to study it, the more you try to understand how widespread this contamination is, the more you realize how the entire globe and all of our drinking water and food systems are contaminated,” he said. PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 5,000 fluorinated compounds whose nickname as “forever chemicals” comes because they don’t naturally break down and there is no known way to destroy them. The ubiquitous compounds are used to make products water- and stain-resistant, and are commonly found in Teflon, Scotchgard, waterproof rain gear, dental floss, eyeliner, food packaging, carpeting, firefighting foam and a wide range of textiles. The chemicals are particularly dangerous because they are water soluble and easily move through the environment. Landfills, military bases and industrial sites frequently contaminate soil from which the chemicals move into groundwater and aquifers, then pollute nearby wells or municipal drinking sources.    The more you try to study it … the more you realize how the entire globe and all of our drinking water and food systems are contaminated  David Andrews     “When they’re released into world there’s no standard environmental process that breaks them down – they don’t break apart in sunlight or heat,” Andrews said. “They mostly just disperse, and they can build up in concentration, especially in water supplies.” Those exposed to enough PFAS can face devastating and diverse health consequences. The chemicals are linked to issues that include a variety of cancers, thyroid disorders, kidney disease, autoimmune disruptions, liver disease, high cholesterol, developmental problems in fetuses, Parkinson’s disease, bone disease and more. Though some parts of the federal government and chemical companies deny that PFAS are responsible for health problems, a wave of independent, academic and government research in recent years contradicts that claim. In the largest epidemiological study ever conducted, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2012 found a probable link to six diseases afflicting West Virginia residents who were exposed to high levels of PFAS in their drinking water. The culprit was a nearby DuPont chemical plant. Though chemical companies claim it isn’t medically proven that PFAS have caused any deaths, thousands of people poisoned by the compounds have died from diseases linked to them. It’s clear that PFAS are “as a class harmful to so many parts of the body”, said Sonya Lunder of the Sierra Club. “The chemicals are uniquely problematic because they don’t break down in any meaningful way and take up a long residence in the human body … and the scope of the damages it causes are pretty unusual and unprecedented,” she added. Chemical companies have introduced new generations of PFAS that they claim are safer and less accumulative in the environment, but recent testing has found them to be as dangerous and perhaps more mobile than the older chemicals. Still, PFAS production continues unabated. Those calling for a ban charge that the Trump administration is putting chemical companies’ financial interests first – Chemours, DuPont’s PFAS arm, recorded $6.6bn in revenues last year. Donald Trump has threatened to veto the PFAS Action Act, which the House passed with bipartisan support in January. Among other provisions, the act would require the EPA to limit two types of PFAS discharges in drinking water and emissions, place a five-year moratorium on new PFAS production and authorize hundreds of millions of dollars for clean-up.   Related: A trail of toxicity: the US military bases making people sick    The federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry in 2017 recommended dropping the “minimal risk level” from 70ppt to 12ppt for some PFAS chemicals after finding that greater exposure “could be dangerous for sensitive populations like infants and breastfeeding mothers”. However, the Trump administration spiked the report, fearing a “public relations nightmare” and increased cleanup costs for the federal government. The advisory level remains at 70ppt. States such as Washington, New York and New Hampshire have banned some products made with PFAS, while Michigan and New Jersey have lowered drinking water limits. But states are facing criticism for only lowering limits for the two most common varieties of PFAS. That leaves the rest of the nearly 5,000 chemicals in their class unaccounted for. But more legislation is expected to be approved in 2020 as governments are facing mounting pressure to act in a meaningful way, Andres said. “At some point there’s going to be a backlash, and I think we’re starting to see that now.”"
156,health,Glasgow health board takes legal action against hospital contractor,"Scotland’s largest health board, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, has announced it is taking legal action against the contractor that built its crisis-hit super-hospital. Brookfield Multiplex was responsible for the design and construction of the £575m Queen Elizabeth university hospital (QEUH) complex in Glasgow, which has been plagued by serious problems since it opened in 2015.  The health board’s chief executive, Jane Grant, said on Tuesday: “Having sought independent legal advice, we can confirm the board today has agreed to pursue legal action.” She added: “Since its opening, a number of issues have arisen around the operational effectiveness of the hospital which have impacted on the seamless delivery of safe and effective healthcare. I am sorry for the distress this has caused. “I am fully committed to resolving these issues and, alongside the rest of the NHS Board, will address these in a fully transparent and open manner.”  The health board was placed in the Scottish equivalent of special measures last month after revelations about the deaths of two children at the Royal Hospital for Children, part of the QEUH complex. The children were treated on a cancer ward that was later closed because of concerns about water contamination. Anas Sarwar, a Labour MSP for Glasgow, said of the legal action: “If senior managers are now accepting there were problems with the hospital, who is going to take responsibility for opening it and putting patients at risk? At the heart of this scandal is not a contractual arrangement but a catalogue of failings and a cover-up by hospital managers.” In September when concerns about the children’s wards were first raised, the Scottish government’s health secretary, Jeane Freeman, announced a public inquiry into hospital building flaws. The inquiry will also consider safety issues at the new £150m children’s hospital in Edinburgh, whose opening was delayed after final inspections revealed serious concerns about its ventilation system. The Edinburgh project also involved Brookfield Multiplex. One of the children who died in Glasgow was 10-year-old Milly Main, who contracted an infection as she recovered from leukaemia treatment in 2017. Whistleblowers claimed hospital management had been warned of a high risk of infection three weeks before she died. Milly’s mother, Kimberly Darroch, told BBC Scotland she believed her daughter would still be alive if the Glasgow health board had taken action when it was first warned of the problems with the water supply.  In January it emerged that two other patients at Glasgow’s QEUH had died after contracting a fungal infection linked to pigeon droppings."
157,health,Australian health department says supply of key component in coronavirus testing under strain,"The department of health says it is acting to preserve domestic supplies of a critical component in coronavirus testing, which have come under “considerable strain” during the current pandemic. 
The Australian Medical Association told the Guardian on Monday that some jurisdictions had failed to properly stockpile a common reagent critical in the testing of coronavirus, creating supply issues because of the huge demand on Australian laboratories due to Covid-19. 
Chemical reagents are used to extract nucleic acids from swabs taken from potential coronavirus patients. The extraction of ribonucleic acid (RNA) is only one part of the coronavirus testing, but it is crucial in confirming the presence of the virus. 
The reagent used to extract the RNA is not specific to coronavirus and is used in testing for a range of illnesses, including other types of influenza, the AMA said. 
The department of health said there was currently significant pressure on stocks of all consumables used by laboratories. 
But it voiced particular concern about RNA extraction. 
“Due to global demand exceeding supply, stocks of all laboratory related testing consumables are under considerable strain,” a spokeswoman said. 
“At the moment there are particular concerns around supplies of swabs and DNA extraction kits.” 
The department said there was also pressure on the stocks of swabs. 
Urgent steps were being taken to prevent any danger of shortages, the department said, including to “conserve the supply of consumables” already in Australia. 
Doctors were also being urged to only perform tests for those who met the definition of a “suspect case”. The department was analysing the supply chains of multinational manufacturers, and assessing emerging technology and innovative testing methods. 
“Some laboratories are also beginning to screen test request forms for relevant clinical and travel history and where a test is not justified, the testing request is being rejected,” the spokeswoman said.

Chris Moy, the AMA’s president in South Australia, said Australia currently has “very variable stocking” of the RNA extraction reagent across different states and territories. 
 
  Related: Australian stocks of coronavirus testing kits 'rapidly deteriorating', says chief medical officer  
 
That’s left some jurisdictions facing supply issues but others well-prepared, he said. 
South Australia was singled out for praise. It has spent the past decade “carefully” stockpiling a supply of the reagent, something Moy said was a complex and difficult task. 
“You need this reagent to do the test,” Moy told the Guardian, speaking from a clinic where he is testing potential coronavirus patients. “There’s probably two issues at the moment. Firstly, there has been very variable stocking by the state pathology services of this.” 
“The other reason why there is a bit of a burn-through ... there is still a proportion of the ‘worried well’ getting tested. The problem with that is the criteria for testing keeps changing.” 
Moy said the problem again showed the need for the establishment of a nationally-coordinated disease control authority, similar to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. 
 
  Related: Australian state governments declare public health emergencies to contain coronavirus  
 
“It just shows again that dealing with a pandemic which is a state thing can’t rely on jurisdictional inconsistencies, and also that dealing with a pandemic is a practical not a theoretical issue. That’s why the AMA has been calling for a centre for disease control to coordinate responses.” 
Australia is hardly alone in facing strain on its supply of reagent. 
Last week, the head of the US Food and Drug Administration, Stephen Hahn, said he was “aware of pressure in the supply system on the reagents” needed in coronavirus testing. The agency was working 24/7 to address the problem, he said, and was seeking to supply laboratories with reagent alternatives. 
Grattan Institute health program director Stephen Duckett, a former secretary of the health department, said Australian officials had know for weeks that testing supply issues would arise. He said more should have been done to forecast the demand for testing. 
“Were there estimates of demand?” he asked. 
 
  
  
   
    
    The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.
    The UN agency&nbsp;advises&nbsp;people to:
    
     Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap
     Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing
     Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough
     Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers
     Advice about face masks varies. Wearing them while out and about may offer some protection against both spreading and catching the virus via coughs and sneezes, but it is not a cast-iron guarantee of protection
    
    Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.&nbsp;
    In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;stay at home for at least 7 days.
    If you live with other people,&nbsp;they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.
    
   
  
  
 
“At the moment they are still basically saying we can’t meet demand. We can only test those who have very clear symptoms.” 
Paul Kelly, the deputy chief medical officer, said supply issues with “consumables” were rapidly emerging, but not surprising. 
“There are some issues in relation to some of the consumables around the tests. That’s a global issue,” he said. “As you can imagine, there’s a lot of testing going on. All of those 160,000 people that we have definite diagnoses on have had at least one test.” 
Moy said the government’s decision to bring private laboratories into the testing regime would help alleviate the pressure, as would stricter and more consistent criteria for who can be tested. 
The New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, said on Monday his state had a significant capacity for testing, compared with other jurisdictions. He urged only those who met certain criteria went for testing. 
“The reason why I’m telling people that is that obviously pathology laboratories have a limited amount of capacity,” he said. “We have a very big capacity here in New South Wales compared to other states and territories, but it’s still limited. It’s finite . 
“We need to make sure those likely to have the test, can have the test.” 
• This article was amended on 17 March 2020. A previous version, which was based on advice from the department of health, referred to DNA extraction in the test for coronavirus. Covid-19 is an RNA virus and DNA is not extracted in the process of testing."
158,health,Australian doctors call for coronavirus tests to be fast-tracked for health workers,"The head of the Australian Medical Association has urged the health department to prioritise processing Covid-19 tests of frontline healthcare workers.  There have been reports that some doctors and nurses have been in isolation for days waiting for results. “We’ve now made it clear that because of the crucial nature of their role in the frontline response that it’s in everyone’s interest health worker results are expedited,” Dr Tony Bartone said. “I believe that … is now being heard by everyone and largely agreed to. It is so important because this is a national emergency and we need those workers.”   Related: Coronavirus testing explained: how does it work and how quickly can you get a response in Australia?    However, a nurse working in Melbourne told Guardian Australia on Friday that she had only that day received her Covid-19 test result despite being swabbed a week ago. She was required to self-isolate and remain away from her hospital workplace during that time. In Victoria patients are being told to expect a test result within 72 hours of the swab being collected. “I’m a nurse and I was working with patients who potentially had the virus and, essentially, I got symptoms while working with those patients,” she said. “So to be super careful, I got the test and isolated myself. I was told when they swabbed me last Friday they would put me on top of the list.” She rang the hospital where she was tested several times – it was not the hospital where she works – asking for results but was told they were not ready.  The last time she rang, on Thursday, she was told the result was in but she could not be given it and that it had to come from her doctor or the health department. She rang her doctor who tried to get the results, but was unable to get them from the department. The department finally rang on Friday and told her she was negative. “It was really frustrating, especially since I heard the patients I worked with, who had been tested, had since returned negative results but I still didn’t have mine and couldn’t return to work,” she said. She added that delays meant the number of cases in Victoria may be much higher than they seemed compared to other states, if other states were receiving their results more quickly. Guardian Australia has contacted the federal and state health departments for comment. There is a global shortage of the test kits that pathologists use to diagnose Covid-19 which is why there is targeted testing instead of widespread testing in Australia.  The only people who should be tested under the current guidelines are those who have returned from overseas in the past 14 days and develop respiratory illness, those who have been in close contact with a confirmed Covid-19 case in the past 14 days and develop respiratory illness, and those with pneumonia. Healthcare workers who work directly with patients and who have a respiratory illness and a fever can get tested regardless of whether they have travelled overseas or have had close contact with an infected person. Laboratories have been working around the clock to process tests, and patients who do not need the testing criteria have been urged not to ask doctors and hospitals for the swabs as this adds to the backlog.

159,health,Global health challenges: how innovative collaboration is key to tackling diseases,"Many people across the world are living longer, healthier lives than their predecessors. But – according to the World Health Organization – at least half of the global population of almost 8 billion people still do not have full access to essential health services. Every year, more than 200 million new cases of malaria are reported. In 2018, 9.6 million people died of cancer – one in every six global deaths, while 71% (around 41 million) of all deaths globally were due to non-communicable diseases. “It is critical that innovation continues and needs to be encouraged – now more than ever,” says Komal Kalha, head of intellectual property and trade policy at IFPMA. Creating new collaborations and partnerships, where innovation can thrive is an important part of today’s research and development landscape. Often developed through knowledge hubs and incubators, and traversing different sectors and industries, these joint ventures are a place where entrepreneurs’ ideas come to fruition, and real healthcare innovation takes place. “The aim of collaborative innovation is to partner across sectors, leverage expertise and find solutions that are long-term and sustainable,” says Kalha. “In addition to access to capital and talent to innovate, other ways to incentivise innovation include an efficient regulatory system that is predictable, transparent and scientifically rigorous, and has respect for intellectual property,” she says. Jaak Peeters, head of global public health at Johnson &amp; Johnson, agrees that joint ventures are the way forward. “We can only solve diseases like HIV and TB if we embrace public-private cooperation and enter an era of extreme collaboration,” he says. Huge progress has been made tackling HIV, he says, with some 40 new drugs, simplified treatment regimes and a near-normal life expectancy for people living with HIV – but such progress wouldn’t have been made without collaborations that supported innovation.      “With other new technologies on the horizon, we must come together now to ensure we have the right capabilities and resources in place to ensure they will reach the patients who need them as quickly as possible,” he says. “Recognising we can’t do this alone, we seek to bring together public and private resources, invest in science both inside and outside of our walls, and offer access to our R&amp;D capabilities.” Johnson &amp; Johnson is one of eight drug companies working with the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), a UN agency, on its WIPO Re:Search platform. WIPO Re:Search catalyses the development of new medicines and technologies in the fight against neglected tropical diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. Through innovative research partnerships and research and development collaborations it makes intellectual property available to researchers who need it. Its Resource Platform, managed by non-profit Bio Ventures for Global Health (BVGH) connects pharmaceutical companies with academia, and mobilises and encourages businesses to share their expertise and assets.      “This gives scientists important skills and experience, helping them develop new and improved treatments, while companies gain insights into new applications for their existing drugs and knowledge about expanding markets,” says BVGH’s chief executive Jennifer Dent. A current partnership between MSD and the University of California, San Diego, for instance, is looking at how the company’s cholesterol-lowering statins can also be used to kill the parasitic worms that cause snail fever, a disease that afflicts more than 100 million people each year. Repurposing medicines to treat other conditions is an important part of these new collaborations and can help to bypass many of the time-consuming stages of early drug discovery.   Related: From falsified medicines to storage mishaps: the fragile state of drug supply chains    Another partnership is tackling TB, which now kills more people each year than HIV and malaria put together. WIPO Re:Search has brokered a joint venture between Japanese drug company Takeda and the University of British Columbia, which allows researchers to mine Takeda’s historical research into protein inhibitors as part of their work on a new TB drug. IFPMA’s own knowledge hub, Global Health Progress, is another platform championing collaborations. It details more than 200 partnerships that are using innovative approaches to confront global health challenges and transform traditional ways of working by bringing together different business sectors, from manufacturing to telecommunications and finance. Collaboration around other technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence, big data, and machine learning is increasingly being seen as just as important to healthcare solutions as biology and chemistry. These partnerships have already led to innovations such as wearable tech devices, which monitor biological data in real time. The use of telemedicine, too, may soon be in the ascendant. India alone has more than 420 million mobile internet users, representing a significant proportion of the population that could be reached by an integrated online healthcare system – one which may become a reality by 2022 with the government’s National Health Stack programme.      Individual pharma companies have also set up their own incubators and hubs. The Pfizer-IIT Delhi Innovation and IP programme has been co-created by Pfizer and the Foundation for Innovation and Technology Transfer (FITT) as a collaborative incubation accelerator, with a focus on innovation and IP. “There are collaborations taking place across the world and in different sectors,” says Kalha. “However, gaps do exist and these need to be addressed – we talk about access to medicines but we often forget that developing sustainable healthcare solutions and getting them to patients is no easy task and it cannot be done alone,” she says. “In order to get new and efficient products to market, you must incentivise innovation. It is not just collaborations within the pharma industry that are important – they need to be cross-sector, too. If there are other stakeholders out there, willing to work to advance innovation with industry, then let’s do it.”"
160,health,'Delivers the stats like no other': New Zealand's Covid-19 crush on health chief,"An unassuming civil servant has become the unlikely hero of New Zealand’s coronavirus crisis, earning thousands of fans online and being nominated for the country’s highest honour. Dr Ashley Bloomfield is the director-general of health and the public face of the country’s battle against the disease, alongside prime minister Jacinda Ardern. Since March, Bloomfield has been fronting near-daily televised press conferences and has swiftly become a figure of fascination in a nation that has enjoyed early success in the global fight against coronavirus.   Related: Sex toy sales triple during New Zealand's coronavirus lockdown    Quietly spoken and always impeccably prepared, Bloomfield has impressed with his depth of knowledge and quick recall of statistics and unflappable demeanour. New Zealand writer Anna Connell jokingly changed her Twitter handle to The Ashley Bloomfield Fan Club after repeatedly admiring his cool during press conferences. Overnight, her followers began to grow, and she is now the unofficial leader of the nation’s Bloomfield devotees. “It’s unusual to have people unifying so positively around one person on Twitter, but it’s really hard to find anyone saying a bad word about him,” Connell said. “I think he just epitomises something quite wholesome; he’s not political, he’s got a neutrality about him. He is a very appealing kind of guy. He’s very calm, and he’s very measured – and he’s got really nice hair.” Dan Laufer, an expert in crisis communication at Victoria university, says Bloomfield’s public-sector background means he is able to command respect regardless of people’s political affiliations.

Knight the guy when we see the end of this. #Respect&mdash; Paul Ardern (@PArdern) March 31, 2020    According to the ministry of health, Bloomfield qualified in medicine at the University of Auckland in 1990 and specialised in public health, choosing to focus on non-communicable disease prevention and control. In 2011 he spent a year at the World Health Organization in Geneva, learning many of the skills he is now deploying to manage the outbreak. Although the memes and fandom surrounding Bloomfield have a playful edge – and offer a fun distraction for many New Zealanders during a tense time – Connell believes Bloomfield is genuinely providing comfort. “I think he is a figurehead of ‘keep calm and carry on’,” she says. “I don’t think people knew what they were looking for at this time, but it turned out it was exactly him.”"
161,health,One in four young people with mental health referral 'rejected',"One in four children and young people referred to mental health services in England last year were not accepted for treatment, according to data, raising concerns that many are still failing to get vital support at an early stage. Research by the Education Policy Institute (EPI) estimated that more than 130,000 of those referred to specialist services in 2018-19 were “rejected”, among them young people who have self-harmed, suffered eating disorders and experienced abuse. According to the EPI, rejection rates have remained unchanged over the last four years, despite government commitments to address shortages in child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS), including an additional £1.4bn investment between 2015 and 2021. The research also revealed significant regional variations, with services in London rejecting 17% of referrals on average, compared with 28% in the south, the Midlands and the east, and 22% in the north. Providers said treatment was not given mainly because children’s conditions were not suitable, or were not serious enough to meet the threshold. The average median waiting time to begin treatment has fallen by 11 days since 2015, but children still had to wait an average of two months. David Laws, EPI’s executive chairman, lamented the lack of progress. “Young people continue to be deprived of access to specialist mental health treatment, despite the government claiming significant investment in mental health services over the past five years. “Progress in improving access over this period has been hugely disappointing, and it is unacceptable that as many as one in four children referred to mental health services are being turned away.” The EPI report is based on data collected via freedom of information requests to more than 60 mental health service providers. NHS England said the EPI’s analysis was “flawed” and it was wrong to assume that every referral should result in NHS treatment, when more appropriate support might be provided elsewhere, for example from schools and local authorities. “The NHS is actually ahead of its target on ensuring as many children as possible receive mental health care – seeing an extra 53,000 children, teenagers and young adults last year, a 14% increase on the year before and 22% more staff in services than five years ago, against a backdrop of rising referrals,” an NHS spokesperson said. Teachers’ leaders warned that schools were struggling to fill the gap. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “This report confirms what schools know only too well – that thresholds for children’s mental health services are often too high and waiting lists too long. “It is an appalling postcode lottery which leaves schools struggling to secure the specialist help needed by young people suffering from serious mental health illnesses.” The mental health charity Mind said something clearly was not working when thousands of vulnerable young people were still being turned down for treatment. “It is deeply concerning that a staggering 133,000 young people are not getting help for serious mental health problems,” said Vicki Nash, head of policy and campaigns. “Whatever your age, if you have self-harmed, experienced abuse, or have a mental health problem like an eating disorder, you deserve support. Extra money outlined in the NHS Long Term Plan is welcome, to tackle decades of underfunding, but it can’t reach the frontline soon enough.” • In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

162,health,"US underprepared for coronavirus due to Trump cuts, say health experts","US preparedness to deal with the threat of coronavirus has been hampered by the personnel and budget cuts made by the Trump administration over the past three years, according to health experts. There is no one in the White House tasked specifically to oversee a coordinated government-wide response in the event of a pandemic, since the post of senior director for global health security and biothreats on the national security council (NSC) was eliminated last May.   Related: University apologizes for saying xenophobia is 'common reaction' to coronavirus spread    The office was established in 2016 after the outbreak of the Ebola virus in Africa demonstrated the US government was not set up to move with the speed and decisiveness necessary to react to a really lethal epidemic. The White House global health “czar” was supposed to coordinate international, national, state and local organisations, public and private, to confront a global epidemic, backed by the direct authority of the president. After he became national security adviser, John Bolton eliminated the office as part of an NSC reorganisation, as he did not see global health issues as a national security priority. As the first person-to-person transmission of coronavirus in the US was reported, and as evidence emerges that it could be much more contagious than initially thought, health and disaster planning experts argued for contingency preparations for a global outbreak. “You have to at least now be anticipating and responsibly planning against a sort of pandemic level scenario reaching the US,” Jeremy Konyndyk, who ran foreign disaster assistance in the Obama administration, said. “The fact that they explicitly dismantled the office in the White House that was tasked with preparing for exactly this kind of a risk is hugely concerning,” said Konyndyk, now a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development. “Both the structure and all the institutional memory is gone now.” Funding has also been cut drastically to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), forcing it to reduce or discontinue epidemic-prevention efforts in 39 out of the 49 countries it had been helping. Among the countries where CDC efforts were scaled back were Haiti, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo as well as China, where the agency provided technical assistance. In its 2020 budget the Trump administration proposed a further 10% cut in CDC funding, equivalent to $750m. It zeroed out funding for epidemiology and laboratory capacity at state and local levels.   Related: How to protect yourself from coronavirus    Funding will also dry up this year for a tiered epidemic response within the US. The system was set up in the aftermath of the Ebola scare, and involved identifying patients infected by “special pathogens” in frontline hospitals and their transfer up a chain of specially equipped regional hospitals where they could be safely treated. After this year’s cuts, 10 advanced treatment facilities will still receive funding, but not the 60 other treatment centres one tier below. “Those assessment and treatment hospitals are kind of wondering where they’re going to get funding to continue these very costly efforts,” said Saskia Popescu, an infection prevention epidemiologist, at George Mason University. “So not only are we creating more vulnerable hospitals, but we’re getting this message across that hospitals, if you want to prepare, you’re kind of on your own.”"
163,health,"Health workers 'going to Bunnings' to source personal protective equipment, doctor tells Q+A","Senior health workers have resorted to shopping at Bunnings to source personal protective equipment because of shortages during the Covid-19 crisis, an emergency doctor has said. Stephen Parnis, a Victorian emergency doctor and former vice president of the Australian Medical Association, told the ABC’s Q+A program on Monday night that health workers were “very worried” about supplies of protective equipment. “I spoke to a number of colleagues around the country before coming on to the program and I have to say we’re all very worried about the provision of personal protective equipment,” Parnis said.   Related: Delay in locally sourcing coronavirus tests is a ‘failure of government’, crossbencher says    “I’ve seen department directors going to Bunnings and seen people look and hope they might have contacts overseas. And it’s probably the number one concern for health workers around the country at the moment. Guardian Australia has previously reported fears of shortages of PPE in the health system as the number of cases of Covid-19 rises across Australia. Rural Aboriginal medical services in particular face a “catastrophic” shortage. Monday’s Q+A, dedicated to the experiences of frontline healthcare workers, revealed significant concern among doctors about the shortage. Vyom Sharma, a general practitioner from Victoria, said his practice was down to about 10 surgical masks and suggested the federal government should have done more to source supplies sooner. “We’re trying to save them for when we really need them,” he said. “And the concern is it’s actually affecting the nature of care we can provide. We are transitioning to telehealth at the moment, offering face-to-face consultations when required. But they have to be reduced in a way that’s commensurate to the supply we have available.     Sign up for Guardian Australia’s daily coronavirus email newsletter   “It’s correct what Steven [Parnis] said, we’re very worried about the lack of personal protective equipment and it’s been affecting the care we’ve been offering patients throughout. When the criteria for Covid-19 had been changing gradually through February and March, a huge percentage of my population were overseas students and travellers and tourists. “And you’re rationing masks even then. And there are people coughing and sneezing one day who come from South Korea or Italy and a few day later the criteria changes and it says these people are high risk and you wonder ‘should I have used a mask on them and I would have if I had enough’.” Lucy Morgan, a respiratory physician from Sydney’s Nepean hospital, said she was “reassured” by work done to supply public hospitals with PPE as the number of Covid-19 cases began to quickly escalate in March. But, she said, healthcare workers in other areas including GPs and specialists in private practice could find it harder to source equipment. “Their access to protective gear is a little bit less secure. I think they have, they haven’t got the same bargaining power or purchasing power that hospitals or health departments have. And I think that’s another challenge for us,” she said. Also on Monday, shadow minister for health Chris Bowen criticised the Ruby Princess fiasco after the death of a 12th former passenger of the cruise ship. “There has to be a full explanation to the Australian people about how Border Force let that happen. It is just unacceptable.” Liberal MP Katie Allen said she was pleased that New South Wales police commissioner Mick Fuller had launched a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess case “so that we can get to the bottom of actually what happened”. A former medical researcher, Allen said the government had been increasing hospital capacity in preparation for more cases of the virus. “As a government, we’re being very careful about looking at ventilator capacity and we’re also bringing more nurses online because those intensive care beds need 24-hour care and we do need more nurses,” she said. “[We are] bringing more people into the workforce to make sure we’re ready for a possibility that may actually not actually eventuate but we need to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.” "
164,health,I'm into health food and hot yoga. I'm also addicted to vaping,"I like to think of myself as a healthy, calm lady-boss who aims to inspire others. My morning routine consists of transcendental meditation, light therapy and boxing before 8am. When I’m not in front of my computer or traveling for a public speaking gig, I’m usually in a hot yoga class. And so it may surprise my clients, family, and friends that I am one of the 50 million people around the globe addicted to e-cigarette juice. If you’ve ever heard the phrase “Juuling”, you probably picture a teenager who rips a Juul that’s hidden in the sleeve of their hoodie, holding in the hit so as not to get caught vaping in math class, not a middle-class woman in her early 30s who gets HydraFacials and sips turmeric tea.   Related: How Juul gets kids addicted to vaping: it's even worse than you think | Nancy Jo Sales    The juice, better known as e-liquid, in a vape or e-cigarette usually contains nicotine and other ingredients like propylene glycol, and vegetable glycerin, which is heated to create an inhalable aerosol. Juul is the most popular vaping product. Using influencer marketing and with celebrity endorsements like Dave Chappelle hitting his Juul during his 2017 Netflix special, Sophie Turner proclaiming having her Juul taken away was the secret to acting, and an Instagrammable photo of Katy Perry sporting her Juul at the Golden Globes, the company went from selling an unknown product to owning the category and from $200m in sales in 2017 to $1.3bn the following year. According to a Jama study, more than one in four students (28% of high schoolers) vape nicotine. Dr Karen Wilson of the American Academy of Pediatrics said that she sees “kids that are using four pods” –the nicotine equivalent of four packs of cigarettes – a day. Adults who vape often use it as a smoking cessation tool. And some adults have entered vape culture, mixing and selling custom flavors and labeling themselves as do-it-yourselfers, cloud chasers, sub-ohmers, coil builders or modders. When it comes to culture I appreciate, I’m more of a literature or health food aficionado. I’ve never discussed my mod or coil on Reddit, nor do I know how to blow a vape cloud in the shape of a jellyfish.    Like many, I was surprised when the number of people with a severe lung illness linked to vaping had reached over 2,600 cases and nearly 60 deaths    Yet, like the teenager we envision being naively pressured into the habit, three years ago I adopted the common belief that e-cigarettes are less harmful than other forms of tobacco. Like many, I was surprised when the number of people with a severe lung illness linked to vaping had reached over 2,600 cases and nearly 60 deaths. Recently, we’ve learned that the key culprit behind those illnesses is probably black market THC vapes using specific additives including a form of vitamin E. Even so, the FDA and Trump administration are pushing for a national ban on most e-cigarette flavors and San Francisco became the first major US city to ban sales altogether. Students in Texas can face felony charges and expulsions from school for having a vape in their backpacks. It’s an effort to keep the product out of the hands of teens, but the move will affect adults, too – free-thinking adults who vape for a variety of reasons such as to quit smoking or for the subculture – people like myself. I was first introduced to vaping as a tool to quit smoking three years ago when I visited my family in Michigan. In my parents’ living room playing with my niece and nephew, my brother puffed clouds of white smoke from a device that looked like a walkie-talkie with a short antenna. My stepdad shook his head with every drag. My brother held the cloud in his mouth and said: “It’s just vape.” Technically, I had given up my half-pack a day habit and quit smoking years before, but the urge was still there. One beer and I’d hide out in the garage with my mom bumming her Marlboro Lights in Michigan or find myself standing in the smokers’ circle outside my favorite East Village bar. Smoking was a form of social currency around other people. Alone, it offered an escape, a ceremony that felt secret and sacred.     ‘With 5 million teens caught in this trap, I don’t think bans on e-cigarette flavors will stop resourceful young people.’ Photograph: Steven Senne/AP    Vaping had the same benefits but felt better than smoking because I could conceal my device in a pencil case like the colorful pens I carry around. It didn’t leave a lingering odor that others could detect. No one gives you side-eye or a judgmental cough if they can’t see or smell it. Home in Brooklyn, I noticed vaping was everywhere. Soon, a friendly guy behind a cloud of strawberry vanilla at the local smoke shop set me up with my own device. The danger of vaping is that it’s hidden in plain sight. Smoking is banned in nearly all public spaces, but we haven’t figured out how to stop people from vaping. You can do it nearly anywhere without being noticed, and the amount of nicotine being consumed is also hidden, clicked into a sleek, Stanford University-born device. Juuls don’t create a large cloud and can easily be hidden in your hand. Airports, the movies, classrooms, places where we would never think to light up a cigarette are spaces where you can take a hit without causing a scene. Initially, it seemed innocuous, and yet, from the beginning, it negatively affected my lifestyle. Instead of the co-working spaces and coffee shops I patronized, I soon opted to work from home so I could enjoy mid-meeting puffs of mango delight. Once, I excused myself to the bathroom during a quarterly in-person meeting with my most loyal client. In the stall, I took a small toke and held it securely in my mouth until I was certain it disappeared. My relaxing moment turned to burning fear as the fire alarm sounded throughout the building. I thought about flushing my device; instead, I ran outside to meet my colleagues with a red face. I spent the night Googling whether I had caused the alarm to sound. Although it was a routine drill, after that incident, bargaining with myself to work from home became part of my morning routine.    We need to share tangible ways for people to quit – and that information should be as easy to find as the steps to fix a leaking pod    In April, when I started boxing, my hunch that vaping was hurting my body was solidified. As soon as I got good enough to throw a strong jab, the congestion in my lungs hit like a body shot and moved its way up my torso until my ears were plugged. It was time for me to quit. It’s no surprise that experts say withdrawal from vaping can be more challenging than quitting conventional cigarettes. The first time I tried to break my own two-pod-a-day addiction, I promised myself I wouldn’t buy another pack. I changed my walking route so I wouldn’t pass my local smoke shop every night. But by mid-morning of day one, I searched pockets of pants in my dirty laundry and old purses for pods with enough juice to get me through the day. I ended up watching a YouTube video where a shirtless high schooler with a seashell necklace told me that putting a leaking pod into the freezer for three minutes would reactivate it. “Ninety-nine-point-nine of the time it works. For you kids who are addicted to this thing like I am …” But I was not a kid, I was a 31-year-old grownup. The shame I felt when I popped my last non-working pod into the freezer felt like rock bottom.   Related: Breaking up with my Juul: why quitting vaping is harder than quitting cigarettes    Vaping wasn’t something I could stomp out on the ground and move on from. Strong willpower, my embarrassment, and at the time, the CDC’s recommendation that people give up vaping of all kinds until the cause of the lung damage was determined – none of it mattered. The benefit of being an adult with this addiction is that I had the resources for cessation products, and if necessary I could work with an addiction specialist. It took hundreds of dollars’ worth of the highest-dose patches and a mix of nicotine mints and gum for me to stop searching for loose pods around my apartment. With 5 million teens caught in this trap, I don’t think bans on e-cigarette flavors will stop resourceful young people like the shirtless high schooler from finding ways to fend off the agitation, inability to focus, and headaches that come with trying to quit. Instead of imposing unreasonable laws, we need to figure out and share tangible ways for different people who are addicted to quit – and that information should be as easy to find as the steps to fix a leaking pod. After I’d been off the juice for a month, I was walking to my office one morning when I saw an empty cartridge on the sidewalk. I asked myself, if this were full, would I pick it up and use it? The answer was yes. Another hit, another drag, another puff, just one more. It doesn’t have a flame, but it never burns out."
165,health,EU states look in poor health to withstand a global crisis,"The focus was inevitably on Britain as the clock ticked down on Friday night towards the moment of departure from the European Union. How would the economy fare on the outside of the world’s biggest market in the years to come? What sort of trade deal with the EU would be cooked up in the scant time available for negotiations? How easy would it be to do a deal with the arch-protectionist Donald Trump? Those are all perfectly reasonable questions. But they are based on an assumption: that Britain is weak and doing badly, and the remaining 27 members of the EU are strong and doing well. That, most definitely, is not the case. Official figures showed that growth in the eurozone eased back from 0.3% to 0.1% in the final three months of 2019. France and Italy – the second- and third-biggest monetary-union countries – both recorded falls in output. Data for Germany, Europe’s powerhouse economy, has yet to be released, but the signs are that it grew by as little as 0.1%. Strikes in France were partly responsible for the 0.1% drop in French GDP but industrial unrest was not to blame for the 0.3% contraction in Italy, a country where output has yet to regain pre-financial crisis levels. Germany, meanwhile, has been struggling because its economy depends on the export of manufacturing goods. These have been adversely affected by a slowdown in global demand exacerbated by President Trump’s aggressive approach to trade. At the start of the year there was some hope that the global economy had bottomed out. Central banks had provided a fresh dose of monetary stimulus, and demand seemed to be picking up. Washington and Beijing called a truce in their trade war. The International Monetary Fund was starting to sound a bit more optimistic about the state of the global economy.    Europe has never really recovered from the last crisis    Then the coronavirus struck. It is too early to say whether the deaths in China represent a Black Swan event – something that comes as a shock and has a major impact – but the crisis certainly has the potential to be one. Already there have been indications of slower growth in China, curbs on air travel, and fears that global supply chains could be severed. None of which is good for Germany or the wider European economy. If, as most economists expect, the Chinese government quickly gets to grips with the coronavirus, the hit to the global economy will be brief and modest. If it doesn’t, the EU is in serious trouble. Why? First there is not a great deal of scope to loosen policy, at least in the conventional sense. The European Central Bank is operating with negative interest rates and has restarted its quantitative easing – or money creation – programme. There is not a lot more the ECB can do. Second, Europe has never really recovered from the last crisis. The ECB was slower than the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, slower to experiment with quantitative easing, and lacked the wherewithal to sort out the bad-debt problems of Europe’s banks. So while the credit channels in the US are again functioning, in the eurozone they are still blocked, making monetary policy less effective than it would otherwise be. There is one final problem: monetary union will remain half-baked without a banking union and a unified eurozone budget. Neither – largely due to German opposition – is remotely in prospect. The year ahead is going to be tough – just as tough, if not tougher, than it will be for the UK. Aston Martin pins its hopes on Bond and an SUV Aston Martin’s much-hyped stock market float has ended with a humiliating bailout by a billionaire not even 18 months later. The luxury carmaker’s executives, international shareholders and bankers made fortunes from the initial public offering in late 2018. Aston Martin was “worth” £4.3bn at the time, a valuation that was rapidly revealed to be fanciful. A plan that relied on a new factory doubling total production meant that the company’s chief executive, Andy Palmer, was always walking a tightrope. When sales dropped and costs kept rising, Aston Martin was left horribly exposed. The serial fashion investor Lawrence Stroll, who led the rescue consortium and will now become executive chairman, at least appears to have his heart in it, with a pledge to use the Aston Martin brand on his Formula One racing team for the next decade.  Investors have welcomed Stroll. Following a cash injection to stave off bankruptcy, the shares rose 24% on Friday (though they are still just a quarter of their £19 float price). With the prospect of a James Bond marketing blitz around the latest film in April – just as Aston Martin starts production of its new DBX SUV – and the stardust of Formula One, there might finally be a few reasons for cautious optimism at the company’s HQ in Warwickshire. Still, there are bumps ahead. The bet on an untested SUV is not a surefire winner. Nor are luxury products aimed at the rich immune from shocks. China is key for the SUV, so the coronavirus could not have come at a worse time. Slashing investment in zero-emissions electric battery technology will surely store up problems for the future for shareholders (not to mention the planet). Palmer needs the DBX launch to go to plan if the bailout is not to become his swan song.     007 to the rescue? Daniel Craig in the forthcoming Bond film No Time to Die. Photograph: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer    Ticketing watchdog needs rather more bite No one familiar with “secondary” ticketing will have been surprised to see the ticket resale site StubHub criticised by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for allegedly misleading consumers and potentially breaking consumer law. After all, we’ve been here before. The CMA has fought a long-running battle with StubHub’s chief rival, Viagogo, which refused to change its ways until the CMA resorted to legal action. StubHub styles itself as the more acceptable face of ticketing. Now it has been accused by the regulator of Viagogo-style transgressions, such as selling tickets without warning buyers that they might be refused entry to events when artists have imposed prohibitions on resale. The company also allegedly misleads consumers about the scarcity of available tickets – a pressure-selling tactic. If both major resale sites behave like this, what hope is there of any improvement if Viagogo’s proposed £3.1bn takeover of StubHub goes ahead, creating an unrivalled industry powerhouse? The CMA is currently weighing up whether to intervene in the British part of this tie-up on monopoly grounds. It is hard to imagine why it would allow the two major players in the UK’s ticket resale market to get together, even if they had spotless records. While the watchdog has the power to intervene in the merger, its teeth are less sharp when it comes to consumer law. The CMA can go to court but it’s a lengthy and costly process that requires a judge to make a ruling. That’s why the CMA’s chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, used the StubHub announcement to call for the regulator to be given greater powers to determine when consumer law has been broken and to issue fines. Given the difficulty it has had in bringing StubHub and Viagogo to heel, it is hard to argue that the CMA should be denied more effective ways of exercising its authority."

168,health,Spike in Ebola cases alarms health officials in DRC,"Health officials are investigating an alarming spike in Ebola cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with many blamed on a single individual who appears to have contracted the disease for a second time this year. 
Amid the struggle to bring the 16-month outbreak under control, the World Health Organization noted an almost 300% increase in cases in the last three weeks, with 17 of 27 linked to a single chain of transmission. 
 
 Ebola cases in DRC. 
 
According to officials, it appears to be the second time the person has been documented as suffering from Ebola in six months. An investigation is being held to understand the circumstances around the case. 
Ten cases were notified on Wednesday in Mabalako, North Kivu province, where the individual is believed to be from, after another six on Tuesday, according to officials who noted that three out of the six were practitioners of traditional medicine. 
 
  Related: Ebola responders face deadly attacks. We must step up security in DRC  
 
The spike – and the worrying circumstances behind it – appears to buck a trend towards a declining number of cases, although security issues in the key zones of Beni, Biakato and Mangina had recently paralysed the response after violent attacks on health workers. 
Among the possibilities being examined are reinfection with the disease – which would ring the most serious alarm bells as no case of reinfection has ever been recorded before – or a relapse. 
 
  
  
   
    
    Ebola virus disease (EVD) first appeared in 1976 in two outbreaks, located in what is now known as South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The latter outbreak was in a village near the Ebola River, giving the disease its name.
    Ebola causes fever, aches and diarrhoea and attacks the immune system, causing blood clotting cells to malfunction so that victims bleed extensively and die if their immune system cannot fight off the viral infection. It is spread from person to person through body fluids.
    Infected patients are isolated and treated by medical teams wearing full protective body suits who try to boost their immune response. The average case fatality rate is around 50% - and health-care workers have frequently been infected. Burial ceremonies involving direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute to transmission.
    A vaccine, still experimental, has proven to be highly effective in preventing the disease, according to the World Health Organization.&nbsp;
    
   
  
  
 
While rare cases of relapse have been documented, in which a person who has recovered from Ebola gets its symptoms again, reinfection would mean a person who has recovered has been infected anew with the virus by another person, a circumstance so far undocumented. 
Experts have long been anxious about the risk of recurrence because the virus can persist for months in areas of the body that are immunologically protected, including semen, vaginal fluids, sweat, aqueous humour, urine, breast milk and even spinal fluid after initial onset and recovery. 
That has led researchers to speculate about the continued risk of transmission in individuals not showing any symptoms, including through sexual activity, leading to reactivation of the illness. 
Reinfection, relapse and recurrence are all sources of acute concern in controlling the outbreak, as Ebola survivors are employed widely in treatment centres in DRC on the assumption they cannot usually recontract or transmit the disease. 
In July another patient died from what was also presumed to be a relapse or reinfection, calling into question the assumption that Ebola survivors have lifelong immunity from the virus. 
According to figures from the African Union as of 8 December, the Ebola outbreak in DRC has claimed 2,209 lives since it broke out, with 3,327 recorded cases."
169,health,Health fears could curb the flavour options in e-cigarettes,"Vaping companies could be asked to fund research into the health effects of flavoured liquids used in e-cigarettes under plans being considered by the UK’s medicines watchdog. The proposal, outlined to the Observer by an expert on tobacco control, comes as studies link e-liquid flavours such as mint, creme brulee and cinnamon to heart and lung problems. Last week, the US announced a ban on most e-liquid flavours over fears that vaping has reached epidemic proportions among teenagers. But this ban applies only to vape “pods” – individual cartridges used in vape pens to deliver flavour popular with young people – and not to the larger “tanks”, and some experts worry that users will simply switch. Professor John Britton, director of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies at Nottingham University, who sits on the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)’s panel on e-cigarettes, said flavours were really important to smokers: “If you restrict the flavours, you may restrict the tolerability of vaping to people trying it for the first time, but you will also lose an awful lot of smokers.”    There is no way of saying that cinnamon is safer than orange. I don’t see how you draw the line  John Britton, health expert     The US’s shift has invited scrutiny of the UK’s stance on e-liquids, which has been criticised by bodies such as the European Respiratory Society Tobacco Control Committee. An expert committee on toxicity will report to the Department of Health in the spring but it is not expected to recommend that flavours be banned. Alternatives to a ban are being explored, Britton said. “One suggestion is for vaping companies to club together to get flavours licensed. This would give these companies a marketing advantage and perhaps set their shareholders’ concerns about future litigation at rest. Most vaping companies are small, and can’t afford the time or investment in to get a flavour through the medicine licensing process.” He continued: “The only way that could happen would really be if a number of companies grouped together and applied for a common licence for a particular flavour or set of flavours. Then you would have something that would be safe to medicinal standards and at that point you can stop worrying about it.” Some of the larger vaping companies are owned by big tobacco, which has a history of manipulating scientific evidence. Measures would be needed to ensure any flavour testing was carried out by independent experts selected by the relevant health bodies. A new testing regime could see the end to certain flavours. “If you look at the list of flavours that are available in the UK, it’s huge,” Britton said. “It would be very hard to argue that all of those are necessary but how do you then say ‘this one is OK and this one isn’t’? You could say ‘OK, no flavours’ in which case you will make vaping unacceptable to most vapers. Or you could say ‘we’ll allow a limited list of, say, half a dozen flavours’. But how do you decide what those should be? There is no way of saying that cinnamon is safer than orange. I don’t see how you draw the line.” Compared with the US, the UK heavily regulates the promotion of e-cigarettes to young people. However, the number of young users in the UK has increased in recent years. A UK Vaping Industry spokeswoman said: “All nicotine-containing flavours are submitted to the MHRA for testing to ensure that no toxic compounds are formed in the process of vaping and we work vigorously to make sure that non-regulated products do not enter the UK market. We work collaboratively with UK regulators to ensure that the highest production standards are adhered to, not only over the manufacture of vaping equipment and liquids, but also to ensure full compliance by our members with the strict rules that forbid sales and marketing aimed at under-18s.”"
170,health,"If coronavirus scares you, read this to take control over your health anxiety","When news of the coronavirus broke at the end of last year, and as the stories from the outbreak became more alarming over time, I found myself wondering how health anxiety sufferers were coping. You see, I used to be one. In late 2015, I suffered a post-traumatic stress disorder relapse which led to debilitating anxiety, much of which was health-related. During that period, I was paralyzed by the thought of becoming ill and dying. I was constantly checking for symptoms and signs of disease online and I was fixated on the health of my loved ones. After treatment, including trauma-focused CBT, I almost completely recovered. But I remember vividly how it felt to be in an all-consuming state of panic. For many months, it ruled my entire existence. Approximately 40 million American adults – roughly 18% of the population – have an anxiety disorder, while in the UK there were 8.2 million cases of anxiety in 2013. There are few statistics about health anxiety, but it can affect those who have an existing anxiety disorder or those who have experienced a life event such as bereavement, birth trauma or an accident. In times like these, where a global pandemic is taking up most of the media conversation, it can be even more difficult to stay calm. Here is some advice that may give some comfort to those of you who are struggling. 1) Avoid the (health-related) news We all want to keep up to date, but when you have health anxiety the need to check and read the latest updates can become compulsive, feeding the anxiety. Try having a news detox, or allocating yourself a time limit for reading or watching news. If you’re really worried about missing something crucial, you can always tell friends and family to contact you in the event of an emergency situation in order to keep you informed. 2) Try not to seek constant reassurance Seeking reassurance can make you feel calmer for a little while, but in my experience, it is always temporary. Your brain creates a feedback cycle where you become increasingly reliant on reassurance, which only serves to reinforce the anxiety. It’s natural to want your loved ones to tell you things will be OK, but when you start needing that reassurance several times a day it’s time to take a step back. 3) Introduce an absolute ban on Googling symptoms Dr Google is not, and never will be, your friend, especially not when you are a sufferer of health anxiety. Nor will message-boards and forums. Try to remember that people visit these places when they have reason to be concerned. Once you start understanding it’s a skewed lens, you’ll be better able to put things in perspective 4) Try a countering technique This is a CBT exercise which involves giving a persistent thought the courtroom treatment, by confronting it with a rational counter-statement. For example, if your persistent thought is something like “Everyone I love will die from this virus” you can counter it with factual statements such as “Actually, most people who get Covid-19 are likely to make a full recovery, and that’s assuming mum, dad and my little sister will even catch it at all.” As my mother always says: “Just because you think something, doesn’t make it true.” 5) Do some exercise Even if it’s just star jumps in your bedroom, or shaking your body parts like you’re in the warm-up section of a hippie acting class, exercise will help get the adrenaline out of your system and channel the panic elsewhere. 6) Breathing and grounding exercises From guided yogic breathing to using a strong smell (I favored lavender oil), grounding exercises can help bring you back to reality. I also found bending over to touch my toes and then very slowly standing up starting at the base of my spine to be beneficial, as it centers me. You can look for examples online, but sometimes, something as simple as sitting on the floor can help. 7) Allocate yourself a daily ‘worry period’ Give yourself half an hour to worry about this to your heart’s content, and then you have to go and do something else. 8) Treat yourself Anything that will give you a little boost can help. It doesn’t need to involve spending money: you can also cook yourself something nice, have a hot bath, or listen to a song you love. 9) Remember that your anxious state isn’t permanent When you are in it, anxiety always feels as though it will never end, but it will. It’s hard to remember this, but do try. I genuinely thought that I would never recover, and now even though we are in a public health crisis, I feel calm and have things in perspective. It’s a worrying time, and many of us, myself included, will have loved ones who might be showing symptoms, but the tendency to jump to the worst-case scenario very rarely reflects reality. Be kind to yourself. It may be a bit cheesy, but this too shall pass."
171,health,"Medical team boards Ruby Princess off Sydney coast to assess health of 1,100 crew","NSW Police’s Marine Area Command has provided an escort for NSW Health and an independent medical team to board the stricken cruise ship, Ruby Princess, off the coast of Sydney earlier Thursday to assess the health of more than 1,100 crew and whether they are infected with Covid 19. The joint operation between Australian Border Force and NSW Police is part of the Australian government’s efforts to deal with at eight cruise ships that are in Australian waters off the east coast and which have ignored an order to leave to their home ports. No police officers boarded the vessel, the police said in a statement. “During today’s joint operation, a 66-year-old crew member was transported from the vessel requiring medical care,” it said. “The NSW Police Force is also assisting with a number of medical evacuations and transfers of Australian crew members from several cruise ships anchored off Sydney,” the police said. NSW Police commissioner Mick Fuller, who is in charge of the cruise ship situation in NSW will provide an update on the evolving operation regarding the management of cruise ships on Friday morning. Earlier in the day the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Australia had an obligation to provide healthcare to people who are sick and within our territorial waters, and that the government would take doctors from a private company to review health of about 8,500 crew, mostly foreigners, are onboard the ships owned by Carnival Cruises and Royal Caribbean. The prime minister said in his midday press conference that the ships off the New South Wales coast had been “visited for the purposes of health checks very, very recently” . The Australian government ordered the vessels to leave Australia waters during the Covid-19 pandemic but they have so far refused to do so and some sick crew members have had to be medically evacuated to Australian hospitals. Fuller has the final say on who can disembark cruise ships. On Thursday morning Fuller said he feared that “bringing 9,000 people off the cruise ships” could “overload” the state’s health system. “We know around the world that when the hospital systems become overwhelmed, then lots and lots of people die.   Related: Coronavirus: NSW government considers military-style operation to test crew on cruise ships off Australia's coast    NSW police also forced another cruise ship, the Pacific Explorer, to leave Sydney harbour and anchor off the coast. Sture Myrmell, the president of Carnival Australia, which operates the Pacific Explorer, said in a statement posted to YouTube that the decision was “particularly sad and disappointing”.  “Being able to send home those crew members who are not required for the safe operation of the ship is the right thing to do both from a humanitarian point of view and Australia’s international standing as a maritime nation that looks after foreign nationals in its care,” Myrmell said. “We remain concerned that it is not safe for the ship to sail away from Australian while there are crew members on board who are ill.  “Australia has maritime obligations to protect the welfare of seafarers and as such we need to care for foreign nationals as we would expect other nations to care for Australians in similar circumstances abroad.” But Morrison made it clear Australia would honour its international obligations to assist the sick in its waters. “If there are people who are sick and need healthcare, then whether it is a foreign national off our shores or an Australian somewhere else, then countries have been respecting that and that is the position of the Australian government,” he said. “That has been respected, that has been honoured, as recently as we have seen in Western Australia with the cases that are there. We are provisioning those ships, so they will be able to move on their way.” Support to reach the ships and process any people evacuated is being provided by the defence forces. A defence department spokesman said: “At the request of the New South Wales government, Defence is planning to provide land-based logistics and additional quarantine compliance at some NSW ports in support of NSW police.” The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said on Thursday that non-Australian residents who were trapped on the ships could be “extracted” and “flown back to their country of origin”. Six crew members from the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which has now had more than 500 confirmed cases of coronavirus, had already been taken to Australian hospitals after falling ill. It remains off the coast of Sydney with 1,100 crew onboard. Doctors from the private company Aspen Medical will be taken to the seven ships off shore – an eighth is in port in Sydney – to determine how many crew are ill with Covid-19. It is then hoped the ships will depart for their port of origin – usually a flag- of-convenience port such as the Bahamas or Malta.  Dutton said on Thursday that if ships were free of Covid-19, then it might be possible to send them out to sea or repatriate crew without risk. But he also accused some of the cruise ship companies of misleading authorities about the health of people onboard. “It’s clear that some of the companies have been lying about the situation of the health of passengers and crew onboard, so what we’ve agreed to do with NSW is to look at each of the vessels,” he told 2GB radio. He said the approach might vary from ship to ship. “Some of these ships will move off and go back to their port of origin, some of them we may be able to extract the crew and fly them back to their country of origin, some of them – because they’ve been out there for more than 14 days – there’s no presence of Covid-19 onboard. Others we do have concern about.” Aspen Medical – a private company that has done work for Princess Cruises, owned by Carnival, in the past – will provide the medical staff. A company spokesman said: “Aspen Medical is operating at a high operational tempo, with a significant amount of work relating to the Covid-19 response, both at home and overseas, including establishing respiratory clinics, emergency departments, infection control training for health professionals and aged care staff and providing screening at Swissotel [Sydney]. “Our involvement in the Covid-19 cruise ship response began in Tokyo, where we managed the land-based quarantine facility for the crew of the Diamond Princess. Following the success of that operation, we were contracted to undertake similar work onboard the Grand Princess off San Francisco,” he said. The details of the contract with Australian Border Force in relation to cruise ships off the coast was being finalised now, he said.  The Maritime Union of Australia has urged the federal government to urgently repatriate all crew members, other than those directly responsible for marine operations, to address the growing humanitarian crisis. That would mean bringing crews onshore and organising charter flights to countries such as Philippines, India and China, where many of the crew originate. But the presence of the novel coronavirus will potentially open up a legal quagmire, particularly if the captains of the ship declare their ships in distress or refuse to leave Australian waters. There may also be difficulties getting countries to accept repatriated crew. Dutton said the Australian Border Force commissioner had already issued directions for a number of vessels to depart Australian waters “and we’re working through that with each of the companies now”. But Dutton added: “We’ve also got to be cautious about the fact that if you force these boats to set sail, and they end up having people die or people who are seriously sick by the time they get a couple of hundred nautical miles off the coast, they’d turn around and come back. So we’ve got to deal sensibly with each of them.” Meanwhile, Labor has accused the federal government of pushing responsibility for dealing with the cruise ship crisis onto the states and called for Dutton, who has been recovering from Covid-19, to be replaced. Labor’s home affairs spokesperson, Kristina Keneally, called on the federal government to take responsibility for solving the “complex” issues, saying they were beyond the capacity of any single jurisdiction to solve. “We have a border security crisis on our hands,” she said. “We welcome the border measures that have come in in recent days but they’ve come too late. More astoundingly, the commonwealth government, responsible for our borders, at the ports and airports, has handed the responsibility for quarantine measures to state governments. “After trying to blame NSW for the Ruby Princess, the federal government has given NSW and Victoria, as well as all other states, the responsibility for implementing quarantine measures at our ports, airports and seaports.” According to NSW Health, 464 cases of Covid-19 had been linked to various cruise ships in the state. The Ovation of the Seas has 74 positive cases, the Voyager of the Seas has 34 cases among passengers and five among crew, the Ruby Princess 337 among passengers and three among crew, and the Celebrity Solstice 11 cases. On the 15 March, Morrison said the federal government would not allow crew ships to arrive, but several cruise ships which had left Australia with predominantly Australian passengers onboard were permitted to land and disembark passengers."

Earlier on Wednesday Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a congressional committee he believed basketball games should be played without fans in attendance while the pandemic is in effect.  “We would recommend that there not be large crowds,” Fauci said. “If that means not having any people in the audience when the NBA plays, so be it. But as a public health official, anything that has crowds is something that would give a risk to spread.”"
173,health,Redefining the 'strong man': Tyson Fury praised for openness on mental health,"Tyson Fury’s struggle with his mental health was ridiculed by his opponent in the run-up to the most anticipated heavyweight title fight in decades. “Don’t you ever forget that when I found you, you were strung out on coke. You were like a big house, contemplating killing yourself,” Deontay Wilder said after an intense five-minute stare-down. 
But for other boxers and mental health experts, Fury’s candid honesty about his struggle with depression and his journey back in the ring is something to be celebrated. 
On Saturday, the 6ft 9in boxer, known as the Gypsy King, will face Wilder in a rematch for the American’s WBC heavyweight title on the Las Vegas strip. Though the initial bout ended in a controversial draw, Fury’s return to his feet after being knocked down shocked Deontay and the rest of world. “Finally got him. I’m celebrating, kisses to the wife …” Wilder later said while rewatching the match. “And then I turn around and there’s the Gypsy King, rising from the dead!”

The remarkable moment has come to represent Fury’s recovery and steered him to become an unlikely champion for mental health. 
Fury spent three years out of the ring due to mental health issues after beating Wladimir Klitschko in 2015 to claim the WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight titles. He battled depression, addiction and suicidal thoughts, which culminated in him nearly driving his Ferrari off a bridge at 190mph. Fury has said he “lost the will to live” and “prayed for death on a daily basis”. 
Dr Benji Waterstones, an NHS psychiatrist working in London, pointed out that suicide was the biggest killer of men under 45, partly because of men’s traditional reluctance to open up. “Fury’s frankness is redefining outdated ideas of masculinity and what it means to be a ‘strong’ man. He shows you can compete to be the heavyweight champion of the world and be vocal about your mental health struggles, which is especially powerful in a testosterone-fuelled sport like boxing.” 
Martin Bisp, who runs the pioneering gym Empire Fighting Chance (EFC) in Bristol, which supports vulnerable people struggling with their mental health by combining boxing and counselling, said boxers like Tyson make a huge difference when they opened up about their mental health problems. 
“Boxers are superhuman, they are the toughest of the tough and they don’t get the credit they deserve when they say mental health affects them,” Bisp said. “These boxers are so important to getting the message out, especially from someone like Tyson, it makes a young person feel less ashamed. They think: ‘Who am I to be embarrassed by mental health when these champions have the same problem?’” 
Waterstones said that Fury’s determination to keep fighting was “busting the myth that those with mental illness don’t recover. He’s been diagnosed with depression, addiction problems and been close to suicide. And yet he’s metaphorically peeled himself up off the canvas.” 
And Fury isn’t alone. David Allen, a British heavyweight, made headlines when he said he pulled out of a fight to deal with his mental health. “They asked: ‘What’s going on, why are you not fighting?’ I said: ‘Look, I don’t feel up to it,’” Allen explained. “It wasn’t something I really mentioned to anyone involved in boxing. At the time, I didn’t want to share it because I felt like it was my own business.” 
While Allen didn’t plan on making any announcement, he is glad he has been vocal about his depression and that Fury is doing the same. “I have felt much better since Tyson’s talking about it. You spend so much of your life living a lie, but there were moments where I wouldn’t leave the house and you become irritating to your friends when you’re a no-show. But now I would say I’m not coming out today and they know why.”

Comments that Tyson has made about women and the LGBT community have, however, complicated his path to rehabilitation. “He’s not had a conventional upbringing and I think he’s a product of that. He holds some archaic views on women and the LGBT community, but I like to think if there’s one thing we know about Tyson Fury, it’s that he has the ability to change,” Waterstones said. 
Allen, who has known Fury for several years, said the media had a habit of building him up and then tearing him down. “No one is squeaky clean, it just depends on how you look at people. I’ve known Tyson for several years and he isn’t squeaky clean, but he is a good man. He is a great fellow.” 
As for Allen, being more honest with the world and himself has given him space to find his own way of managing his depression. “Ive got my own method of dealing with things; lock myself in my house, get food and ride it out. It involves eating loads of Pringles.”

174,health,Remote Indigenous community wins decade-long health battle,"After a 10-year battle by elders and renal health workers in central Australia, the first remote South Australian dialysis clinic officially opened its doors this week at Pukatja (Ernabella), an Anangu community about seven hours south-west of Alice Springs. Seven patients, who were previously living in Adelaide, Port Augusta and Alice Springs for treatment, have already returned home to continue dialysis at the four-chair, two-nurse Purple House centre at Pukatja, 30km across the SA border in the Musgrave Ranges. Purple House is an Aboriginal community-controlled health service that provides dialysis in 17 remote communities and a mobile unit called the Purple Truck, which allows patients to head back home to visit family, for festivals, funerals and other cultural business. The Purple Truck this year trekked to Arnhem Land so that patients could attend Garma festival while receiving life-saving treatment. One of those in the chair at Garma was the actor Jack Thompson. The Purple House began with an auction of paintings at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 2000, when Papunya Tula artists from Walungurru and Kiwirrikurra developed four collaborative paintings that were auctioned with a series of other work and raised over $1m. Since the centre – which is entirely Indigenous owned and run – began, central Australia has gone from having the worst survival rates for kidney disease to some of the best in Australia.     William Sandy and Tjunkaya Tapaya at the new dialysis clinic at Pukatja (Ernabella), South Australia. Photograph: Purple House/Supplied    The Purple House chief executive, Sarah Brown, said the clinic at Pukatja was the culmination of a decade of work by patients, their families and the community. “Ten years ago, Kinyin McKenzie knocked on the door of the Purple House in Alice Springs, homesick for his community and looking for somewhere that would let him boil up a chicken in a billy,” Brown said. “Our directors welcomed him in. While his chicken boiled on the fire, he told us about all the people far from home who were desperate to return to their APY communities, their country and families. “Our bosses, Pintupi people from the Western Desert, said: ‘Poor things. It doesn’t matter that they are Pitjantjatjara, everyone on dialysis is family to us. We need to help them to get home.’” Years later, Purple House had an opportunity from the commonwealth government to nominate places for new dialysis infrastructure. “Our directors quickly suggested Pukatja, even though they didn’t have dialysis in all their own communities at the time,” Brown said. The clinic is named for Kinyin McKenzie and in memory of those who “fought for this service and passed away before they were able to get home”. “But current and future dialysis patients will benefit from their determination,” Brown said. “This is a great example of Aboriginal people working together to make lives better for families in communities.”"
175,health,Australia slashes Pacific aid funding for health as region battles medical crises,"Australia’s aid funding to health programs across the Pacific region has been slashed in the past five years, even as Pacific nations have battled health crises, including a devastating measles outbreak, polio and drug-resistant tuberculosis. Overall aid spending on the Pacific region has increased, with the region getting an extra $214m in foreign aid in the 2019-20 aid budget compared with 2014-15. But new figures, released in response to Labor questions in Senate estimates, show the Australian government has slashed budgets of some programs, including health, in favour of more spending on infrastructure.   Related: 'Dereliction of duty': five charts that explain Australia's approach to foreign aid    Health funding was cut in the Cook Islands by 75%, Fiji by 22%, in the Solomon Islands by 13% and in Samoa, which has been devastated by a measles outbreak that claimed the lives of more than 80 people, by 36%. The government has made much of its redirection of aid spending towards the Pacific region, at the expense of other regions, as part of its “Pacific step-up”, which includes $3bn in infrastructure funding. Labor’s spokesman on international development and the Pacific, Pat Conroy, said health had been neglected despite that emphasis. “The cuts to Australian assistance on health have also hit our Pacific neighbours particularly hard, despite the government’s claims of a Pacific step-up. “Cutting health assistance to Samoa by 36% in the aftermath of its tragic measles epidemic raises questions about whether the Morrison government is genuinely responding to the needs of Australia’s Pacific friends.” The chief executive of the Australian Council for International Development, Marc Purcell, said Australia had traditionally been a leader on preventive health, but “this leadership has been lost” as Australia has reduced its aid health spending by a third since 2014-15. “Given the low resilience of the region against infectious diseases, the recent spread of measles in Samoa and the threat of coronavirus, there are widely held concerns across the Pacific. Now would be the perfect time for Australia to pick up the baton once more,” Purcell said. The broader aid figures showed that spending on individual Pacific nations was patchy, with Australia increasing the amount it gave to Papua New Guinea, while reducing the amount it spent on some of its other, and most vulnerable, neighbours.   Related: Foreign aid declines further in Australian budget, with focus on Pacific    Overall aid spending was cut to the Cook Islands (26%), Fiji (5%), Kiribati (10%), the North Pacific (42%), Samoa (14%), Tonga (10%) and Tuvalu (17%) between 2014-15 and 2019-20. It has remained steady in Nauru and the Solomon Islands. The big winner from the region was PNG, which receives roughly 10 times more in Australian aid than the next largest Pacific recipient, Fiji. PNG got an additional $82m in aid over the past five years, a 16% increase. Australia has dramatically cut its overall aid program in the last five years. In the current financial year, it will spend just 21 cents on foreign aid for every $100 the nation earns, a historic low, down from a peak of 33 cents in 2013-2014 and well below the UN target for wealthy countries of 70 cents. A spokesperson for the department of foreign affairs and trade said: “Australia is delivering an aid program that is affordable and effective – one that is focused on promoting economic development, reducing poverty and enhancing stability, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. ”The Government has reprioritised our aid program to support the Pacific Step-up. Our aid to the Pacific will increase to a record $1.4 billion in 2019-20, recognising our enduring ties with our nearest neighbours.”"
176,health,Jes Staley needs a 100% clean bill of health on Jeffrey Epstein,"If Jes Staley is found to be even an inch out of line in his account of his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, he’ll be dumped by Barclays immediately. Or, more accurately, regulators will make his position untenable. The American chief executive survived one big regulatory investigation when he was judged in 2018 to be merely incompetent (failing to show “due skill, care and diligence”), as opposed to lacking personal integrity, in trying to unmask an internal whistleblower. But the new investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England is different: it’s about whether Staley lied, or was less than frank, when describing to Barclays’ board the nature of his relationship with Epstein. Only a finding of 100% cleanliness will do.   Related: Barclays boss Jes Staley's links to Jeffrey Epstein investigated    The same applies to the board itself since it is backing Staley all the way and the regulatory inquiry also concerns the bank’s letter to the FCA setting out the chief executive’s relationship with Epstein when at JP Morgan Chase. Barclays chairman Nigel Higgins, in post for less than a year, needs a pristine regulatory outcome himself. In other circumstances, Staley would have expected applause from shareholders for Barclays’ numbers for 2019, which showed a 25% jump in pre-tax profits to £4.4bn. The only quibble was the alert that the target of a 10% return on equity might be missed this year. The financial performance, though, is a sideshow. For what feels like the umpteenth time, we’re waiting to see if Barclays’ boardroom is about to spit out another famous investment banker. National energy champion to FTSE 100 relegation in five years Centrica’s decline on Iain Conn’s watch as chief executive has been spectacular and, even in his final months in charge, the bad news outweighs the good. The core British Gas retail division is still getting clobbered by the price cap. Weak natural gas prices are still hurting the exploration and production division. And the 20% stake in outage-prone nuclear generator British Energy is still hanging around more than a year after it was put for sale. A share price that was 280p in 2015 is now 72p and Centrica is worth a puny £4.2bn. In truth, it was always wrong to think of Centrica as any sort of champion. The group contained too many odds and ends, which is why Conn’s strategy of concentrating on the consumer side, and adding “connected home” initiatives, made some sense. The tragedy for shareholders is that Conn’s bet ended up as a gamble on the government staying out of the retail energy market. He lost. When the price cap arrived, Centrica’s fragile financial arithmetic couldn’t stand the strain – Conn calculates the cap cost the group £300m last year. The company found itself locked into countless rounds of job cuts in a futile attempt to protect the dividend. The upstream assets are now being sold at a bad moment in the commodity cycle. Conn is right, though, when he says Centrica’s cash flows now roughly balance after his second cut in the dividend, which is one definition of a “sustainable” business. British Gas hasn’t halted the loss of customers but it has slowed the rate substantially. And the “services and solutions” operation – which spans smart boilers, domestic storage batteries and software for electric vehicle charging – is growing rapidly; it looks a decent business to own on the way to a lower carbon future. That, though, is for the next chief executive, when he or share is eventually appointed. In the meantime, the share price is a hostage to the prices achieved for selling the exploration assets plus the British Energy stake. As with Conn’s exit, their departure is taking ages. Watchdog should launch investigation in to grubby ticket sales The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has already warned Viagogo and StubHub to pause any integration of their businesses while it considers a probe of the two firms’ merger. Here, though, is a strong reason for the watchdog to go further and launch a full-scale investigation: this paper’s revelations about the scale of StubHub’s activities in the grubby business of reselling football tickets. Evidence suggest about 5% of the seats for next Monday’s Chelsea versus Manchester United game have sold or advertised via StubHub, despite a law banning reselling of tickets. There are many other examples. The CMA should take a hint. Consumers aren’t bothered about JD Sports’ takeover of Footasylum, a small deal that fascinates the boffins, but they do care about football tickets."

Rudimentary but engagingly zany, they attracted a substantial if hodgepodge fanbase from body-conscious zoomers to middle-aged mums. So when he brought out the cookbook Lean in 15, five years ago, his publisher said she would be delighted to sell 70,000 copies, which roughly amounted to one per Insta follower. Instead he sold 700,000, to become the second biggest seller in the cookery hall of fame, below Jamie Oliver. This week, though, his live workouts on YouTube have put him in a different league. Every morning at 9am, he is running a “PE lesson”: an exercise class for kids that you can do in your living room. It sounds like a simple idea, but now every child in the country (and their mum) is talking about it, his name forming a compound noun with his chosen title: “Yes, I’ve done my PE homework, I’ve done JoeWicksBodyCoach.” Kids love the kangaroo hops and parents love the fact it gets their children burning off excess energy when they are trapped inside. Skyping me on Tuesday afternoon, Wicks runs the numbers: “On day No 1, we had 806,000 households streaming it. Today it was 954,000 livestreams; 3.7 million people have watched the first video since yesterday. It’s just growing, I’m over the moon. I feel quite overwhelmed by it.” He has been up since seven, and so busy he has only had time for a piece of toast. This is a salient detail from the nation’s ultimate dietary role model, whose MO is to show not tell; normally his lunch is way more balanced.     Let’s get physical … Mia and Jack, two of Wicks’s audience of millions. Photograph: Ian West/PA    He is keen to stress that this is no overnight success. The Instagram videos built up over two years, from 2014 when he was an obscure and incredibly bouncy personal trainer, shaking pans about, being cute about broccoli (“baby trees!”) and wild about rice, to 2016, post his first book, when he had a million followers. He is quite down on his early broadcasts, describing his voice as monotonous and critical of the lighting. “No one that probably really loved cooking, like really skilful chefs, would have watched those,” he says. “They were for general people who wanted to know where to start.” But there was something distinctive about them, an unstudied inclusiveness It was in 2016 that he started visiting schools, up and down the country, trying to embed a passion for physical jerks. He wanted to teach the world to star jump; he wanted a TV show, like Jamie Oliver’s School Dinners but for exercise. He could not get any takers. But that was then. Yesterday, he was in discussions with Channel 4 about streaming his online workouts while the Sun was poring over his videos, trying to spot evidence of a lavish lifestyle from the shots of his living room in Richmond, Surrey. “It’s a very modest house,” he says. “People just focus on the stupidest things. I mean, look: it’s a nice kitchen, but it’s not anything fancy. It’s because I won’t do an interview with them, that’s why.” Hmmm, the last person who said they’d never do an interview with the Sun was a Labour leadership candidate, I say a little slyly. “I don’t do politics,” he says, laughing; his mind is on a larger goal. “I want to be the person who completely transformed the health of the nation.” I do not think Wicks has a particular fitness secret: his workouts are successful because people love him. This is the mystery of the man – why is it that people, across generations, like him so much? It is not a question that you can ask directly. You have to go back to the beginning.    I had quite a chaotic home life, it wasn’t stable, my diet wasn’t great.  Joe Wicks     A disruptive and naughty kid, “a bit of a clown”, he says, Wicks was always into sport, football, cross-country, anything where he could blow off a bit of steam. The defining moment of his teenage years was when, at 15, a group of his schoolmates was taken on an immersion day at St Mary’s University, in Twickenham, London. “I remember looking round the bus, and it was all the naughtiest kids, the ones who were always in detention. I think they must have wanted us to see how it could be different.” On the way home, he rang his mum and announced that he wanted to be a PE teacher – and he did start as a teaching assistant, before becoming a personal trainer. It was not an obvious trajectory, he says. “I had quite a chaotic home life, it wasn’t stable, my diet wasn’t great. I was never an overweight child, but I had behavioural issues. I think that was linked to my upbringing and not having a great start with my nutrition.” His mother was 17 when she had his brother, 19 when she had Joe; his father was in and out of rehab for drug addiction. “There was a lot of shouting, a lot of doors slammed, we didn’t sit down and have dinner together.” And yet, he says: “One thing I had more than anything, I had love and support from my mum and dad. My mum used to say: ‘I don’t care if you become a dustman or a doctor, you can be who you want.’” It is a powerful and unusual stance, and it means he really gets imperfection – human frailty, too much sugar, not enough lunges – he gets that you can make poor choices without being a bad human being, he is palpably non-judgmental, without ever saying: “I’m not here to judge you.” I think viewers can smell that, at any age, even through their smartphones.     Get shorty … Wicks tones his arms. Photograph: Chris McAndrew Photography Ltd/Chris McAndrew    There is also, of course, the impossible to ignore eye-candy element, which meant in his early career he was often seen on the covers of fitness magazines displaying his washboard torso. He is quite uncomfortable about that now. “I am a dad and I am married and I’m very public about my love for my wife [Rosie, who used to be a model]. So the attention has shifted, it’s less: ‘We love him because he’s got abs’, the heartthrob days are over.” Anyway, he says: “I’m 34 now, receding hairline, I’m not as lean as I was.” Which is stretching things a bit, since to the untrained eye, he looks the same, only more famous. But he is certainly serious about his family. “It’s a nice calm feeling, since I got married and had kids [a daughter of two, a three-month-old son]. I’m not chasing anything, I’m not rushing to get anywhere, I’m really content with what I’ve got. When you’ve got a nice house and you’ve got your kids and you’ve got your holiday, what more do you need? There isn’t much more that will ever make you happier than that.” If you have to pretend to be going bald to damp down the passions of a whole nation who refer to you as “Juicy Joe”, I guess that’s a price worth paying. Anyway, back to the fitness; there is a good reason to start with younger kids. Before coronavirus hit, when he was still touring the country, “I went to a secondary school, and they were already a little bit too cool: ‘I’m not training with him, who is this dude?’ My whole philosophy is to get kids exercising at a young age, which you can really create with role modelling. ‘My mum’s sweating, she’s out of breath, she’s laughing.’” Take a sedentary teen, who is into their devices, and good luck training them, he says. This might be disheartening news if you already have a house full of sedentary teens who are all into their devices, but he continues persuasively, and by the end of it I’m convinced that you probably could persuade even older kids, so long as you directed them his way and didn’t try to role model it by sweating yourself. “It’s just about happiness,” he says. “I’ve stepped away from exercise to look good, exercise to lose weight. True motivation comes from how exercise makes you feel. If you’re very demotivated, you’ve got to remember that the sense of achievement comes at the end of the workout, not at the start.”    I don’t think about financial gain. What makes me feel good is parents wanting to exercise with their kids    As much as Wicks proselytises fitness, he is careful to show his flaws. “People like the fact that I’m out of breath when I’m training, or I’ll have a blowout, I’ll do a little choccy run. I make mistakes, I’m constantly learning.” Even though he has had the ultimate social-media start, born on Instagram, raised by Facebook, he hasn’t fallen into the trap of presenting an idealised version of himself, then having to meet the expectations he has raised. “You can put on a front, but people see through that very quickly, and they disengage.” He never sounds censorious, even while he is describing his meal plans for the day – oats and berries, omelettes and salad, vegetable curries in the evening – and sketching out the unutterable wholesomeness of his mood management. “There are days when I wake up feeling flat, I don’t know why,” he says. “I’m not unhappy but I’m not happy. I know, if I feel like that, I’ll go and do a workout and it will lift my mood.” His workouts sail forth on this tide of infinite enthusiasm, which it is hard not to get swept up in. “I don’t know if you believe in the energy and the secret?” he says at one point. I have no idea what this means, so I say that yes I most definitely do. “I do believe,” he elaborates, “that the more you put out into the universe, the more that comes back.” If the positivity is a bit relentless, it is definitely not unthinking. He allows in anxieties: small, medium-sized, vast. He worries whether he is as patient as he possibly could be at the dinner table, about how personal trainers are going to get through this hibernation period when they are all self-employed. “They really need some love. If you can’t find what you want from my channel, type in yoga for the elderly, or pilates for pregnancy: there’s millions of trainers also doing really good videos.” Since he had children, “I have days when I start thinking about the Earth, about pollution, about the sea, about the economic stuff. I’ve started to think about what it’s going to be like in 50 years, and I didn’t used to think like that at all.” It has made him more driven, he says, but not for money. “I’m proud of what I’ve achieved, yes. You have to understand I grew up on a council estate, and back in the day you had tokens for your lunch at school. I didn’t come from a background of wealth, but it wasn’t something I talked about, I still had a good life. And I’m still not motivated to be financially successful. I don’t look at the numbers, or think about financial gain. What makes me feel good is reaching people, trying to change the culture so that parents want to exercise with their kids.”   Related: 'The people’s yogi': how Adriene Mishler became a YouTube phenomenon    I think back to how stung he was when the Sun picked over his living room for signs of poshness. It actually doesn’t look posh at all. He has just moved all the furniture out so there’s room for press-ups, and there is a map above the mantelpiece. “It’s a plastic map!”, he says, mock-scandalised. He asked me at the start of the interview whether I was Zoe Williams the media doctor, and I said no, but I was once invited to give a keynote to the Royal College of GPs, and because of my weird ego, I exchanged loads of emails on my thoughts about general practice, before my Mr said: “It’s possible they don’t mean you.” He has a version of that story, and it’s much better. “My brother got invited to do a speech at an event at YouTube for the Who. He’s a massive fan of the Who, he’s been listening to their music for years. The day before, he thought: “Why do they want me there?” And it was only the World Health Organization.” It’s a signal of how big Joe Wicks was, even before the online workouts, that the WHO wanted his brother, Nikki, who is also his social-media strategist, to talk through how best to improve the world’s health. Even while he is in no way blase about the lockdown – worrying not just about personal trainers, but about people with businesses, families in debt, how we will adapt to not being able to get the ingredients we’re used to, the stuff we thought we relied on – he is constitutionally oriented towards the bright side. “I think the real value that people get from my YouTube videos are these questions. Are you going to feel good today? Are you going to sleep better tonight? Do you want to give yourself the opportunity to feel the best you can?” Well, OK then. If you put it like that …  PE With Joe streams live at 9am UK time on his YouTube channel. "
178,health,Covid-19 in New York: 'We knew the health system would be a frail match',"Jessica Glenza, health reporter When I pictured covering a crisis as a reporter, and I assumed one day I would, I did not imagine it would be from my kitchen table. But here I am. Stuck in a chilly apartment in Jersey City as we all, reporters included, attempt physical distancing. When Covid-19 first struck New York, I would walk to a park near my apartment with a panoramic view of the city, look across the Hudson River, and remember people who were once part of my daily routine: the deli workers, the delivery men, the nurses and doctors. And one day I woke up to hear Covid-19 had reached its grim hand across the water and taken hold of my own community. My city councilman, Michael Yun, died – his storefront served constituents just a few city blocks from my home. Flowers, picture frames and memorial messages were stuck in the roll-down steel gate. His smile was still alive on the awning above the store. The shop was his magazine stand for decades before he became a politician. From this kitchen table, I’ve talked to weeping emergency room doctors, angry nurses and stoic medical residents. I’ve interviewed experts in bioethics, palliative care, health insurance and hospital financing. We all knew that America’s patchwork, for-profit health system would be a frail match against a vicious disease such as Covid-19. But constant calls for reform were often chalked up to politics, and change was always delayed. Now, as a slow and bungled response from leaders in Washington DC continues to hamper any effort to recover, decades of poor health policy have been exposed. Picture this: in 1975, the population of the US was 215 million people. Today, it is 328 million. In roughly that time, the US has lost 567,000 hospital beds, down from 1.4 million, because they were considered inefficient and unprofitable. This was directly related to how people pay for healthcare. As the number of hospital beds fell, emergency departments also closed because they were the only part of the hospital required to treat patients who couldn’t pay. Which, it turns out, was a lot of people. On average, the cost of healthcare per person between 1960 and 2015 has outpaced wage growth by roughly 2.4% each year, according to government economists. We’ve also managed to exclude 9% of the entire population, or roughly 28 million people, from health insurance entirely, with catastrophic potential for people’s finances. Is it any wonder, then, that it is unaffordable for Americans to see the doctor? That, last year, half of Americans delayed or skipped care because of prohibitive costs? That, in turn, those untreated chronic conditions leave people vulnerable to Covid-19? And that the most vulnerable among us, both to Covid-19 and chronic health conditions, are the poor and people of colour? These questions, of course, are rhetorical. Because even as this pandemic leaves us shocked and terrified, the 10,000 horrific deaths in New York City alone are the predictable consequence of a healthcare system that leaves so many people on the sidelines. There are some other people I have talked to in this crisis: people with hope. Many emergency room doctors, nurses and researchers believe Americans may now see how urgent change is, and believe that maybe in disaster there is also opportunity. Ed Pilkington, chief reporter What does a reporter do when they are in lockdown and can’t get out of the house to report? How can you write the first draft of history when you’re not able to witness history in the making? Well, one answer I have discovered, as a Guardian reporter barely able to leave our Brooklyn home (my wife, Jessica, has a brain tumour, so we are being extra careful to avoid infection), is that you join your son for one of his online college classes. One evening, I was drawn into listening to a Zoom panel discussion at Georgetown University, where Felix is in his final year. One of the speakers was Ron Klain, who in 2014 was appointed by Barack Obama to be America’s Ebola tsar. He was asked what he thought of the way Donald Trump was handling coronavirus, and he replied: “The response will be studied for generations as a textbook example of a disastrous, failed effort.” It was like a eureka moment for me. Suddenly everything that I had been hearing and reading – Trump’s downplaying of the crisis, his comparison of Covid-19 to flu, the botched federal effort over diagnostic testing – fell into place. We were living through a historic failure of leadership and governance. That electric realisation set me on the path towards writing a series of pieces tracking Trump’s epic mishandling of the pandemic and its cost in American lives. I may not be able to leave the house, but with a little help from my son’s online classes I hope I have found a way to contribute to our understanding – and anger – about the disaster that’s unfolding here in the richest nation on Earth.     Park Avenue in Manhattan earlier this week. Photograph: Sonia Moskowitz Gordon/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock    Amanda Holpuch, reporter The first time I walked outside in New York City, once people were sheltering in place, I felt an eerie sense of familiarity. New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, was begging Donald Trump to send more ventilators to the city while the president was insisting the country would be back open by Easter. The mix of desolate streets, denial from the Trump White House and pleas from a political leader had happened two-and-a-half years earlier in Puerto Rico, after hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated the island. One big difference was that, in Puerto Rico, I woke up every day trying to get deeper into the island to understand the extent of destruction while phone and internet service were almost completely shut down. Now I’m stuck at home, depending on the phone and internet to let me know what is happening in the city I live in. It makes a big difference, seeing people’s faces and interviewing them in person. I’ve been focused on the economic impact of the outbreak, so I do get a small taste of what that looks like when I walk past closed restaurants and shop at a grocery store where the city building inspectors are limiting how many people are inside. I’m really looking forward to interviewing people in person again.I’m also deeply concerned that, a few months down the line, we’re going to see the same sort of denial from the White House that has followed Hurricane Maria – Trump still hasn’t acknowledged the actual death toll from the hurricanes. Tom McCarthy, national affairs correspondent I’ve been working exclusively from my kitchen table, so all news collection has happened on the phone, by text or online. The challenge is to tell a national story while operating from this island. But working to our advantage, I’ve found, is a real sense of urgency on the part of sources – experts in public health and emergency response. They want to get the message out: we need tests, we need contact tracing, we need equipment, we need leadership, and we need a plan. One public health expert whom I met on the phone last month texts me multiple times overnight; I awake to his links. Then home-schooling for my two daughters begins, with its own set of challenges. Ironically, physical distancing has offered windows into the lives of sources across the country that otherwise would never appear. Before, you had a sense of which sources were likely to know what and which analysts could speak most effectively in a public-facing way. Now you know who has a dog and who yells at their kids, and whose kids yell at the dog. It’s been cheering, that part of it. Nina Lakhani, environmental justice reporter I was a freelancer for seven years before starting full time with the Guardian last October, and so have perhaps found working from home a bit easier than others. Still, staying indoors while the world outside unravels and people suffer so terribly goes against my instincts as a journalist and human being. We’ve all had to adapt. It’s been almost three months since the WHO declared a public health emergency, so what have we learnt? It’s undeniable that coronavirus is not an equalizer, far from it, the communities suffering the worst Covid-19 outcomes in the US are low income households, people of colour and Native Americans - who by no coincidence are the folks most likely to live in polluted neighbourhoods, without access to clean, running water, adequate nutritious food, and green spaces. These environmental inequalities fuel all sorts of health disparities, and Covid-19 has proven to be no different. What’s also clear from my reporting on water shutoffs and food banks, is that mass layoffs in a country with virtually no safety nets, means millions of Americans will now need emergency food aid and help paying extortionate water bills."

  A coronavirus test developed by a US diagnostics company will be available for healthcare providers to order later today. 
  The US government is ramping up efforts to increase its ability to identify the coronavirus and an ongoing struggle to expand local testing has led to criticism. 
  Health officials said earlier today they expect to deliver enough coronavirus tests to public laboratories this week to test about 400,000 people. 
  Officials expect to ship additional test kits to cover up to 1.7m people by the end of next week, US health and human services secretary Alex Azar said.

  Religious groups have issued guidance for worshippers on practices including hand-shaking, sharing hymn books and taking communion wine as the spread of coronavirus intensifies across the UK, PA Media report. 
  Varying levels of precaution have been taken by different faiths in a bid to protect congregations from catching the illness. Quakers have been urged not to shake hands as they would normally at the end of their meetings, while Catholics in some dioceses are being advised not to offer their hands for the sign of peace. 
  Paul Parker, recording clerk for Quakers in Britain, said:  
   
   Like many organisations that hold regular meetings, we have given advice on taking sensible precautions without raising anxiety. 
   Quakers usually shake hands at the end of their meetings for worship, as an expression of unity. But the act of shaking hands itself is not a core part of Quaker faith and there are many other ways Quakers can share this greeting. 
   We have advised meetings that they shouldn’t shake hands in the current situation. 
   
  A spokesman for the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales said dioceses across the country would soon be moving into “stage two” of precautionary measures. 
  This would include suspending the physical sign of peace – a handshake – removal of holy water stoups and shared hymn books, as well as advising elderly parishioners to stay at home. 
  Catering at large parish gatherings where multiple people touch mugs and utensils would also be suspended, as would the passing round of collection plates during mass. 
  The spokesman added that the decision might be taken by bishops in “remote parts of England” to not advance precautions in their dioceses. 
  “No one size fits all and we are between stages, but my sense is that we are probably fast moving towards stage two,” he said. 
  Guidance issued by the Church of England asked “anyone with cold or flu symptoms to refrain from taking communion [wine] from the chalice”, but said there was currently no need for the practice to stop. 
  It added that no pastoral visits should be undertaken to people who are self-isolating but that “phone support” should still be provided. 
  A spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said that much of the NHS advice and an emphasis on cleanliness and hygiene was “in line with Islamic tradition”. 
  In a statement, the MCB said “mosques, madrassas and Muslim community centres should already be following best hygiene practices”.

  The case of community transmission is a man in Cork with an underlying medical condition. He had not travelled to Italy or been in contact with other confirmed cases. 
  He is being treated at Cork University Hospital, which announced it was cancelling outpatient appointments on Friday.

  Ireland’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said the country remains in the containment phase, but warned it is a “rapidly evolving situation” and urged a “national effort” to stymie potential spread. 
   
   Ireland remains in containment phase with just one case of community transmission. 
   Public health doctors are working hard to ensure our containment measures are operating effectively. Most people who become infected with covid-19 experience a mild illness and recover, but it can be more severe for some. 
   However, this will need a national effort. Every individual needs to be aware of how to protect their own health and the health of others. 
   
  The Health Service Executive said in a statement on Thursday night it was working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients may have had to prevent further spread. 
  One of the cases confirmed on Wednesday – a member of a family of four in the west of Ireland – is a health professional, it has emerged. 
  Four of the latest cases are travel related from northern Italy, involving four males from the east of the country. Two are associated with close contact with a confirmed case and involve two females in the west of the country. 
  The seventh case is a male, who the Department of Health have described as being “associated with Cork University Hospital” and that is the first case of community transmission. A risk assessment is under way at the hospital. 
  There are now 13 confirmed covid-19 cases in the Republic of Ireland, as well as three in Northern Ireland - bringing the total number of cases on the island to 16.

  There are 142 Britons stranded on another Princes Cruises ship, off the coast of California, and the passengers are being tested for the coronavirus. 
  The cruise operator said groups of guests and crew were being tested after a passenger on an earlier voyage died and at least one other became infected. 
  It confirmed that 142 UK nationals - made up of 121 passengers and 21 crew - were on board the Grand Princess, which was carrying a total of 3,533 people. 
  There had so far been no confirmed cases of Covid-19 on board, and that fewer than 100 people had been identified for testing, according to the operator. 
  “Public health officials have advised that no guests will be permitted to disembark until all results have been received,” it said. 
  “Out of an abundance of caution, all guests who have been identified for testing have been asked to remain in their staterooms.” 
  Japanese authorities said last week that a British tourist who had been on board another of the company’s cruise ships, the Diamond Princess - which was quarantined in Japan - had died after contracting coronavirus. 
  Meanwhile, it has emerged that three passengers on the Grand Princess’ previous voyage have been confirmed to have the new virus, and one of them reportedly became California’s first fatality from the illness yesterday, after it disembarked hundreds at four Mexican ports last month. 
  US health officials are working to track down other passengers who have returned home, but when Mexican health officials have not yet been notified by their counterparts, the Associated Press reported.

 Britons returning from anywhere in Italy advised to self-isolate if unwell 
  
  People who have returned to the UK from any part of Italy in the past fortnight are being advised to self-isolate if they begin to feel unwell. 
  Previously, the advice applied only to travellers who had visited the northern regions where the first deaths from the coronavirus were recorded, but the government has now announced that the guidance is being extended to cover the whole country. 
  Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, said the move was needed because of the evolving situation in Italy. He told a press conference earlier this evening: 
   
   The situation in Italy means that we have decided it is prudent at this point to move from a geographical area of north Italy... to a geographical situation for all of Italy. 
   The pattern of what people do is exactly the same as before. It’s about people from those areas, except for the cities which the Italian government specifies in lockdown, all other areas, only people who have got symptoms need to self-isolate.

  The number of confirmed covid-19 cases in Australia has climbed past 50, and include a baby diagnosed in South Australia and a tourist in the Northern Territory. 
  In New South Wales, Epping Boys high school in Sydney’s north will be closed on Friday after a student tested positive, and 61 staff at Sydney’s Ryde Hospital have been placed in self-isolation after 56 patients were identified as close or casual contacts of a confirmed Covid-19 case. 
  At Liverpool hospital, 23 staff and five patients have been identified as potential close contacts of a confirmed case. Elsewhere, in Brisbane and Sydney, nursing home staff have been forced into isolation after coming into contact with the virus. 
  The federal government announced new travel control measures affecting South Korea, and New South Wales authorities have said they were trying to contact 70 doctors who attended a radiology conference with a man diagnosed with the virus. 
  Australia’s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, has warned the worst-case scenario for Australia was “millions of people being infected over a period of several weeks”. However, he said the country’s public health systems were well prepared if widespread outbreaks occurred.

  Two major sponsors of Crufts, believed to be the world’s biggest dog show, have told staff not to attend the event – which began today.  
  Pet food firms Royal Canin UK and James Wellbeloved asked employees to avoid the four-day event “unless it is business critical”, according to the BBC. 
  Crufts, which takes place at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, has 20,000 competitors and their pets coming from all over the world. 
  Last year, 27,000 dogs attended the event, with 21,000 competing, including 3,611 from overseas, 413 of which were from Italy.A spokesman from Mars Petcare, the parent company of Royal Canin UK and James Wellbeloved, said:  
   
   As a global business, we have a responsibility to protect the health and well-being of our associates, as well as to do our part to prevent the spread of covid-19. 
   As such, we’ve decided to restrict international travel and not participate in large events until March 31. 
   
  The Association of Pet Dog Trainers said:  
   
   Following an emergency committee discussion regarding ongoing concerns about the APDT’s attendance at Crufts, we have made the difficult decision not to attend this year given the unprecedented and unpredictable situation. 
   The safety of our members remains our priority, and we hope that all our members, student members and attendees will understand. 
   
  Crufts’ organisers The Kennel Club said the event in Birmingham would still go ahead, with “enhanced measures” to protect visitors. 
  Precautions would include hand sanitiser stations at entrances, toilets and catering areas, as well as additional signage. In a statement on its website, the club said Defra had not advised them to cancel the event.

   On the basis of this evaluation, due to force majeure, I decided that the necessary security conditions are not in place for the usual transfer of the European parliament to Strasbourg for the plenary session next week. 
   I have informed the French authorities and have thanked them for their collaboration in the past days. The plenary session will exceptionally be held in Brussels. Parliament undertakes to reschedule a plenary session in Strasbourg in accordance with the treaties.

  Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, has indicated that the huge effort to limit the spread and impact of Covid-19 will soon move from trying to contain it, the first of the four phases of the response, to seeking to delay its transmission and thus limit the number of people who contract it. 
  “We are moving from a primarily contain model to a primarily delay model,” he said. However, many of the tactics remain the same in both phases, such as identifying carriers and tracing people they have been in contact with, he continued. 
  “That pushes the disease further from the winter pressure period, further out from the period when people have upper respiratory tract infections, and it buys us time to better understand the virus and start the research into vaccines and things like that,” Whitty said. 
  Ministers will decide when the campaign to tackle the virus moves officially from “contain” to “delay”, Whitty added. The latter phase is deemed appropriate when health officials and ministers decide the virus is circulating so widely in the community that containment is no longer the right response. 
  The delay phase could involve some of the measures set out in the government’s coronavirus action plan on Tuesday, such as shutting schools, encouraging much greater homeworking and banning large gatherings such as sports and music events. However, Whitty told MPs on Thursday morning that closing schools may only have “a marginal effect” on the spread of Covid-19, because children are not badlyaffected by it.

  Of the 115 confirmed cases across the UK so far, it remains unknown how 10 of them came to be infected, including seven of the 25 who were diagnosed in the last 24 hours.  
  However, tracing the contacts of people whose illness is initially a mystery should reduce that number, officials said.

  Global health experts have said the first death in the UK from the coronavirus is not unexpected and fits in with the pattern seen elsewhere. 
  Prof Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said: “This unfortunate death is not unexpected given the number of cases and given we know that older people with underlying health conditions are most at risk. It changes nothing about the spread of Covid-19 in the UK.” 
  Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: “The first UK death is sad to note, but fits in with the pattern we have seen elsewhere, namely that the patient was older in age with existing health difficulties.  
  “We can expect to see a small number of further deaths in the UK in the coming weeks, as case numbers increase and vulnerable populations become exposed. Infection control and public health measures are particularly important in institutional populations, such as the elderly in care homes.”

 UK patients with mild symptoms are being treated at home rather than in a hospital 
  
  In a major change of policy, some people who are confirmed to have contracted the virus, but display only mild symptoms are now being treated at home rather than in hospital. 
  Of the 115 confirmed cases across the UK since the outbreak began in late January, 18 have recovered, 52 are still being cared for in hospital and 45 are being treated at home, said Dr Susan Hopkins, the deputy director of Public Health England’s national infection service. 
  “We’ve moved to a situation where people have minimal symptoms and they can self-isolate. It’s safer for them to self-isolate in their own homes, with support,” said Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England and the government’s chief medical adviser for the UK. Prof Steve Powis, NHS England’s national medical director, said: “If the symptoms are mild then it’s appropriate for people to be in a home setting rather than a hospital setting.”Asked how the authorities are ensuring that infected patients are staying indoors, she said that all 45 people are displaying very responsible behaviour. “Many are isolating in their bedroom and only coming out of their room to get food and go back in. They are being very responsible.”

  The rise of the staycation is a perennial story. In the past five years, heatwaves, Brexit, the weak pound, overseas terrorist attacks and, more recently, the climate crisis have all boosted UK holiday bookings. This year, coronavirus looks likely to do the same as British travellers swap holidays abroad for a break closer to home. 
  Figures released on 4 March by the International Air Transport Association (Iata) showed that January had the lowest monthly increase in global airline passengers since 2010, when the Icelandic volcanic ash cloud led to massive airspace closures and flight cancellations. Demand for flights increased by just 2.4% compared with January 2019, where year-on-year growth had been 4.6%. 
  “January was just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the traffic impacts we are seeing owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, given that major travel restrictions in China did not begin until 23 January. Nevertheless, it was still enough to cause our slowest traffic growth in nearly a decade,” said Iata’s chief executive, Alexandre de Juniac. 
  Global travel companies are already feeling the negative impact of coronavirus: Booking Holdings (which owns booking.com, priceline.com, kayak.com, cheapflights and momondo.com, among others), is predicting a 15% decline in total bookings in 2020. But UK tourism businesses are reporting a rise of up to 40% in traffic to their websites. 
  “For the period 1 January to 24 February 2020, we are, on average, 40% up on web visitors compared with the same period in the previous year,” said Steve Jarvis, owner of Independent Cottages. “Initial analysis of the most recent enquiries is that they appear to all be domestic – overseas enquiries have reduced significantly.”

 Coronavirus likely to significantly spread in the UK 
  
  Boris Johnson’s spokesperson has warned that the coronavirus was likely to spread significantly. The British prime minister was updated on the coronavirus by the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser as he opened an official Cobra meeting. 
  The PM’s official spokesman said:  
   
   We will continue to try to contain this virus. However, it’s now highly likely that the virus is going to spread in a significant way. 
   Officials will therefore accelerate work on preparations for the delay phase of the government’s plan focusing on steps we can take to seek to delay the spread of the virus. 
   This will include detailed work on the optimum time to introduce further measures.

  The chief medical officers from the different regions within the UK have responded to the latest figures on the coronavirus outbreak.  
  Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said: 
   
   As of 9:00am this morning 25 further patients in England have tested positive for Covid-19. 
   Seventeen were diagnosed who had recently travelled from recognised countries or from recognised clusters which were under investigation. Eight patients were identified in the UK where it is not yet clear whether they contracted it directly or indirectly from an individual who had recently returned from abroad. This is being investigated and contact tracing has begun. 
   The total number of confirmed cases in England is now 105. Following previously reported confirmed cases in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland, the total number of UK cases is 115. 
   
  Dr Frank Atherton, the chief medical officer for Wales, confirmed that a second patient in Wales has tested positive for coronavirus. He said:  
   
   I can confirm that a second patient in Wales has tested positive for coronavirus. 
   All appropriate measures to provide care for the individual and to reduce the risk of transmission to others are being taken. 
   I can also confirm that like the first case in Wales, this patient had travelled back to Wales from northern Italy, where the virus was contracted. 
   I’d like to take this opportunity to assure the public that Wales and the whole of the UK is well prepared for these types of incidents. Working with our partners in Wales and the UK, we have implemented our planned response, with robust infection control measures in place to protect the health of the public.

  The Scottish government has not raised the country’s coronavirus alert status from contain to delay, unlike health chiefs in England and Wales, because the number and type of Covid-19 cases are not yet significant enough. 
  Scotland’s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, said on Thursday morning the number of confirmed cases in Scotland had doubled overnight to six after three people came into contact with the three previous Covid-19 patients. 
  By 2pm on Thursday, there had been 1,250 negative tests according to the first bulletin in a series which ministers in Edinburgh said will be published at 2pm every day. 
  Scottish government officials said there was not yet evidence in Scotland of community transmission involving patients not in direct contact with known carriers or a sufficiently high infection rate to raise the alert from its lowest status, containment, up a step to delay. 
  The delay phase is focused on slowing the virus’s spread through the wider community, and could involve banning or delaying large scale public events, to buy time for medical supplies to be built up and reduce the risks of the coronavirus coinciding with the peak occurrence of routine winter illnesses. 
  Officials said they expected that to change a matter of hours or days. “We’re under no illusion that it’s only a matter of a short period of time before we move it to ‘delay’,” said a government spokeswoman.

  “At the moment we are not complacent, and we can use a lot of experience from operating at pace at different times, whether it is dealing with complex investigations or serious disorder to keep officers and staff available to work,” he said. 
  There are currently three cases in Northern Ireland. 
  “The disease, whilst the dots on the map are increasing, hasn’t yet exploded into the country,” Byrne said. “We are following the advice about personal hygiene, clearly what I need to do with senior colleagues is make sure our preparedness is at its optimum, so we are looking at a range of scenario planning in terms of how we protect officers and staff.”

 Italian foreign minister criticises CNN map

  According to the Italian authorities, the map, featuring a big red arrows sprouting from Italy to other parts of the world, does not highlight other areas struggling with the emergency such as China, Iran, South Korea and Japan. 
  “CNN has shown a map in which it looks as though Italy is the origin of the coronavirus outbreak,” Di Maio posted on Facebook. 
  “This is a distorted vision of reality. CNN is not the issue though, as this is just an example because other international media organisations are portraying Italy the wrong way too. The disinformation of some organs does not clash with opinions but with facts.

  The European Union is assessing the delays in drug shipments from Asia, a senior official from the EU commission told Reuters, as France warned it was overdependent on China with about 40% of the country’s drug ingredients imported from there. 
  The European concerns come as India, which is the world’s main supplier of generic medicines and also relies on Chinese ingredients, decided to restrict some drug exports. 
  “Many active pharmaceutical ingredients are produced in China and the virus outbreak is affecting the manufacturing capacity and stability of the supply of these ingredients,” the European Medicines Agency told Reuters.

  The total number of the new coronavirus cases in Greece has risen to 31, after 21 more people who came in contact with the country’s ninth confirmed case tested positive, ekathimerini.com reports. 
  The figures were revealed in a press briefing from Greek health ministry spokesman Dimitris Tsiodras.  
  The country is moving into “phase 2” of the ministry’s health risk containment strategy, meaning that official measures will focus on containing the virus from spreading from western Greece.

  Egypt has declared its first coronavirus infection of an Egyptian national. The country’s Ministry of Health and Population said the 44-year-old display symptoms after returning from Serbia via 12-hour transit in France. 
  The man has now been quarantined, as Egyptian officials say they have stepped up efforts to limited then spread of the virus, including screenings at airports.  
  Egypt previously declared two foreign nationals had Covid-19. A Chinese national who tested positive in mid-February later recovered, while a 54-year old Canadian national was quarantined last Monday.  
  As recently as last weekend, the Egyptian prime minister and health ministry repeatedly said that Egypt was free of the virus, despite raising suspicions after multiple foreign nationals dreturned from trips to Egypt displaying symptoms.  
  “One trip to Egypt was the source of 11 cases out of 20 people,” in the French town of La Balme-de-Sillingy according to Le Monde.  
  The Egyptian health minister, Hala Zayed, travelled to China this week to discuss the outbreak. She told a press conference that Egypt had tested 1,443 people for the virus, with only one testing positive.

The CMA said it would take enforcement action against companies that charged excessive prices or made misleading claims about the efficacy of protective equipment. 
  The CMA chairman, Lord Tyrie, said: “We will do whatever we can to act against ripoffs and misleading claims, using any or all of our tools; and where we can’t act, we’ll advise government on further steps they could take, if necessary.” 
  Its chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, said: “We urge retailers to behave responsibly throughout the coronavirus outbreak and not to make misleading claims or charge vastly inflated prices. We also remind members of the public that these obligations may apply to them too if they resell goods, for example on online marketplaces.”

  A school in the city of Osnabrück in north-west Germany has sent a convoy of buses and ambulances to pick up a group of 55 pupils and teachers from a skiing holiday in South Tyrol, German media has reported.  
  Two doctors and other medical staff, as well as parents, are part of the group sent to bring the children back, two of whom have suspected coronavirus symptoms. A child with a fever has already been picked up by her father and is being tested. 
  The children are to be separated into two groups: suspected cases with medical staff will travel in one bus, with those considered healthy in the other. The convoy is expected back in Osnabrück on Friday.

  Sally was tested negative last week, but has since tested positive again.David said he “curled up into a ball” and felt close to death after the virus led to pneumonia but both he and Sally were now recovering and gaining “more energy” every day.Asked by YouTube viewers when he would return to the UK, he said: “Until we get a run of negative tests that isn’t even open for negotiation. We have to be given a certificate to say we are absolutely clear of the virus. My gut feeling is probably two to three weeks.”David suspects his room is being monitored by CCTV camera, but he said his Japanese carers had been “so gracious”. And he added that the couple accepted they were being closely monitored “for our own good”.

  DeepMind, Google’s London-based AI research unit, has published predictions of the structure of proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2 [the virus that causes the disease Covid-19], in the hope that they help scientists understand how the new coronavirus functions, and allow for more precise investigation into potential treatments. 
  The company used its AlphaFold system, which applies machine learning techniques to estimate the physical structure of proteins, to generate the predictions, which it has published without the normal, time consuming, review or verification process for such work. 
  “Knowing a protein’s structure provides an important resource for understanding how it functions, but experiments to determine the structure can take months or longer, and some prove to be intractable,” the researchers wrote in a post accompanying the publication.  
  “For this reason, researchers have been developing computational methods to predict protein structure from the amino acid sequence.”

  A “long-term commercial niche” for vaccines to counter the new coronavirus will be opened up, according to the head of a global NGO which acts as an umbrella for drugs researchers. 
  “It’s no longer plausible that containment will be a success and the new coronavirus disease knocked out,” says Richard Hatchett, chief executive of CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations), in a Financial Times piece on the race to find a vaccine. 
  It adds though that, for now, any commercial gain from involvement in creating a successful vaccine is a secondary concern to the drive to find a treatment.

  Full Fact, the UK fact-checking charity, has released some pieces of work countering misleading claims about the outbreak.

  Claim: Scientists believe that coronavirus may have come from bats in a Chinese research facility. 
  Full Fact conclusion: Two Chinese scientists have published an article suggesting that the 2019 coronavirus outbreak could have originated from bats in a laboratory in Wuhan. However, apart from maps showing the proximity of laboratories, they offer no evidence to prove this. 
  Claim: Scientists knew about the new coronavirus long ago and called it “Disease X”. 
  Full Fact conclusion: They didn’t. This is a misunderstanding about the phrase “Disease X”, which the World Health Organization used to denote an unknown serious new disease that might cause a pandemic.

  The real figure will be still higher “because of the fluidity of the situation”, a spokesman said, with the RKI never able to be fully on top of the new numbers as health authorities continue to report new incidents through the day. 
  Meanwhile the government has given pharmacies permission to mix theirown disinfectant solutions with industrial alcohol, in an attempt tokeep up with the unprecedented demand.

England’s warm-up against Italy is scheduled for Wembley on 27 March. The FA is following developments. 
  Premier League and domestic football 
  Widespread disruption already, with multiple Serie A games called off and concerns over completing the Italian domestic season. The Swiss league, Japan’s J-League, South Korea’s K-League and China’s Super League are all on hold, with pre-season International Champions Cup fixtures set for Asia also called off. 
  Olympics and Paralympics 
  Tokyo 2020 officials are sounding defiant but options are being discussed. The events start on 24 July and 25 August respectively; IOC member Dick Pound says a final decision could be made as late as the end of May, with cancellation, rather than postponement or relocation, the most likely outcome. The athletics world indoor championships, scheduled to take place in China next month, are already off.

 German man was first European to contract and transmit virus - doctors 
  
  A 33-year-old German man may be the first European to have contracted Covid-19 and to have transmitted it, Italian daily newspaper il Corriere della Sera has reported, citing a letter of German experts published on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.  
  According to the German doctors, “a 33-year-old otherwise healthy German businessman (Patient 1) became ill with a sore throat, chills, and myalgias on 24 January 2020. The following day, a fever of 39.1°C (102.4°F) developed, along with a productive cough. By the evening of the next day, he started feeling better and went back to work on 27 January.” 
  On 20 and 21 January, before the onset of symptoms, the man had attended a series of meetings with a Chinese business partner at his company near Munich. The business partner, a Shanghai resident, had visited Germany between 19 and 22 January.  
  “During her stay, she had been well with no signs or symptoms of infection but had become ill on her flight back to China, where she tested positive for 2019-nCoV on 26 January,” write the doctors. 
  The woman had immediately informed the company about her illness. Contact tracing was started and the 33-year-old German man was sent to the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine in Munich for further assessment. 
  On 28 January, three additional employees at the company tested positive for 2019-nCoV and so far, none of the four confirmed patients show signs of severe clinical illness. 
  “This case of 2019-nCoV infection was diagnosed in Germany and transmitted outside Asia,” write the experts.  
  “However, it is notable that the infection appears to have been transmitted during the incubation period of the index patient, in whom the illness was brief and nonspecific.”

  The Federation of German industries, the BDI, has warned this morning that the effects of the coronavirus on businesses is likely to send Europe’s biggest economy into recession.  
  Germany’s Robert Koch Institute said that by Wednesday afternoon there were 262 confirmed cases in Germany, with all but one of the country’s 16 states affected. 
  The BDI said economic growth was likely to “fall prey” to the coronavirus. “Economic growth threatens to come to a halt,” the federation said in its first quarter report for 2020. 
  It added that if the coronavirus was not brought under control in countries affected by it, by the second economic quarter it expected a much bigger impact. Germany’s economic growth had already been slower than expected before the virus hit, due largely to the slowdown in China.

  While we reported earlier that North Korea’s leader has sent a letter to the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, offering his condolences for South Korean victims of the coronavirus, observers have expressed fears that the north could be suppressing information about infections. 
  Given that countries with advanced health services are struggling to contain the outbreak, a significant number of infections in North Korea would place intolerable strain on its weak medical infrastructure. 
  “Unfortunately, the international community has no idea if the coronavirus is spreading inside North Korea,” said a recent report by Jessica Lee, an East Asia expert at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a thinktank in Washington. 
  “The fact that we know nothing about the level of infection or deaths within North Korea is extremely problematic and, left unchanged, could have serious public health implications.”While continuing to declare itself virus-free, North Korea has banned foreign tourists, placed people who have traveled abroad in quarantine and closed its 900-mile border with China - a move that overseas monitors with contacts inside the country say has caused shortages of food, cooking oil and gasoline. 
  As the number of cases south of the border dividing the Korean peninsula continues to grow, pressure is mounting on the North to allow international experts to assess the situation there. 
  The UN special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea, Tomas Ojea Quintana, has urged North Korea to “allow full and unimpeded access to medical experts and humanitarian actors, and relax restrictions on access to information. Further isolation of the country is not the answer”.In addition, the US state department has said it would “support and encourage” international efforts to help North Korea fight the disease, despite stringent sanctions imposed on the country over its nuclear weapons programme.

 Cases in Scotland increase from three to six 
  
  Three more cases of Covid-19 have been detected in Scotland among people who have had contact with the previous patients, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to six. 
   Catherine Calderwood, Scotland’s chief medical officer, said the new cases were found in the Forth Valley, Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde and Grampian NHS areas, and were all linked to the three previous cases.  
  “With all these cases, our thoughts are with those diagnosed and their families. Scotland is well equipped to deal with this kind of infection and we are doing everything we can to contain the virus at this stage and minimise the risk to the public,” she said. 
  “Clinicians are now conducting contact tracing, the process of gathering details of the places those who have tested positive visited and the people they have been in contact with.” 
  Calderwood has echoed warnings from elsewhere in the UK that there is likely to be a significant surge in coronavirus cases, peaking in two to three months time. Following Scotland’s first case at the weekend, two further cases were announced yesterday, after more than 850 negative tests for the virus. 
  She said earlier this week that in a worst-case scenario between 50% and 80% of the population could be infected during the course of the epidemic, with 4% of those needing hospitalisation.

 'Highly likely' community transmission ongoing in UK 
  
  There are now several cases in the UK where healthcare officials cannot see where coronavirus infection has come from clearly, whether it is from having been abroad or having been in contact with someone who has, Whitty adds. 
  “That makes it highly likely that there is some level of community transmission in the UK,” he says. 
  “I think we should work on the assumption that it is here at very low levels and we should work on that assumption going forward.”

  British hospitals may currently not have enough respiratory resources to deal with absolutely everyone who would need to be treated in hospital, according to a senior executive. 
  The health service was coping well at the moment, said Neil Dixon, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, whose members provide services to the National Health Service. 
  “Of course there may come a point where the level of infection becomes so great that the NHS and doctors and so on will have to make quite difficult choices about who to treat and when to treat them. 
  “If you take something like intensive care, people make those choices at the moment. The answer is that there will be more of those kinds of choices going forward. Things like intensive care, we have got 4,000 beds, but we will be able to flex that, there will be more, and it’s mostly about giving respiratory support to people. 
  “We can put in many more beds like that, which are sort of intensive care beds, to treat larger and larger numbers of people, but there may come a point where you say: ‘well I am not going to move somebody because, a, the movement itself might be more difficult, we may not have enough respiratory stuff to deal with absolutely everybody, but none of us know.” 
  It was, Dixon added, about getting a balance right in terms of reassuring people, and Britain “probably” had one of the best health systems in the world.

  The British government has hinted it may reverse a controversial decision to withhold information about the geographical spread of the coronavirus. 
  Heath minister Edward Argar acknowledged public concerns about the news that the government would not be releasing information about the location of new cases until a weekly round-up each Friday. 
  Speaking to BBC Breakfast he admitted the government was “learning every day” and was looking at a “tech solution” to allow it to keep the public informed about the spread of disease. 
  On Wednesday, Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer said the government would stop providing daily updates on the location of patients who had tested positive “due to the number cases”. 
  The decision prompted accusations of secrecy and concerns that it would led to the spread of fake news. 
  Argar said: “It’s absolutely right, that we give out as much information as we can.” 
  He added: “What we’re looking at is whether we can find a tech solution that will enable us to do that to keep people informed [which] is hugely important. But to do it in an efficient way that it’s easy to administer and easy to get the information out.” 
  His remarks suggest the government is considering the example of South Korea where phone alerts are available to signify when users come within 100 metres of a confirmed case, based on government data. 
  Argar said: “My boss, the health secretary, is clear that we will report on geographical spread and geographical locations, but there’s a little bit of a lag time because of that big increase.” 
  He added: “We’re going to continue with that geographical information because I think in anything of this sort, and it’s a new disease, we’re learning every day, how it works. Understandably, people will have concerns and questions. It’s important that we share as much information as we can with the public to reassure and to keep people informed. So I think there is a positive from this in terms of public engagement.”

  The US death toll from coronavirus has climbed to 11 as California reported its first fatality and declared a state of emergency over the virus. 
  The death in California was of an elderly man with underlying health issues, who tested positive for the virus on Tuesday and was probably exposed while traveling on a Princess cruise ship that departed from San Francisco to Mexico in February, public health officials said. 
  It was the first death from the outbreak in the US outside of Washington state. 
  The man lived in Placer county, an area north-east of Sacramento, near Tahoe national forest, and was kept in isolation at Kaiser Permanente Roseville. It was the second confirmed case of coronavirus in the county. 
  California governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency over the virus on Wednesday. In a statement, Newsom said he extended “deepest condolences” to those affected by the death in Placer county and that “California is working around the clock to keep our communities safe, healthy and informed”.

  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has said he hopes that neighbouring South Korea will overcome a coronavirus outbreak, President Moon Jae-in’s office said on Thursday. 
  In a letter to Moon delivered on Wednesday, Kim also voiced concern over Moon’s health, and discussed his view of the situation on the Korean peninsula, Yoon Do-han, Moon’s senior press secretary, told a briefing. 
  South Korea is battling the biggest epidemic outside China and reported 438 new infections on Thursday for a total of 5,766. 
  North Korea has meanwhile quarantined hundreds of foreigners in an attempt to stop the virus from breaking out, although other states have expressed concerns about that secrecy and the authoritarian nature of the country mean that it’s unclear how the situation is developing there.

  Greece has reported its 10th case of coronavirus, a person related to an individual who recently travelled to Israel and Egypt, health authorities have said. 
  On Wednesday the government ordered the closure of schools and banned public gatherings in three districts in the west of the country as a precaution after a person from the region tested positive for coronavirus, authorities said. 
  That person had recently returned from a religious pilgrimage to Israel and Egypt. The ban was in effect for 48 hours and subject to review, authorities said.  
  The cases come as Greek authorities react to a developing crisis as thousands of people arrive at the country’s border with Turkey. 
  About 12,500 people are estimated to be waiting on the Turkish side of the Greek border after the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said on Saturday he would open his country’s borders for refugees fleeing the nine-year war in Syria to cross into Europe.

  Funerals of coronavirus victims in Britain could be transmitted to mourners over the internet to prevent the spread of the disease if it becomes a pandemic, the Daily Telegraph reports. 
  The paper says bereaved relatives who have come into close contact with victims would be at greater risk of contracting the illness themselves, resulting in the government seeking to discourage them from holding large funerals. 
  It also cites official government pandemic planning documents which raise the prospect of crematoria being open 24 hours a day, and all week, to cope with up to 50,000 extra deaths per week in the worst case scenario.

 Chinese President Xi postpones Japan trip 
  
  Chinese President Xi Jinping has postponed his state visit to Japan in April due to the coronavirus outbreak, Japan’s government said Thursday.  
  Xi was to have been the first Chinese president to visit Japan since Hu Jintao in May 2008. 
  Xi was scheduled to meet Japan’s emperor, Naruhito, attend a banquet at the imperial palace and hold talks with Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe. 
  The leaders had hoped the visit would underline recent improvements in bilateral ties after years of tension over rival territorial claims to the Senkakus, a group of islands in the East China Sea that are administered by Japan but claimed by China, where they are known as the Diaoyu. 
  Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said the two countries had agreed that their immediate focus should be on containing the coronavirus outbreak.

 Summary 
  
  New infections, panic buying and schools closing continued worldwide, but Japan says the Olympics will go ahead in July.  
   
   The death toll in mainland China passed 3,000, with a further 31 deaths on Wednesday taking the total toll to 3,012. All of the deaths were in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak. Confirmed cases in China rose by 139 to reach 80,409, and reversing two days of decreasing counts.  
   South Korea’s number of confirmed cases neared 6,000 on Thursday. So far 36 countries and regions have imposed a blanket entry ban on people who have recently been in the country’s South, according to the foreign ministry in Seoul. 
   California’s governor has declared a state of emergency after the announcement of the first virus-related death there. The state now has 53 confirmed cases. 
   Italy closed all schools and universities until 15 March and ordered that all major sporting events be played behind closed doors. The virus has killed 107 people there, and spread to all but one of Italy’s 20 regions.  
   Japan’s Olympics minister said the Games would go ahead in July as planned, saying that cancelling “would be unacceptable for the athletes”. The country has 1,036 cases and 12 people have died, its health ministry has said. 
   Australia introduced a travel ban for South Korea and brought in enhanced screening for those arriving from Italy. Australia’s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, has said the government is “looking at scenarios from the most benign through to some millions of people being infected over a period of several weeks”.  
   Germany’s health minister has labelled the outbreak a pandemic, something the World Health Organization has so far stopped short of declaring. “What’s clear is that we have not yet reached the peak of the outbreak,” Spahn told German politicians. 
    Panic buying continued around the world. Masks and toilet paper, in particular, remain in demand.

  Italy’s government is likely to increase the value of measures to help the economy withstand the coronavirus outbreak to to 5 billion euros (US$5.57 billion). Deputy Economy Minister Laura Castelli said on Thursday. “It is likely that the government will reach (5 billion euros)“ Castelli said in an interview with daily Il Messaggero, adding that she thought it was “necessary to raise the bar as much as possible”. Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri has promised tax breaks and other measures for the affected sectors worth 3.6 billion euros. A government source told Reuters on Wednesday this may be raised to 4.5 billion, or 0.25% of GDP.

  Shelves are being stripped bare of toilet rolls, hand sanitiser and surgical masks everywhere from Japan to France to the United States as panic buying criss-crosses the globe with the coronavirus, defying repeated calls for calm and disrupting supply chains, the AFP reports. 
  Australia’s biggest supermarket this week began rationing sales of toilet paper after police had to be called to a shop in Sydney when a knife was drawn in a scuffle over the scarce commodity. 
  On Saturday Japan’s prime minister took to Twitter to calm fears of a national shortage, while social media photos from the US show toilet paper shelves lying bare. 
  Last month ten thousand people queued outside a Hong Kong shop that had secured a shipment of single-use surgical masks, and days later masks were voted the most desireable gifts to receive for Valentine’s Day. 
  In London, masks are now going for more than 100 times their normal retail price, while French authorities said they will requisition all face mask stocks and production. 
  This is despite the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saying it did not “recommend the use of facemasks” to help combat the outbreak.

  A Turkish Airlines aircraft was flown back to Istanbul without any passengers on Thursday on orders from authorities in Singapore after a passenger who had arrived on the same plane on Tuesday tested positive for coronavirus. Singapore’s aviation regulator said that the three pilots and 11 other crew of flight TK54 that had arrived on Tuesday were on the return flight to Istanbul, where they would be placed in quarantine.  
  “The crew had come into close contact with a passenger on flight TK54 who subsequently tested positive for COVID-19,” the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said in a statement on Thursday. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in contact with the Turkish Embassy, which has confirmed that the crew will be quarantined upon arrival at Istanbul,” CAAS said. 
   Singapore’s transport ministry said in a statement on its website that authorities had begun tracing passengers on flight TK54 that may have had contact with the infected person.

  Here’s a wrap on the latest coronavirus news from Helen Davidson and Justin McCurry.  
  China’s death toll passed 3,000, as Germany’s health minister labelled the outbreak a pandemic and modelling in Australia predicted a worst-case scenario where millions could be infected with Covid-19.  
  The developments came as the coronavirus continues to spread around the world. South Korea’s number of confirmed cases neared 6,000 on Thursday and Italy ordered the closure of all schools after the virus spread to all but one of its 20 regions, killing 107 people. The UK has been warned an epidemic is likely. 
  A further 31 virus deaths in China took the number of fatalities beyond 3,000 on Wednesday. All of the deaths were in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak, and authorities confirmed 139 new cases – a rise on the previous day’s total. 
  In the US, California declared a state of emergency over its 53 confirmed cases, and a cruise ship linked to the state’s first virus death was being held off the coast of San Francisco.

  The Australian state of Western Australia has recorded its third case of coronavirus. The woman in her 30s returned to the state this week after travelling to Iceland and London and flying home via Dubai.  
  State health minister Roger Cook, said the state had not yet recorded any cases of apparent on-soil transmission. 
  “Western Australia remains coronavirus free in terms of internally contracted or transmitted cases,” Cook told reporters in Perth on Thursday. “All the cases which have occurred in Western Australia have been those that have contracted the disease outside the state, so our ongoing campaign to constrain and isolate in relation to the coronavirus epidemic is still being highly successful.” 
  Dr Andy Robertson, Western Australia deputy chief health officer, said authorities were tracing the woman’s movements. Robertson said she was not symptomatic on the plane and self-isolated when she became sick. The woman remains in home isolation.  
  The other two cases in the state were a couple in their 70s who contracted the virus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship and were transferred to Western Australia, where the 78-year-old man died. Cook said coronavirus clinics would be operational in the state from Tuesday and the state had spent $2.3m to purchase 50 new ventilators for hospitals.

  Just an update on what Australia’s new travel restrictions involves.  
   
   The government on Thursday banned the arrival of foreigners from South Korea 
   It extended existing bans on foreigners arriving from mainland China and Iran and said there would be tougher screening processes for people arriving from Italy. 
   New travel restrictions mean that any foreign traveller who has been in China, Iran and South Korea within two weeks of arriving in Australia will be turned away.  
   The bans, which include anyone who has transited through those countries, will be reviewed on a weekly basis.  
   Australian nationals and residents are exempt from the bans, but are required to self-isolate for two weeks on their return to Australia. 
   Travellers from Italy will be given temperature checks and required to completed a detailed health questionnaire before they are cleared for entry.

  Most of the staff at a Sydney aged care home at the centre of a coronavirus outbreak did not turn up to work on Wednesday night because they were concerned about endangering their own family members, the union representing aged care workers has said. 
  BaptistCare, which runs the Dorothy Henderson Lodge in Macquarie Park, refused to comment when asked if a number of staff had failed to turn up to their shift after news broke of a Covid-19 outbreak at the facility. 
  But the Health Services Union secretary Gerard Hayes said the union had been told by staff at the facility that “most” of the workers rostered to work on Wednesday night had called in sick and the shift was covered by a work hire agency. 
  Residents at the aged care centre have been confined to their rooms and employees have been told to stay home and self-isolate if they show any symptoms, as health authorities struggle to contain the virus.

  Australian officials have not been able to visit a citizen locked up in China because of coronavirus, and there are concerns for another person jailed in Iran, AAP reports. The global outbreak of coronavirus has prevented Australian consular officials from visiting a citizen locked up in a Chinese prison. There are also concerns for another Australian detained in Iran, where the virus has spread among prisoners. 
  Australian writer and pro-democracy advocate Yang Hengjun has been detained in China since January last year. Dr Yang is granted one half-hour consular visit each month.However, Foreign Affairs official Andrew Todd said his February visit was cancelled by Chinese authorities due to COVID-19 control measures in place.“These same measures apply across all prisons in China,” he told a Senate estimates hearing on Thursday.“We are seeking through our embassy in Beijing with Chinese authorities alternative ways of making contact with Dr Yang, either through a telephone call or through written correspondence.” 
  South Australian senator Rex Patrick asked whether the coronavirus posed any risk to Dr Yang.“Not that we’re aware of at this stage,” Mr Todd said.“It’s an issue that we’re monitoring very closely with all Australian citizens detained across the world, but particularly in countries where there are current outbreaks of COVID-19.”

  As well as advising people to stay at home or in their hotel, including not going to public places, in particular work, school, childcare or university, the government has also issued advice on how to alleviate boredom while in isolation – including doing craft.“Keep in touch with family members and friends via telephone, email or social media,” the advice says. “Exercise regularly. Options could include exercise DVDs, dancing, floor exercises, yoga, walking around the backyard or using home exercise equipment, such as a stationary bicycle, if you have it. Exercise is a proven treatment for stress and depression. 
  “Don’t rely too heavily on the television and technology. Treat quarantine as an opportunity to do some of those things you never usually have time for, such as board games, craft, drawing and reading.”

  It’s well worth a look, especially in light of what Australia’s chief medical officer was saying earlier about the modelling scenarios about how it could infect millions in the worst case.Klassen makes the point that we should use data from South Korea, Singapore and the Diamond Princess to extrapolate how it might spread because figures from countries such as China , Italy and Iran come with question marks. For example, he questions how reliable Chinese data can be when South Korea now has more recorded cases than any Chinese province except Hubei.

  Japan’s Olympics minister said the country is committed to hosting the summer games as planned from July even as the coronavirus outbreak spread to new parts of the country. 
  “Cancellation or delay of the Games would be unacceptable for the athletes,” Seiko Hashimoto said in parliament on Thursday. The minister had caused controversy earlier this week by saying the contract for the games “could be interpreted as allowing a postponement” within calendar 2020.  Confirmed coronavirus infections rose to 1,036 nationwide as of Thursday morning, 36 more than the previous day, according to national broadcaster NHK. It was the biggest one-day increase to date, with new cases in locations ranging from Kumamoto prefecture in the southwest to Hokkaido in the north.

  The Australian toilet paper-buying urge is strong even for two Australian behavioural scientists

  Liam Smith and Celine Klemm write, “Humans are finely attuned to monitoring what everybody else is doing (even subconsciously). Most of us use ‘what other people do’ as a mental shortcut to decide on what the appropriate behaviour would be if we are unsure. It’s a simple decision mechanism called ‘social proof heuristic’, a concept popularised by psychologist Robert Cialdini. For instance, we litter more when the surrounding environment is littered, because it signals to us that littering is the norm. Hotel guests are also more likely to reuse their towels if told that ‘the majority of guests reuse their towels’. So, when we see people stockpiling toilet paper, the natural reaction is to do the same. Social proof can help decide how to act, or reassure us that we are taking the right action.”

  #ToiletPaperEmergency or the great #ToiletPaperApocalypse, as it has been dubbed on Twitter, has already rolled out hundreds of memes, witty asides as well as documented the madness of people stockpiling the toilet essential. 
  In the real world it has led to Australian toilet paper manufacturers ramping up production to keep up with demand from people fearful of coronavirus. 
  One newspaper has gone one step further by printing extra pages in its editions to help out those who have been … caught short.

  We have a bit more information about the latest cases from South Australia, from a press conference given at the Royal Adelaide hospital a short time ago. 
  Two people, a baby and a 58-year-old man, tested positive to Covid-19 on Thursday, bringing the total number of cases in South Australia to seven. 
  The public health physician, Dr Nicola Spurrier, said the baby girl was the daughter of a 40-year-old woman who was hospitalised in Adelaide’s Flinders Medical Center on Wednesday after testing positive for the virus. The woman arrived in Adelaide from Iran via Kuala Lumpur on Sunday.  
  “The little bub, the child of the mother that is currently in Flinders Medical Centre has tested positive but I am very pleased to report that the child is well and both mother and baby are doing well in that facility,” Spurrier said. 
  The 58-year-old man, from Taiwan, arrived in Adelaide on Tuesday and was taken to the Royal Adelaide hospital to be isolated on Thursday. 
  Spurrier said authorities were also tracing any possible contacts that a 24-year-old South Australian woman, who returned from Europe on Sunday and had travelled through Italy, may have made since returning to Adelaide. That woman tested positive on Wednesday. 
  “There are a number of places that that young woman visited before she had the test results and we are all following through on those potential places,” Spurrier said.

  A group of Italian tourists tried to escape coronavirus confinement in Mauritania but were caught and sent back to their home country, the West African country said Wednesday. 
  The 15 tourists arrived in the capital Nouakchott on Saturday planning to travel to the northern tourist hub of Atar, health ministry spokesman Abdelkader Ould Ahmed told AFP. 
  But Mauritania has imposed a confinement period on travellers from countries considered to be a high coronavirus risk – including Italy, which has Europe’s most cases with more than 3,000 as well as 107 deaths. 
  Italy’s foreign ministry confirmed that the tourists had since all returned home, “assisted by our diplomatic network”. 
  The Mauritanian spokesman said the confinement rules applied to “all travellers from risk areas, without distinction”. 
  He added that this “rigour has paid off” as the country has yet to register a case of coronavirus.

  Hong Kong authorities have warned people to avoid kissing their pets, but also to not panic and abandon them after a dog repeatedly tested “weak positive” for coronavirus. 
  The Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department said experts unanimously agreed the results suggested the dog had “a low-level of infection and it is likely to be a case of human-to-animal transmission”. 
  The Pomeranian’s owner was infected with Covid-19 but the dog itself was not showing symptoms, authorities said.

  President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday that while the virus has spread to almost all of Iran’s 31 provinces, the country will get through the outbreak with a “minimum” number of deaths, Reuters reports.  
  “This disease is a widespread disease,” he said during a Cabinet meeting, according to the official presidency website.  
  The health ministry said on Tuesday that 92 people had died so far from coronavirus, one of the highest death tolls outside China where the epidemic originated late last year. It said 2,922 people had been infected with the disease. 
  Among those infected is first vice president Eshaq Jahangiri, the IranWire news site reported, citing an “informed source”. There was no immediate confirmation from officials. Several Iranian officials have come down with coronavirus and one senior official died from an infection on Monday. The Islamic Republic has cancelled Friday prayers in all provincial capitals this week because of the coronavirus outbreak, state television reported on Wednesday.

  Flybe, Europe’s largest regional airline, has collapsed into administration less than two months after the government announced a rescue deal. 
  The impact of the coronavirus on flight bookings proved the last straw for the Exeter-based airline, which operates almost 40% of UK domestic flights, as the government stalled on a controversial £100m loan. 
  Stronger airlines are likely to follow.

  Donald Trump sought to shift blame on to the Obama administration for a nationwide coronavirus test kit shortage. 
  The president on Wednesday blamed a federal agency decision during Barack Obama’s presidency, which Trump said made it harder to quickly roll out testing for the virus. 
  “The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we’re doing, and we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more accurate and rapid fashion,” he told reporters during a White House meeting with airline executives, whom he had called to discuss the economic effects of the outbreak. 
  “That was a decision we disagreed with,” he said. “I don’t think we would have made it, but for some reason, it was made.”

  Ray Dalio, one of Wall Street’s highest profile hedge fund bosses, has described the coronavirus as “one of those once in 100 years catastrophic events” that will hit companies with large debt levels the hardest and potentially lead to a significant economic downturn. 
  The founder of Bridgewater Associates, a fund with $160bn in assets, said the crisis could be broken into three parts: 1) the virus, 2) the economic impact of reactions to the virus, and 3) the market action. 
  The market website Livewire has posted excerpts from his comments on Linkedin.  
  Dalio says that the US Fed’s rate cuts – and similar actions by other central banks from Australia to Canada – won’t do much to boost demand, although they might “goose risky asset prices a bit”. 
  “That’s true in the US. In Europe and Japan, monetary policy is virtually out of gas so it’s difficult to imagine how pure monetary policy will work. In Europe, it will be interesting to see if fiscal policy stimulations can pick up in this political environment.”

  In China, a 36-year-old man who had been confirmed to have the virus and was discharged from a hospital in Wuhan on 26 February has died, according to the Chinese publication the Paper, who cited his wife. The man suddenly became ill on 2 March and died after going to the hospital. The cause of death was respiratory failure caused by Covid-19. 
  China has been noting daily increases in the number of people “cured” or discharged from hospitals after being confirmed to have the virus. But, after several cases of released patients testing positive again, authorities in Hubei ordered that released patients be quarantined for another 14 days. Beijing Ditan Hospital in Beijing has meanwhile found that a patient who tested positive for Covid-19 has suffered viral encephalitis caused by the virus, adding to evidence the infections can cause damage to patients’ nervous systems.

  It “may well be possible within a matter of days or weeks to be able to ensure that we can deal with that,” he said, but for now the travel ban was “the way to go”.

  Murphy said the government is “looking at scenarios from the most benign through to some millions of people being infected over a period of several weeks.”  
  Scott Morrison then jumped in to say the government had “been careful not to be speculative about this in the public domain. What we have done all the way through this global health crisis, I think, is to be very candid and up front and we will continue to do that but what we won’t do is be speculative, because we’re not in the position of creating unnecessary anxiety.”

  Stephens also said it was unclear how long it would take for a test undertaken in a remote community to reach the state’s only available Covid-19 testing laboratory in Darwin, meaning diagnosis could be delayed if a case were to occur in remote NT. 
  She said a Remote Health Pandemic Plan will be released by Monday. 
  The government’s current advice says that anyone who may have come into contact with the virus should seek accommodation within three hours of major municipalities in the state, and not visit or return to a remote community, even if they live there.

  Germany’s health minister, Jens Spahn, said Wednesday the coronavirus outbreak has become a pandemic – defined as an epidemic that spreads throughout the world through local transmission, AFP reports.  
  “The coronavirus outbreak in China has become a global pandemic,” Jens Spahn told German lawmakers. 
  The World Health Organization has so far stopped short of declaring a pandemic, though has said the world must prepare for the possibility. 
  “What’s clear is that we have not yet reached the peak of the outbreak,” Jens Spahn told German lawmakers. 
  The virus has reached 81 countries and territories around the world, with South Korea, Iran and Italy emerging as hotspots outside China.

  Welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus. More than 100 people have now died in Italy. As the virus spreads further across Europe, schools and universities are closing, large events are being cancelled, and the economic outlook continues to be grim.  
   
   The Italian government has ordered the closure of all schools and universities until 15 March, as 28 more people die in 24 hours.  
   The UK has seen the biggest daily increase recorded to date, with the number of coronavirus cases jumping by more than 60% to 87 case.  
   India is restricting the export of several drugs, including paracetamol and antibiotics, leading to fears of a global shortage of essential medicines.  
   The IMF has torn up its growth forecasts. The fund has warned this year’s growth will be lower than last year’s.  
   Concerts, conferences and sporting events are being cancelled in countries around the world. MGM Universal has also announced the postponement of the release of the new James Bond film, No Time to Die.

180,health,Stop smoking campaign in England axed after health budget cuts,"The government has been accused of undermining its ambition to make England smoke free after an anti-smoking campaign was cancelled following a 24% cut to the public health marketing budget. 
Health Harms, a Public Health England (PHE) scheme, has previously sought to harness new year resolutions in January to encourage the 6 million tobacco smokers in the country to quit through vaping and visualising how cancer-causing chemicals and tar are inhaled. 
Rates of smoking are declining, also thanks to the introduction of plain packaging and tax increases, but the government has been urged not to be “complacent” after it emerged the overall anti-smoking budget had been reduced to £3.8m from £5m.

The move came after PHE’s marketing budget was cut by a fifth earlier this year, from about £35m to £28m. 
“Slashing budgets for these campaigns is a foolhardy decision which not only lets down smokers who are looking to quit but will also result in further pressure on the NHS due to smoking-related illnesses,” warned British Lung Foundation’s (BLF) senior policy officer Rachael Hodges. 
“Although smoking rates are declining, we must not be complacent. Mass media campaigns are vital in encouraging smokers to quit and stay smoke free.” 
The charity added the drop in funding “undermines the government’s aim to make England smoke free by 2030” since “mass media campaigns are essential in helping people quit”. 
It said PHE’s 28-day “Stoptober” campaign had resulted in fewer successful quit attempts after less advertising coverage on TV and radio. 
The rate of successful attempts to quit fell from 8% of all smokers in 2015 to 6% in 2016 after spending on media messaging was reduced from £3.1m to £390,000, according to the charity. 
Overall, the Stoptober campaign is believed to have led to almost 2 million attempts to quit since 2012 and the BLF said there was evidence showing stop smoking campaigns were effective in helping people kick the habit. 
Around 78,000 people in the UK die as a result of smoking each year, making it one of the country’s biggest causes of death and illness. Many more live with debilitating smoking-related illnesses such as cancer, heart disease and pneumonia. 
The BLF urged the Treasury to “reinstate comprehensive funding for both Stoptober and the January Health Harms campaign”, saying smoking “costs society more than £11bn per year” of which “£2.5bn falls directly on the NHS”. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
In the September spending review the chancellor, Sajid Javid, announced an unspecified “real terms increase to the public health grant budget”. 
It followed sustained cuts which caused spending on public health services by councils to fall 8% from 2013/14 to 2017/18, leading to “dramatic” changes in the availability of stop smoking services, according to Action on Smoking and Public Health. 
“Within the available money, campaigns have been reprioritised, with the agreement of ministers – with an emphasis on the best start to life, continuing to tackle tobacco harm, raising awareness of the symptoms of cancer, tackling antimicrobial resistance and promoting good mental health,” PHE’s chief executive, Duncan Selbie, said. 
The government agency said the eradication of smoking and the realisation of a smoke-free society remained a focus. 
It previously warned that smokers were “disproportionately represented in the poorest, oldest and the most challenged groups” and is responsible for a “significant proportion” of the inequality in health outcomes between rich and poor."
181,health,'Yellow bindis' mean high-risk: India's new health map for women and children,"It’s 10am and time for the first home visit of the day. After consulting a colour-coded map on the wall of the village centre, the three female health workers make their way through the winding lanes of a remote village in Jhalawar district, Rajasthan, where the rice has been harvested and garlic is being planted, to the home of Nirmala. The yellow bindi (dot) on the map indicates that Nirmala and her children are highly likely to become malnourished without the proper care, which means the family is a priority for health services. The three women tell Nirmala how important it is to breastfeed her newborn daughter, as she rocks her in a hammock made from a sari strung from the roof of her shack. Then they explain the importance of eating well and that her 18-month-old daughter must continue to receive extra food rations; she weighed only 1kg (2.2lbs) when she was born. Finally, they tell Nirmala the date of her next immunisation. All this information has been loaded onto a tablet and is easily accessible to health workers via an app. It’s a smooth process, but it wasn’t always so.   Related: This porridge is just right: homemade baby food that's big business in India | Amrita Gupta    Four years ago, Lata Nayar, an auxiliary nurse midwife, Vimla Gochar, a nutrition adviser, and Manju Suman, a volunteer trained in maternal and child health, worked separately. They didn’t share data about high-risk women and children and each reported to a different department and recorded their own information in the columns of bulky registers. As a result, vulnerable women and children fell through the cracks. High-risk pregnancies were not monitored. Underweight children who were entitled to extra food rations failed to get them because they hadn’t been identified. Today, however, all the data is compiled in one place and is easily accessed by the health workers on an app. All three women are aware in real time of any changes and updates, and all can take action to address or prevent problems, reducing maternal and child deaths. Launched in Jhalawar, in Rajasthan state, by the Antara Foundation in 2015, the integrated programme, known as Akshada, focuses on the crucial 1,000 days between conception and the second year in a child’s life. “They [the women] used to start in one area of the village and work sequentially, going from one house to another rather than first visiting the women and children who are most at risk. That meant delays. The key to reducing mortality is to identify the women and children and reach them fast,” says Ashok Alexander, founder of the Antara Foundation.     A map helps health workers to identify which homes are highest priority. Photograph: Amrit Dhillon    He suggested health workers draw a map of the villages in which they work and colour code the homes to indicate which families are most at risk. “In one glance at the map, we know who to target,” says Gochar, sitting on the floor of the health centre. “Before, it could be weeks before we reached a high-risk pregnant woman. That cluster of yellow bindis are the homes of families who migrate for work. It’s hard for them to be regular in getting their children immunised or for pregnant women to get checked. We keep special track of them.” Maps have now been used in 1,500 villages in Jhalawar district and the app in 150. The strategies have turned health workers into a unified force, and increased their effectiveness. Based on monitoring data collected from a sample of more than 10% of villages in Jhalawar district, the identification of high-risk pregnancies increased by 60%, while the number of children under five identified as underweight increased by 117%.  As Nayar, Gochar and Suman walk around the village children shout: “Auntie, have you come to give us an injection?” A woman struggling under the weight of cattle fodder carried on her head stops them to ask when her child’s next immunisation is due. At the home of Phoolbati, 24, who is pregnant with her third child, the health workers check that she is eating as well as her limited resources permit, and if she is receiving the special nutritional supplement given to pregnant women.     Pregnant women, such as Phoolbati, are advised on nutrition by health workers. Photograph: Amrit Dhillon    “Women generally listen. The only instruction they cannot follow is rest. Often they are rushed into the delivery room straight from working in the fields,” says Nayar. She adds that when women find out their house is colour-coded yellow, “they are eager to get it removed as fast as possible by doing whatever we tell them”. Encouraged by the initial findings, the foundation extended the project to the adjoining Baran district. It caught the attention of the Rajasthan government and is now being rolled out across 46,000 villages in the state, with more than 11 million beneficiaries. The Antara Foundation is now also working in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, where the project is expected to reach more than 26 million women and children in the next four to five years, says Alexander. “We are collecting the data from these states so that we can influence the national health policy,” Alexander says."
182,health,Guardian Public Service Awards: public health and wellbeing winner,"Sandwell council: the Blue Light project When people with an alcohol dependence are in the depths of despair, they can sometimes be quite suspicious of support. They may be suffering from complex physical and mental health problems compounded by other social issues. Gaining the trust of those with a drinking problem can be a battle. But the Sandwell Blue Light project is breaking through these challenges and changing lives. Developed by Sandwell metropolitan borough council in 2015, the project has created a new system that identifies, engages and then builds a long-term rapport with the most difficult to reach drinkers. This includes those who do not engage with treatment, who are regular users of NHS services, or others involved in criminal behaviour. While there were existing alcohol services in place in the borough, resources were limited and there was a risk people could fall through the net. With this in mind, the Blue Light project set out to ensure that people in need had access to an engaging, non-judgmental support system. The project brings together a cross-section of partners, including public health professionals, the ambulance and probation services, and the police. Local GPs, mental health specialists, alcohol treatment providers and other NHS professionals are also on board. The team coordinates its own work, identifying those having the greatest difficulties with alcohol in Sandwell, and develops jointly-owned action plans to provide them with support. Team members talk regularly to ensure they identify and monitor any clients at high risk. For example, a probation officer may have a phone call with a local GP to share information about a drinker’s risk and vulnerability. Every month, the team meets to review and assess client progress and agree on the next steps they can take to help. Lisa McNally, the director of public health for Sandwell, says the project does not define people by antisocial behaviour. Instead, it looks to root causes. “Unless we get past people’s behaviours and look to see what’s driving them to continue to drink year on year, and not engage with services, we will never get anywhere,” she says. She describes one man in his late 40s who was recently supported by the team. He was phoning the police several times a day and showing clear signs of distress. The Blue Light project visited the man and found he had physical health problems and some signs of brain damage. He had been the victim of domestic violence from his partner over several years – she would put cigarettes out on him, hit him around the head or have him beaten up by others. When the Blue Light project got to the root of his problems and coordinated with other agencies, it was able to support him on a path to recovery. “We asked: ‘Why is he feeling the need to escape life every single day?’” says McNally. “Once we start dealing with the issues that may lead someone to start drinking, such as unstable accommodation, a breakdown of a relationship, difficulty with the law or other issues, we can start to see a full picture.” The Blue Light project began with the involvement of 11 councils or agencies, with local staff and service users in each area contributing their expertise. Since then the model has been adopted by a number of other local authorities across England and Wales. The project started with minimal resources, yet has delivered savings of up to £150,000 for local emergency services. To date, more than 40 people have benefited from its support. Of that number, 18 are receiving ongoing harm reduction and risk-management help, while others have reduced their alcohol consumption and found stable accommodation and employment. The project is keen to dispel the myth that nothing can be done for those with an alcohol problem, because they “don’t want to change”. It believes that while it may be unable to change somebody completely, it can at least reduce the harm and manage the risks they pose to themselves and others. “It’s easier for people to forget these people exist,” says McNally. “But we work to wrap full support around the person. Our aim is to leave no one behind.” Public health &amp; wellbeing runners-up South-west London and St George’s mental health NHS trust: Merton Citizens In our modern, disconnected world, it can be hard for residents to keep close ties with their neighbourhood. And while locals in the London borough of Merton look out for each other, they could see a gap in how institutions were supporting residents.     South-west London and St George’s mental health NHS trust held a mental health symposium for local schools. Photograph: South west London and St George’s mental health NHS trust    So an alliance of 14 faith, education and community organisations got together to set up the charitable initiative Merton Citizens. In 2017 it conducted more than 11,000 conversations with residents to establish what issues were important to them. Mental health was seen as a top priority. The programme has since lobbied local councils to improve funding for mental health services and activities, and has had huge success: £1.85m funding has been awarded to provide 25,000  young people with mental health support in local schools; 1,500 people have been trained in mental health awareness; and it has held its first ever mental health symposium for local schools. The programme is also inclusive, working closely with the Muslim community in the borough. Ranjeet Kaile, its director of communications, says mental health was a universal issue. “There was just this sense of commonality that in spite of all our differences, here was an issue that affected many people, and that we could do something about,” he says. A crucial part of the initiative’s success is simply listening to locals. “What’s been beneficial is that people who are affected by the issue talked to us about their experiences directly,” says Kaile. “It’s been important to keep their voice at the heart of it.” The 2025 Movement, North Wales: tackling health inequality In North Wales, those living in areas of higher deprivation are likely to die up to 13 years earlier than others living elsewhere in the region. This injustice drove a small group of people to set up the 2025 Movement, a partnership between like-minded organisations and individuals all working towards the goal of ending avoidable health inequalities.     Jo Seymour, project manager (left), and Karis Price (right) of 2025 Movement partner Warm Wales, with a resident during a Healthy Homes visit. Photograph: Philjp/The 2025 Movement    The collective involves more than 500 people and organisations from multiple sectors, including health, education and housing. By having clear, open communication, the movement can identify issues, think creatively about solutions and create maximum impact. Its “Just Do” teams deliver projects designed to improve health and wellbeing. For example, in Gwynedd, a team met rough sleepers to identify barriers to accessing health services. As a result, rough sleepers are now offered flu vaccinations, given information about how to access emergency dentistry and have better access to mental health services. While the movement has a goal to eradicate avoidable health inequalities by 2025, members understand it is a long-term partnership about systematic change. And as the impact of austerity in Wales grows deeper, Nina Ruddle, the head of public policy engagement at Wrexham Glyndŵr University, says tackling a complex challenge could not be achieved by a single organisation. “What we’re doing is different,” she says. “Instead of working in isolation, we came together from a range of backgrounds to have a bigger impact. We want to grow and develop the movement to change lives in our region – and we’ve got a brilliant group of people that can take that forward.”"
183,health,Australian doctors warn of overwhelmed public health system in event of coronavirus pandemic,"Australia potentially faces widespread Covid-19 infections doctors say, warning that chronically overstretched public health systems could be overwhelmed in the event of a severe pandemic. Up to 70% of Australians could be infected in the event of a severe pandemic, though governments and health professionals have stressed that most healthy people will only experience the illness as a mild to moderate cold. Globally, there have been more than 83,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, leading to more than 2,800 deaths. The vast majority of infections and deaths have been in mainland China, though fast-spreading outbreaks have emerged in Iran, South Korea, and northern Italy. Government plans contemplate successive waves of pandemic reaching Australia and spreading throughout the community. Quarantine, self-isolation and social distancing measures could be encouraged or enforced in order to slow the spread of the virus through the community. Prof Raina MacIntyre, head of the biosecurity program at the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales, said sustained transmission may result in anywhere from a quarter to 70% of the Australian population being infected. Covid-19 – the disease caused by the Sars-CoV-2 virus – has a case fatality rate of between 2-3%.   Related: Disrupted flights and travel insurance: how the coronavirus is affecting travel for Australians    “To put it in context, the case fatality rate of the 1918 flu pandemic was 5%, and the 2009 pandemic, 0.01%,” said MacIntyre. “So, a case fatality rate of 2-3% is high. In China, we know that in addition to the people who died, 5% needed to be in ICU and 14% needed a hospital bed.” MacIntyre said Australia had done an excellent job, so far, of preventing sustained transmission in the country, but that the country was now moving to the next phase of response: managing a pandemic outbreak. “If 50% of Australians – 13 million people – became infected that is up to 400,000 people dying, almost 2 million people needing a hospital bed and 650,000 people needing an ICU bed. “These are total numbers over the whole epidemic, which may last one year.” Australia’s chief medical officer, Dr Brendan Murphy, said Australia was well-prepared for the potential outbreak of Covid-19 in the wider community. “We have accepted the very strong likelihood we will get further cases and some further transmission of this virus in Australia,” he said. “We are still contained in Australia. We do not have any evidence whatsoever of community transmission in this country. Whilst we are preparing and we are realistic about what might come in future weeks. We are not in a situation where anyone needs to be concerned.” Murphy said more than 80% of Covid-19 patients had a “very mild illness” and in Australia, now “nobody should go around wearing and wasting face masks”. Australia has stockpiled 20m face masks in the event of widespread a outbreak. “We are not wanting the community to panic, but we are obviously being transparent in that we think the situation does mean it is very likely we will get some more cases in Australia in coming weeks,” Murphy said. Raina said in Sydney, there were an estimated 16,000 public hospital beds, and 6,000 private beds. “We have previously modelled the number of daily beds required in an epidemic scenario for a different infection, which shows that capacity for beds could be rapidly exhausted in a severe epidemic.” Part of the pandemic plan “activated” by the Morrison government on Thursday – of which some elements were already in operation – involved preparing “surge capacity” in hospitals, including dedicated fever clinics, for the possibility of a high number of cases presenting. This was met by warnings from doctors that hospitals – and medical staff within them – were already operating at capacity, and there was no room for any additional surge. “Part of the pandemic plan is ‘hospitals opening their surge capacity’. Now, I don’t want to alarm anyone, but there is no surge capacity. It’s all open ... we are full everyday. We’ve been saying this for years,” past president of the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, Dr Simon Judkins said.   Related: Doctors and nurses at Melbourne hospital racially abused over coronavirus panic    “That capacity will be created through other means [cancelled surgery/outpatients] But, there are no excess beds or staff. If there were, our EDs wouldn’t be bursting, our ambulances ramping, and our staff burning out. “Australia’s health system will manage this well, due to the hard work of healthcare workers. My point is that we operate our system at or over capacity and to pretend there is ‘surge capacity’ is wrong.” The Australian government’s plan – the health sector emergency response plan for Covid-19 – involves an escalating series of responses, from self-isolation of suspected cases, enforced quarantining of known infectious patients, up to the closure of schools, cessation of public transport and advice – even orders – for people to work from home. Under complementary state government pandemic plans: sports stadia may be sequestered as quarantine sites, police could be ordered to guard critical medical supplies, and governments may order entire suburbs, cities or groups of people to undergo mass vaccinations (once a vaccine is developed). Prof Nigel McMillan, director in infectious diseases and immunology at Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University said many pandemic models of the disease’s spread were inaccurate because “we don’t know two important things: how many people get infected [infection attack rate], and how many get sick [clinical attack rate]”. “That is, we suspect there are a large number of people who aren’t identified as having Covid-19 because they have a mild cold. We can make guesses, but it will take time to get this information.” McMillan said a vaccine was likely 18 months away and would be useful only after the virus had gone pandemic. “It will eventually become just another cold/flu type virus we have to deal with and that mostly kills old and very young people.” He said media reports sensationalising the impacts of the virus would become problematic if a pandemic occurred, which now appeared likely as the disease spread in several countries.   Related: Airlines, carmakers and beer companies warn of tough times as coronavirus spreads    “We don’t wish to induce panic food or petrol stockpiling etc when for 95% of the population, this will be a mild cold. “Travel bans will no longer be useful or make sense and so health authorities need to prepare for the next phase. This includes preparing our hospitals for a large influx of patients, stockpiling any antivirals [some appear to work to slow the virus], and advising the public that when the time comes they will need to think about things like staying at home if ill, social distancing, and avoiding large gatherings.” Virologist Ian Mackay, associate professor at the University of Queensland, said it was unrealistic to expec­t that the virus could be containe­d to certain regions, and all countries should prepare for managing an influx of cases. “If the virus can’t be put back in its box worldwide, then it has the tools to become an endemic human coronavirus [we already live with four of those – HCoV-229E, -OC43, -NL63, and -HKU1]. Not today. Not tomorrow. Sometime in the future.” “So it’s really important that we find, test and isolate the ill to slow the spread and give hospitals plenty of time to prepare and manage cases without being overwhelmed. Many countries probably can’t trace, test and isolate as well as China, Singapore, Hong Kong have.”"
184,health,Philippines isolates hundreds of health workers as coronavirus cases rise in south-east Asia,"More than 670 Filipino health workers have been quarantined over fears they were exposed to coronavirus, while others have resorted to using bin bags for protection as case numbers rise across much of south-east Asia. More than 50 million people in the Philippines remain under lockdown, while the country’s medical facilities struggle with a lack of testing kits and shortages of protective equipment. Two major hospitals in the capital – the Medical City and the University of Santo Tomas Hospital – have quarantined at total of 674 health workers over fears they have been exposed to the virus, placing additional strain on wards. Across the country, two doctors are confirmed to have died. “It is painful for us to hear about their deaths. This is the reality we face. We are risking our lives as we fulfil our duties,” Maria Theresa Depano, health staff at a hospital outside Metro Manila, said.   Related: Coronavirus: how Asian countries acted while the west dithered    Across the region, countries have registered a wave of recent cases, including in Indonesia, where president Joko Widodo acknowledged last week that there was a need to immediately ramp up testing. Fearing an influx of patients, the country has turned the athlete’s village built for the 2018 Asian Games into an emergency hospital with a capacity to hold more than 4,000 people. Indonesia, which has been criticised for being slow to respond to the outbreak, has so far recorded 48 deaths and 514 infections. As in the Philippines, the death toll has prompted speculation that the number of cases is higher than official records suggest. Earlier this month, the country of 264 million people had carried out only a few hundred tests. In the Philippines, 396 cases have been registered, including 33 deaths, but thousands more patients are suspected to have the virus. Depano shared photos of health workers using bin bags to protect themselves at the Saint Jude hospital in Laguna. “We are calling the attention of DOH (department of health) or other agencies that may provide us personal protective equipment. We’ve run out of supplies and we don’t know where we can buy,” she said in her post.     Philippine doctors turn to garbage bags to protect themselves as colleagues die from coronavirus Photograph: Maria Theresa Depano    As hospitals in Manila appealed for donations, health officials said the lack of equipment was due to global supply shortages, rather than a lack of funding. The country was receiving money from international donors, they said. In the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus were rolled out from Monday morning, after the city’s governor Anies Baswedan declared a state of emergency for the next two weeks. All entertainment venues have been shut, and businesses urged to close their offices where possible. Anies said on Friday that he would also limit the number of passengers boarding public transport, and reduce the operational hours. Photos shared on social media, showing cramped train carriages packed with commuters, suggest such limits aren’t yet working. Widodo has so far resisted calls for a lockdown in virus-hit areas of the country, despite the tough restrictions introduced elsewhere in the region. Malaysia, which confirmed 1,306 cases as of Sunday, introduced a two-week lockdown last week after a sudden spike in cases. The majority of these new infections are linked to a mass rally at a mosque in Kuala Lumpur, which was attended by 16,000 people earlier this month. Ten deaths have been recorded. The number of confirmed infections has also risen sharply in Thailand, which reported 122 new coronavirus cases on Monday, taking the total to 721. In the capital, Bangkok, almost all businesses have been ordered to shut, prompting tens of thousands of workers to board buses to leave the city this weekend.   Related: Papua New Guinea declares state of emergency after first coronavirus case    It is feared that the vast numbers of people on the move could spread the disease to provinces elsewhere in Thailand, or to countries including Cambodia or Myanmar, where many migrant workers are returning. On Myanmar’s borders, people queued to be scanned by health teams as the entered the country. Officials maintain that there are no cases of coronavirus in Myanmar, a claim that has prompted questions over testing and surveillance measures. In Cambodia, which until recently had recorded few cases, 31 new infections were reported on Sunday, 29 of them among French tourists, bringing the country’s total to 84. Cases imported by travellers from abroad are a growing concern in Vietnam, which initially appeared to have contained the virus, before infections linked to international flights emerged in the country. On Sunday, 19 new coronavirus cases were confirmed, bringing the Vietnam’s tally to 113. Last week, anticipating the return of Vietnamese people from virus-hit countries, officials announced they had expanded the quarantined facilities so there is enough space for as many as 60,000 people. The country has also said it will temporarily suspend entry to almost all foreigners who have already obtained travel visa. Singapore, which recorded its first two coronavirus-related deaths on Saturday, also stepped up entry restrictions, stating that it would close its borders to short-term visitors and some foreign labourers. The measures follow warnings from the World Health Organisation, which called for countries in south-east Asia to introduce “more aggressive and whole of society efforts” to stop the spread of the coronavirus."

 Summary 
  
  We will close the blog for this evening. Thank you for your company and contributions.  
  A summary follows of Australia’s Covid-19 situation on the evening of Good Friday 2020.  
  This long weekend, stay home, stay well, save lives. 
  Australia’s new infection rate continues to slow 
  The commonwealth deputy chief health officer, Paul Kelly, says that “the curve is definitely decreasing”, the result of the border closures of a little over a fortnight ago and the social distancing measures enacted. 
   
   I would really urge caution there. Most of the cases we’ve seen so far have and still remain related to overseas travel and so our local epidemic is very early. There’s only a couple of thousand of those 6,000 cases are actual local transmission. 
   
  A total of 6,203 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in Australia, and there have been 54 deaths. New South Wales remains the state hardest hit, and Sydney in particular. 
  NSW minister resigns after fine for breaching public health order 
  Don Harwin, the NSW arts minister, was fined $1,000 for breaching the state’s coronavirus public health order. It emerged on Thursday that Harwin had been living at his million-dollar Central Coast holiday home, which is more than an hour’s drive from his east Sydney primary residence. The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, accepted his resignation. 
  Doubt cast over NRL’s return 
  A day after the NRL revealed it intended to restart the competition on 28 May, the league’s plans showed signs of unravelling. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said he had not been consulted on the league’s plan to resume play in seven weeks’ time, while the commonwealth deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, warned the league would need permission from authorities and expressed his concern over the risks of returning to action too soon. 
  Australians warned not to travel over Easter 
  State governments are taking a hard line against people looking to travel over the Easter holidays, with police patrolling routes to popular getaways, and employing helicopters and number plate technology to catch those breaching social distancing laws by travelling.

  Authorities in Queensland have stepped up border measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the sunshine state. The state’s chief medical officer posted a list of “Covid-19 hot spots” in NSW. Anyone who returns to the state from those locations will be forced to quarantine for 14 days. It marks the first time Australians have been required to quarantine for travelling from a specific part of the country. 
  Chef Pete Evans’ recipe to treat Covid condemned 
  Peak medical groups have criticised the Australian celebrity chef Pete Evans for suggesting that a $15,000 “subtle energy platform” could be used to treat coronavirus, saying such claims are baseless, ill-informed and dangerous. 
  Evans, a television host and paleo diet enthusiast who has previously promoted anti-vaccination ideas, was selling the BioCharger NG Subtle Energy Platform – dismissed by the Australian Medical Association as a “fancy light machine” – for $14,990 on his website. 
  Evans’ ad said the machine was a “subtle energy revitalisation platform”. 
  Covid-19 has so far infected more than 1.6 million people globally and killed 95,000. It has ground economies to a halt all over the world and has the potential to force hundreds of millions into poverty. 
  There is no evidence that it can be treated or cured by coloured lights. 
  Hard-pressed GPs face rent reduction requests from pathology giants 
  GP practices are under pressure to accept a 50% reduction in rental payments from major pathology corporations. It follows news that doctor-owned general practices are on the brink of financial collapse due to revenue losses from Covid-19.

 NSW premier accepts minister's resignation over Covid-19 breach 
  
  The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has accepted the resignation of her arts minister, Don Harwin, after he was fined $1,000 for staying at his Central Coast holiday home, breaching a Covid-19 public health order. 
  While Harwin maintained he had sought, and followed, official advice on whether he was allowed to relocate to his holiday home, he accepted the controversy surrounding his move – as the government was urging people to stay home over Easter – was a “distraction”. 
  Berejiklian accepted Harwin’s resignation, issuing a statement: 
   
   During this health crisis my government has asked the community to make greater sacrifices than all of us have ever had to make before. 
   These sacrifices are saving lives, and I am proud of the people of NSW for continuing to uphold the law in the interest of public health. 
   Late last night I was advised minister Don Harwin had been fined $1,000 for breaching a public health order. 
   The police, who have been tasked by my government with enforcing these health orders, came to the conclusion that minister Harwin breached the order. 
   Whilst minister Harwin has served the people of NSW well, and he continues to assure me that he did not break the rules, the orders in place apply equally to everybody. 
   Accordingly, minister Harwin has appropriately resigned from cabinet.

  As New York deals with a mounting coronavirus death toll and dwindling morgue space, the city has shortened the length of time it will hold unclaimed remains before they are buried in its public cemetery on Hart Island. 
  Aerial video captured workers digging graves on the island, a one-mile, limited-access strip near the Bronx. 
  Normally, about 25 bodies a week are interred on the island, mostly for people whose families can’t afford a funeral, or who go unclaimed by relatives. 
  Operations have now increased from one day a week to five days a week, with around 24 burials each day.

 NSW arts minister Don Harwin resigns over Covid-19 social distancing breach 
  
  NSW arts minister Don Harwin has resigned from the government after he was fined $1,000 by police for staying at his Central Coast holiday home, breaching a Covid-19 public health order. 
  As governments around Australia were urging their citizens to stay home over Easter, Harwin was spotted earlier in the week at his Pearl Beach house, more than an hour’s drive from his east Sydney primary residence. 
  Harwin maintained he sought formal advice that his living arrangements complied with the direction for people to stay at home, and that he acted in accordance with those orders. 
  But he says the controversy over his getaway was a “distraction” for the government at a critical time. 
  He has offered his resignation to the premier. 
  His statement in full: 
   
   Today I have offered my resignation to the premier as a minister in her government. 
   There is nothing more important than the work of the government in fighting the coronavirus crisis. 
   I will not allow my circumstances to be a distraction from that work and I very much regret that my residential arrangements have become an issue during this time.  
   At all times I have sought to act in accordance with public health orders and I sought advice that my living arrangements complied with those orders.  
   I remain confident that I have acted in accordance with those orders.  
   I know however that perception is just as important during these times.  
   The premier and her team are doing an outstanding job during the biggest crisis our state and nation have faced during our lifetimes.  
   It is absolutely vital they should be able to focus entirely on the health and economic issues facing our community.

  And while the focus has been on Sydney, the NSW government is seeking to roll out rapid testing for Covid-19 in regional areas to reduce waiting times. So far, 70% of tests in NSW have been in Sydney, which has identified clusters in the capital. But if you don’t test, you don’t find … 
  Again, our beloved friends at AAP: 
  Regional NSW towns will soon have access to rapid coronavirus testing, meaning samples won’t have to be sent to Sydney for analysis. 
  Broken Hill health workers will over Easter repurpose a machine used to rapidly test flu samples so it can detect the novel coronavirus.It should be operational by Monday and more regional areas will follow as specific hardware is imported.“That is really important, particularly for the more distant sites,” the NSW chief health officer, Kerry Chant, said on Friday.“Having that point-of-care testing, or testing that comes back in about an hour, is very useful because it gives us more rapid identification of cases.”St Vincent’s hospital is already using its repurposed GeneXpert machine in its emergency department and will also begin trialling another molecular test in the coming days.Of the 137,000 people tested for coronavirus in NSW since January, 70% have been in Sydney or on the Central Coast.Just 322 people in far western NSW have been tested while northern NSW and the Murrumbidgee are the two regions were there have been fewer than one test per 1,000 residents.Those three regions account for 100 positive cases.Chant defended the current turnaround time for testing – which can see results for Sydney-based cases returned within 24 hours.“The issue for rural and remote areas is the time it takes for specimens to come down to Sydney,” she said.“As we get more [novel coronavirus] cartridges for our GeneXperts, we will be looking at deploying this test across various sites.“We’ll have a mind to supporting rural and regional communities so we can give them access to the testing that is much more prompt in the metropolitan area.”

  NSW is the state with the most Covid-19 infections in the country. 
  (It should be noted that, by international standards, Australia and NZ have very low numbers of cases, low rates of community transmission, and low death rates. See here from Eleanor Ainge Roy in Dunedin and some other reporter: 
   
    Related: Have Australia and New Zealand stopped Covid-19 in its tracks?  
   
  But there is an interesting breakdown of cases in NSW, provided by NSW Health. 
   In the 24 hours to 8pm Thursday, an additional 49 cases of Covid-19 were diagnosed in NSW. 
  The total number of cases is 2,822 
  Deaths: 22 
  Cases tested and excluded: 134,619 
  Total people tested: 137,441 
  A total of 543 of NSW’s cases - nearly one-fifth - have originated from a cruise ship (in particular the Ruby Princess, which was controversially allowed to dock at Circular Quay in March). 
  Of NSW’s 2,822 cases; 
  Overseas acquired: 1,677 
  Locally acquired (contact of confirmed case and/or known cluster): 682 
  Locally acquired (contact not identified): 427 
  Under investigation: 36  
  The largest number of infections, by age group, is among people aged 20 to 29, with 611 confirmed cases.

  This is interesting, from AAP:A group of 18 Queensland drivers has been hit with fines for disobeying coronavirus regulations after police stopped a noisy burnout gathering. 
  Officers were called to an industrial area in Loganholme, south of Brisbane, where they cordoned off a street about 11pm on Thursday. 
  More than 10 vehicles were intercepted and 18 infringement notices of $1,334 issued for failing to comply with a Covid-19 direction, police said on Friday. 
  It seems the burn-outs were fine – if needless, noisy and self-defeating (they’re your tyres after all) – you just can’t do burn-outs in a group. I’m reminded of that age-old philosophical question: if you do a massive burn-out, but none of your mates are around to watch, have you really burnt out at all?

  The Western Australia minister for health and deputy premier Roger Cook has reported seven new cases of Covid-19 in the state, as well as four new cases linked to the cruise ship Artania. The 11 new cases are in people aged between 25 and 78, and bring the state’s total to 506. 
  The total number of cases linked to cruise ships is 191, more than one-third of the total. 
  Six people have died in WA. 
  Also in Western Australia, several hundred passengers who had been on board the Vasco da Gama cruise ship are due to end their quarantine today. The West Australian passengers have been held on Rottnest Island, they will be ferried back to Perth this afternoon. 
  But hundreds of others from the east coast and other parts of Australia are coming out of quarantine, today and in coming days, without a way home because of mass cancellation of flights across the country. 
  Cook said the state government would continue to accommodate those passengers, while finding a way to get them home. 
   
   The state government is aware that there are limited flights available for people returning home following their 14-day isolation in Western Australia. The department of health is liaising with other agencies and airlines to determine viable solutions to get these people home as soon as practicable. 
   While flights are being arranged to transport people home, they will continue to be accommodated by the state. We want to reassure people who have been in isolation that we will be working to make the transition home as smooth as possible so they can return to their homes and families as quickly as they can. 
   We understand those in isolation and quarantine have enjoyed difficulty and stress and appreciate the sacrifice they and their family and friends are making to keep our communities safe. 
   
  The state’s deputy chief health officer Robin Lawrence said those who had completed their quarantine, but who were still waiting to fly home, would be allowed out of their hotels. 
  For the passengers from the Vasco da Gama, that would be in a few hours. 
   
   As of 4:30pm they will have some increased freedom to move around the local area and the city as long as they maintain social distancing, as required. 
   We are very grateful for their patience and consideration during the 14 days they have been undertaking quarantine. 
   For all other future passengers, we will be in contact to work out where they have come from and how they can get home and we thank them for their patience in keeping the state of Western Australia, themselves and their families safe this time.

  Queensland’s chief medical officer has posted a list of “Covid-19 hot spots” in NSW and ordered anyone returning to the state from those locations to quarantine for 14 days. 
  It has been one week since Queensland closed its border to New South Wales for the first time since the Spanish Flu outbreak of 1919. Police have been enforcing the “hard closure” at three checkpoints between the towns of Coolangatta and Tweed Heads on either side of the border. 
  The gates have also been shut on the state’s two other shared borders between the Northern Territory and South Australia. 
  Queensland residents are exempt from the ban, but from Saturday those returning home from a list of designated inter-state “Covid-19 hot spots” will be forced to undergo two weeks quarantine.

  Advocates for the unemployed have called on the government to extend the $550 per fortnight coronavirus supplements to disability support pensioners and carers.  
  The Guardian reported last month that people on these payments would now receive a lower base rate of income support than a jobseeker or a person receiving parenting payment who did not have a disability.  
  “[The Australian Unemployed Workers Union] has been flooded with calls and messages from our members who have been unfairly excluded from the $550 supplement, and thousands of people have signed our petition to #RaiseTheDSP,” a statement read.  
  “The minister has been granted extraordinary new powers that mean she can do this without going back to parliament. No legislation is required.”  
  A Greens motion to include these welfare recipients in the coronavirus supplement failed to win the support of the government or Labor this week.  
  However, the minister, Anne Ruston, can extend the supplement without legislation.  
  “I’m on DSP, not parenting payment but I’m the only person raising my children, why is it I’m not seen to have extra costs/needs,” said Emma, a respondent to an AUWU survey.

  Just to recap deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly’s comments on the NRL’s decision to restart.  
  Kelly said emphasised that we all have a responsibility to continue with social distancing measures.  
  He said that although the league’s players were not at high risk, others who are involved in the game would be.  
  Kelly specifically named two coaches, Wayne Bennett and Ricky Stuart, as being vulnerable to Covid-19.  
  “To be really frank about this, we all have a place in this and if we loosen the social distancing measures at the moment it can have an implication down the track,” he said. 
  He added that it “remains to be seen” whether May is the right time to restart the league, but that the NRL would “definitely need to get some permission to do that”.  
  The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, confirmed today that he hadn’t been consulted prior to the league’s announcement of a planned restart date.

  He says: 
   
   “It sounds like a reality show they might continue it on, not just the playing, but what happens for the rest of the week, the mind boggles. If they’re by themselves and they’re away from the rest of society, then that is a thing. 
   “But I just reiterate the young men and women who play the game won’t be the only ones there. They need to think carefully about their coaching staff and other supporters. And think about their social responsibility, even on the island.” 
   
  
 Updated at 5.35am BST 
 
 
  5.20am BST  
  
  Is the NRL risking the community by saying they will return to the game?  
  Kelly says:  
   
   “The other part I say about the NRL, they’re general very fit young men and women, so they – they themselves are not at high risk and if they were just part of the – I understand the proposal is to play -continue to play in empty stadium, so they could be their own microcosm. 
   “For them, it may not be a big problem. There’s other people around the teams, Wayne Bennett is in his 70s, he would be in a vulnerable group, Ricky Stuart with the mighty Raiders, he would potentially be in a vulnerable group, so thinking about the team, not just the players, but those – the support staff around them, is important. And, look, they’re making their plans for the road out I encourage them to do so in other sports. But whether May is the time will remain to be seen and definitely they’ll need to get some permission to do that.”

  Kelly is asked about the NRL’s plans to restart the game next month. He is asked whether the NRL would need permission from state government or whether they are, for want of a better word, “a law unto unto themselves in this regard”?  
  He says: 
   
   “I don’t think they’re a law unto themselves. Some of the players and coaches may think so, but they’re part of society and they have a part – as we have all done, to support not only safety for themselves but for all of us. To be really frank about this, we all have a place in this and if we loosen the social distancing measures at the moment it can have an implication down the track. 
   “I’ve said here before on average, what we know about this virus, if we don’t have these social distancing measures, one person can lead to 400 other cases within a month. And so, that is the sort of explosive epidemic we’ve seen in other countries. And we just cannot afford at this stage to be considering that happening.”

  5.13am BST  
  
  Kelly says that “the curve is definitely decreasing”.  
   
   “I would really urge caution there. Most of the cases we’ve seen so far have and still remain related to overseas travel and so our local epidemic is very early. There’s only a couple of thousand of those 6,000 cases are actual local transmission. 
   “So, we need to see what happens with those and to learn from other countries that have going through a much more difficult time with much larger epidemics to see what happens as they pass that peak and see what happens from there, about being guided, what to do to get back to some sort of normality, a new normality, I would suggest, at least in the shorter term.”

  Kelly said that it would be a great “achievement” if the virus began to die out in parts of Australia.  
  But he adds: “It does bring with it a challenge, of course, it would mean the most of us would not have been exposed yet. So we would remain susceptible to the virus if it was re-introduced.” 
  
 
 
  5.10am BST  
  
  The deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, has started speaking in Canberra. 
  He is asked if about the possibility that people can became immune to the virus.  
   
   “Yes, that would be a very important thing to know. At this stage, we’re only - I calculated this week - 14weeks into the virus. Only the first cases in Australia were in mid-to-late January. So it’s only very early. So at this stage, if we were able to look at people that might have been exposed at that time or indeed were diagnosed with the virus and see if they can immune now, it would be very short-term immunity still. 
   “It remains to be seen what happens in the longer term. There’s studies done in China, there will be studies here in Australia as well, looking at that immune element. But at this time we can’t tell.”

  Tasmanian police have told 15 people on their way to holiday spots to go home during Covid-19 patrols over the past 24 hours. 
  AAP reports that the force intercepted more than 35 people in cars - including some towing caravans and boats - and turned them back as needed. 
  Three people have been arrested or summoned to appear in court over Covid-19 related offences, the force confirmed on Friday. 
  “This Easter, if you are away from your primary residence and try to go to your shack and you don’t have a valid excuse, you will not only be turned around, but you could be charged and face a substantial fine,” Acting Assistant Commissioner Jo Stolp said. 
  Premier Peter Gutwein told residents on Thursday not to leave their homes unnecessarily, with fines of up to $16,800 or six months’ jail.  
  Helicopters are monitoring people’s movements, hovering over regional communities including Bicheno, Friendly Beaches, Coles Bay, Dunalley and Primrose Sands. 
  Officers are also patrolling on foot in Bridport, St Helens, Longford, Great Lake, Port Sorell, Somerset and Smithton among the areas. 
  Tasmania had recorded 111 cases of the virus as of Thursday night, with 48 of those people recovering.

  The NSW government has announced that healthcare workers would now benefit from free parking at public hospital carparks during the Covid-19 crisis.  
  “Our healthcare workers are on the frontline of our battle with Covid-19 and we need to do whatever we can to support them during this difficult time,” the premier, Gladys Berejiklian said. 
  “We hope this new measure makes life a little easier for our doctors, nurses and other hospital staff who are working hard to keep us all safe.” 
  The free parking begins from today.

  Some good news for the more than 100 Australian and New Zealand residents who were aboard the Antartica cruise that was anchored of the coast of Uruguay.  
  AAP reports that the group are expected to land in Melbourne over Easter after Aurora Expeditions, the operator of the Greg Mortimer ship, chartered a flight from Montevideo. 
  The news was confirmed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told AAP on Friday. 
  Of the more than 200 people on the vessel, 96 are Australian passengers and crew, along with roughly 16 New Zealand citizens. 
  Five Australians have already been taken off the Greg Mortimer and admitted to hospital in Montevideo, DFAT said.

  The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has issued a statement slamming celebrity chef Pete Evans, after the Channel Seven star and reality television host posted a video falsely suggesting a $15,000 light machine could be used treat Covid-19. 
  In a live video posted to his Facebook page, the My Kitchen Rules judge said the BioCharger NG Subtle Energy Platform “is a pretty amazing tool” and claims there are “a thousand different recipes” including “a couple on there for Wuhan coronavirus”. 
   Evans is selling the product on his own website for $14,990. It states the product is “a hybrid subtle energy revitalisation platform” with “four transmitted energies” which “stimulate and invigorate the entire body to optimise and improve potential health, wellness and athletic performance”. 
  The post has been condemned by RACGP president Harry Nespolon, who said Evans, who has in the past promoted anti-vaccination views, “needs to stop”. 
  Nespolon said he had suggested several months ago Evans should “leave vaccinations alone”.  
   “Well, he should also steer well clear of peddling devices which he claims use ‘subtle energy’ to counter Covid-19. He just needs to stop it right now. 
   “It is a reality that many people look up to Mr Evans in his roles as a popular chef and television host. I once again urge him to book an appointment with his local GP to learn about the damage he is doing on social media.”

  Kerry Chant says the 69-year-old man who died in Newcastle overnight likely contracted the virus “during a recent trip interstate”. The man had travelled to Queensland. 
   
   Obviously, we are watching locally acquired cases, and I think from the beginning I’ve explained that they raise the major concern for me, because they reflect areas where we might need to have that focused testing to establish there’s not broader transmission in the community.  
   So, earlier this week, I called upon the community to increase testing in some of those areas, where we had identified cases. We will continue to update and call on the community to come forward to have increased testing in areas where we identify local transmission.

  Asked about the $1,000 fine levelled against arts minister Don Harwin last night for breaching public health orders, he says:  
   
   Look, as I said yesterday in relation to Mr Harwin, it doesn’t matter who you are, there are very strict rules to try and keep us all safe. And the imposition of a fine, if that’s what the police consider appropriate, is a matter for them. I can’t comment beyond that. That’s not my purview.

  Hazzard is asked about the NRL’s announcement yesterday that they will restart the competition on 28 May.  
  He says he has only had one meeting with the game, which was about four weeks ago before it was shutdown. 
   
   If the NRL want to go ahead, happy to have the chat and make sure, with medical advice, as to whether or not it’s appropriate. 
   The only meeting I’ve had that I can tell you about is around about a month ago, with [chief executive] Todd Greenberg and [chairman] Peter V’landys to talk about the issue. But that was before they actually made a decision to shut the game down. So, I haven’t had any discussions with them at this stage.

  Hazzard has recovered from his coughing fit and is back taking questions.  
  He’s asked about new $5,000 on-the-spot fines in NSW for people who cough or spit on health workers.  
   
   If I had my choice, I would be locking them up pretty quick-smart. But the police will hand them, in the first instance, a $5,000 fine. There is another option. And that is that if the police choose to they can actually enforce a court attendance notice and a charge, which would allow an $11,000 fine and $6,000. But this is an on-the-spot $5,000 fine. I can’t remember any fine like this in the past history, where a police officer could hand over a $5,000 fine on the spot. It’s quite unprecedented. 
   
  He’s asked about a McDonald’s worker who was allegedly spat on yesterday, and whether the fines should be extended. Says they will look at it.

   It’s been pleasing to see that we’ve continued to see an increase in testing numbers. And my message to the community is to please, our services are open over the Easter period and I would urge you to continue to access those services.  
   I’d also like to [send a message] to the community that our services are safe and available, so it’s very important that you don’t neglect any other underlying chronic diseases, or if you develop symptoms that need - that you need to access urgent care, please continue to do so.

  The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, appeared on one of the commercial breakfast TV networks and admitted to feeling “a degree of frustration” with Australians stranded overseas.  
  Thousands of Australians remain scattered overseas, and on Thursday the foreign affais minister outlined plans for charter flights for people trying to get home from various parts of the world. A special Qantas flight from Peru landed in Australia overnight. Birmingham said: 
   
   There are frustrations, no doubt about that. We were one of the early countries in the world to urge Australians reconsider their need to travel, and to urge them to come home and to ultimately to urge them to or to tell them that travel was not to be undertaken and to enforce quite strict arrangements in place.  
   There is a degree of frustration there. But our diplomats have been working day and night around the world to come up with solutions to help Australians be able to safely get home. That is why we have stepped in to make sure there are some regular flights available over the next few weeks. We can’t guarantee that it will go on beyond that.  
   But you can get home from places if you can connect in to London or Hong Kong or Singapore or San Francisco because we put in place those regular flights. We are also looking at exceptional circumstances where we do need to work to get aviation capacity into places such as Peru, where there is a flight that has come in overnight. It is the second one that has come out of there in a space of about a week.  
   We have circumstances in Uruguay that we are working through, in South African and the Philippines. These are incredibly complex arrangements given the travel restrictions that other countries have imposed and the collapse in international aviation. It is not unreasonable that Australians who are overseas, some of whom will have ignored the travel warnings, will have to make a contribution to their return.

  Police in Victoria have issued 98 fines for breaches of public health orders in the past 24 hours. The fines include nine children who were fined “for gathering in a private residence” and a man who received four warnings before he was fined. 
  Unlike in NSW, police in Victoria have refused to release data about the locations of the fines. We also don’t know any demographic indicators about the people who have been fined. So, for example, their housing status or ethnicity.  
  Victoria police say they conducted 754 spot checks at homes, businesses and non-essential services in the past 24 hours. Since 21 March they have conducted a total of 18,386 spot checks.

  Once upon a time, when I was a journalist at a regional newspaper, my colleagues and I used to joke about the carbon-copy stories we’d be forced to write on an annual basis.  
  People working on Christmas Day, police warnings about double demerits and, of course, lines at the fish co-op on Good Friday. Well, Covid-19 has at least added a bit of spice to the latter yarn. 
  AAP reports that the Sydney Fish Market will still open its doors for what is usually one its busiest days but this year strict social distancing measures and temperature checks will be in place.  
  More than 40,000 people usually flock to the market on Good Friday to snap up seafood for the Easter weekend but this year only 400 people will be allowed on the site at one time. 
  People will have their temperature checked on arrival, be given hand sanitiser and be asked to follow social distancing rules to limit the spread of Covid-19. 
  “Obviously it’s going to be a very different Easter down at the fish market this weekend,” a spokeswoman, Stephanie Margrain, told AAP. 
  “There’ll be no oysters on the boardwalk ... Come down, shop quickly and get home.” 
  The market has been working with NSW police and NSW Health to develop a plan that ensures people who have made a tradition out of going to the fish market on Good Friday can continue to do so safely. 
  “We’re not trying to encourage lots of people to come down like we normally would, but we’re conscious for many it is a tradition,” she said.

  A 31-year-old man Palm Beach will face drug charges after Queensland police allegedly found 93kg of cannabis during a stop at a state border checkpoint on Wednesday. 
  In a statement this morning Queensland police said officers at the checkpoint intercepted a Ford Ranger utility with a trailer trying to enter Queensland about 5.30pm on Wednesday. 
  It will be alleged that during a search of the vehicle police found 93kg of cannabis and $4,300 in cash. Police say the drugs have a street value of about $450,000. 
  A 31-year-old Palm Beach man was arrested and charged with the possession of dangerous drugs and the possession of property suspected of be used in connection with a drug offence. 
  He has been bailed to appear at the Coolangatta magistrates court on 6 July. The man was also issued a $1,334 infringement notice for breaching the state’s public health orders. 
  Detective Inspector Chris Ahearn from the Gold Coast criminal investigation branch said “any person attempting to enter our state, even if they are a Queensland resident, should expect a heightened level of scrutiny”. 
  “In addition to the current biosecurity risks, police will remain vigilant to disrupt any criminal activity,” Ahearn said.

  The federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, has released his own Easter message.  
  Like the prime minister he’s urged people to stay home during the “once-in-a-generation health crisis” caused by Covid-19. 
   
   Easter is traditionally a time when Australians gather together. For Christians, they go to church services. For other Australians, they spend time together with family, with friends, and with other members of their local community. 
   But this Easter is different. We need people to stay home. To stay home in the interest of their own health. But also, the health of others. 
   The COVID-19 crisis is a once in a generation health crisis. And we need to take it seriously. Whilst overwhelmingly we want Australians to stay home, some people will be working. 
   Our health workers, our police and emergency services, our transport workers. Some who work in industries like our supermarkets who will continue to work over the Easter break. 
   We need to give them our thanks. 
   They are keeping us safe and doing an extraordinary job in difficult times. This age of social distancing and self-isolation means that we are all keeping 1.5 metres apart. But in so many ways, we as Australians have never been as together as we are now. 
    So, I wish all Australians a peaceful Easter at home. The good news for kids is that the Easter bunny is allowed to visit your home this Sunday. 
   I wish you and your family all the best this Easter.

  The shadow arts minister, Walt Secord, has issued a statement calling for Gladys Berejiklian to sack Harwin: 
   
   The premier has no choice but to sack the arts minister. Yesterday, she defended him. An apology is not enough. 
   
   
   Mr Harwin is a personal friend of the premier and a factional ally, but he is not above the law. He has been travelling back and forth to Sydney from Pearl Beach. Pearl Beach is an elderly community. These health orders are there to protect the most vulnerable.

  Let’s take a look at what’s in the other papers today.  
  The Sydney Morning Herald leads on Covid-19 clusters inside New South Wales hospitals after the state’s health department revealed on Thursday that 12 new cases have been discovered at Gosford hospital. Two were hospital patients, six staff and four family members or friends.  
  The paper is also reporting the concerns of retail workers, who say they are “scared and desperate” about catching Covid-19 and are begging for businesses to stop in-store trading. 
  The  Age in Melbourne lead on the education minister Dan Tehan’s threat to cut funding to independent schools if they close during the pandemic.  
  The Australian reports that the University of Melbourne will take a $500m revenue hit this year because of Covid-19, as the vice-chancellor, Duncan Maskell, and his executive team take a 20% pay cut. The Oz also says more than 600,000 Australians have registered their interest in drawing down as much as $20,000 from their superannuation funds. 
  In Sydney the News Limited tabloid Daily Telegraph leads on Don Harwin, in Melbourne the Herald Sun goes coronavirus-free on the front page, instead reporting on the Good Friday cancer fundraising appeal, and the Hobart Mercury splashes on the Tasmanian premier Peter Gutwein’s message that “the gloves are off” in police enforcement of public health orders over the Easter long weekend.

  As the rate of infection in Australia continues to fall, authorities are nervous about the potential for the Easter long weekend – when many people usually travel – could seet off a new wave of Covid-19 cases. 
  They’ve been urging people to stay at home over the break, and state premiers have warned police will be out in large numbers enforcing lockdown rules. 
  Drawing on his faith, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, used his Easter message to drive home the importance of social distancing: 
   
   I hope it is a time as you come together in your homes, together with your immediate family, that it will be a strong reminder about what’s most important. 
   For Christians, not being able to gather does not diminish the hope that we have through this important Easter period. 
   This year, we will live out our faith by doing the right thing. That means staying at home, making sure we’re checking on our neighbours and supporting our communities and families, our friends.

 NSW arts minister fined $1,000 for breaching lockdown laws. 
  
  First up, a little bit more on that Don Harwin news.  
  Late last night the New South Wales police issued a statement saying they had issued a fine after being “alerted” that a 55-year-old man had “relocated to a holiday home at Pearl Beach, in contravention of current Ministerial Direction under the Public Health Act”. 
  “As part of inquiries, investigators from Central Metropolitan Region attended the Elizabeth Bay home unit and spoke with the man,” NSW police said. “Following further inquiries, the man was issued a $1000 PIN via email just before 9pm.” 
  The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has resisted calls to sack Harwin, saying he didn’t break the rules because he moved to his Central Coast home on 13 March, before the state lockdown came into effect. But multiple reports on Thursday indicated Harwin had travelled back to Sydney for appointments while staying at the Central Coast property. 
  “No one individual or corporation is above these laws – anyone suspected of breaching the orders will be investigated and if a breach is detected, they will be dealt with in accordance with the Act,” said the police commissioner, Mick Fuller.  
  “On behalf of the community, I strongly urge those with information about breaches to contact police.”

  Good morning. It’s Friday, 10 April. Welcome to today’s coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic in Australia. I’m Michael McGowan. I’ll be bringing you all of today’s Good Friday news, but first here’s how we left things last night: 
   
   Australia reported its lowest number of new cases in three weeks on Thursday, with 96 people diagnosed since the last update, nationally. It was the first time in three weeks Australia’s new cases have dropped below 100. One 76-year-old South Australian man died, bringing the country’s death toll to 51. 
   The New South Wales minister for arts, Don Harwin, has been fined $1,000 for breaching the state’s strict public health orders. Harwin got himself in strife after it emerged he had left Sydney for his property on the Central Coast, despite the Berejiklian government urging the public to delay non-essential travel. 
   The federal education minister, Dan Tehan, ordered independent schools to reopen and provide in-person education to children whose parents want it in term two. Tehan said he would make independent schools’ funding contingent on complying with the order. 
   The Block star Scott Cam has agreed to forgo his $345,000 salary as Australia’s “national careers ambassador”. The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, said Cam had agreed to give up his salary given his “role has fundamentally changed” due to Covid-19.

"
186,health,Can e-Mental health bridge the treatment gap?,"Australians install a lot of apps: about 100 per person on average. We’re offered digital solutions for just about anything, and mental health management is no exception. There are more than 10,000 apps out there claiming to address everything from diagnosis to self-management - and that’s not including the various online forums, chatbots, blogs and virtual reality systems. With more of us seeking treatment than ever, could e-mental health be an effective, quick, cheap and convenient way to address the growing demand for services? Well, it depends. We want more mental healthcare, and we want it now Thanks to a cultural shift in the past decade, we’re more ready than ever to seek help, says Dr Harry Nespolon, president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP). “Back in the old days, people used to come in and have a bit of a dance, so to speak, before they would start to talk about their mental health issues,” Nespolon says. “Nowadays, people come in and sit down and say, ‘I’m depressed’.” In the 2019 RACGP Health of the Nation report, 65% of surveyed GPs said mental health was the most common issue they managed.     GP and member of the RACGP Expert Committee - Quality Care, A/Prof Paresh Dawda speaks about the recent findings that once again psychological issues are the main reason Australians are seeing their #GP. #WorldMentalHealthDay #HOTN2019 pic.twitter.com/yLZ1DKgoNT— RACGP (@RACGP) October 10, 2019    GPs are the right port of call, but they’re stretched Nespolon says patients are going to the right place. “Patients don’t walk in as people with only mental health issues,” he says. Mental health issues are often accompanied by other health conditions, and GPs are well placed to provide total care, within an existing, trusted relationship. GPs are also the most easily accessed part of the health system. But while Medicare covers a certain number of psychologist sessions under mental healthcare plans, there is usually still a gap that leaves patients out of pocket. “A lot of mental healthcare can be adequately managed in general practice,” Nespolon says. “It prevents visits to secondary and tertiary care. It means that patients can come and have their problems discussed and managed early. There’s an enormous saving to the community.” But he says the Medicare system doesn’t adequately support GPs in treating mental health, Nespolon says. Mental health consultations are covered by an item number that supports just a 20-minute session. Nespolon says that’s not long enough, because mental health consultations often take 40-60 minutes. “Most doctors do take the time, although they’re technically not being paid for it,” he says. Ninety per cent of Australians visit their doctor at least once a year, so the cost to GPs starts to add up. “Patients get good service at the moment,” he says. “Unless there’s improved investment in general practice that may not be going on forever.” The good, the bad, and how to tell the difference Dr Nespolon sees e-mental health as a useful adjunct to treatment, particularly for mild and moderate depression and anxiety, and if getting to a service is difficult because of time, distance or cost. It is also a good option if other pressures (such as the mental health problem itself) make leaving the house an ordeal. “The studies show that [apps] are beneficial,” Nespolon says. “It depends where the patient is at. If the patient has a more complex illness or is in a crisis, then an app isn’t where they should be. If they’re at risk of developing a mental illness or if they are at the milder to moderate end then probably trying an app is OK.            “It can be up to the patient to work out what they can access, because going to see a person - such as a psychologist - regularly can be quite difficult.” But not all apps are created equal, and few have been properly evaluated. Some are simply ineffective, leaving a user feeling hopeless about treatment. Others are downright harmful, giving bad advice and wrong information. And then there’s the data - who’s collecting it, and why? “The apps you find from recognised institutions would probably be a good starting point,” Nespolon says. “That’s probably the most important thing.” Resources such as the Australian Government’s Head to Health page and the ANU’s Beacon portal can help sort through the daunting number of options. And the Black Dog Institute has analysed a variety of e-mental health resources.            The American Psychiatric Association’s advice is to ask a lot of questions, including who’s behind the app, what evidence do they have to support their claims, and how easy is it to use. It even provides a checklist and scorecard to help you make a decision. “The other thing is, if you don’t think you’re getting anything out of it, don’t just struggle on with it, hoping that it might work out,” Nespolon says. “Give it a go, but if it’s not working, it’s not working. Move on and seek different help.” The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) is Australia’s largest professional general practice organisation - our mission is to improve the health and wellbeing of all people in Australia by supporting GPs, general practice registrars and medical students."
187,health,Impeachment was a health-check for American democracy. It is not well,"The acquittal of Donald Trump reminds us once again of the fragility of American democracy. The failure of impeachment along blatantly partisan lines means that the crucial barriers protecting us from authoritarianism cannot be relied on. The fate of the country’s institutions are left to the mercies of a man singularly unfit to safeguard them. The slow creep of authoritarian rule need not be dramatic. It can even, as impeachment seemed at times, be rather boring. Democracy can die by inches, with precedents being established and barriers swept away so gradually that we don’t see what is happening until it is too late. Historians may look back on the past few years as just such a time, with today’s acquittal bringing to maturity a process from which American democracy may take a long time to recover. It might not even be Donald Trump who consummates the transition. The changes he has wrought over Republican politics will encourage his successors to follow in his footsteps. Horrifyingly, these successors may even be intelligent and competent, unlike their forefather. The right has entered a permanent war footing in which everything – especially truth and principle – is subordinated to the quest for total victory. Perhaps this army will stand down once Trump leaves the scene, or there will be no new general to take up its banner. It seems unlikely. But the immediate danger is posed by Trump himself and his enablers. The US Senate majority’s collective shrug in the face of Trump’s crimes rips away the final theoretical restraint on his actions. Alan Dershowitz, one of Trump’s lawyers, went so far as to claim that the president can legally do anything in pursuit of his own re-election if he believes that doing so is in the public interest, almost as if Trump really could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue provided that person was on their way to vote for a Democrat. Dershowitz later attempted to clarify his remark by saying that it wouldn’t apply if the president’s act was specifically prohibited by law. This was a strange clarification given that Trump did in fact violate the law when he withheld aid to Ukraine, and Trump anyway has previously claimed that the constitution gives the president the power to do “whatever I want”. Before his acquittal, these bizarre theories of executive power have been just that – theories. Now they carry the force of precedent.    A theory of executive supremacy, a supine legislature, and a credulous, adoring segment of the population are the ingredients that authoritarianism is made of    The abjectness of the Republican party compounds the danger. If they stuck by the president through the Ukraine affair they will stick by him through anything. They have acted like the totalitarian functionaries who Hannah Arendt said view the difference between truth and falsehood as something which “depends entirely on the power of the man who can fabricate it”. And while they may have the power to fabricate “truth” for those living in the rightwing media bubble, to everyone else – including the 71% of the public who wanted the Senate to call witnesses – their disconnect from reality has been cringeworthy. A theory of executive supremacy, a supine legislature and a credulous, adoring segment of the population – which does not need to be a majority – are the ingredients that authoritarianism is made of. Because he certainly isn’t restrained by principle, the fate of American democracy now rests on the question of whether Trump knows the right way to mix the ingredients together. By far the greatest risk will come in November. We know by now that the standard rightwing playbook calls for painting the Democratic nominee as a dangerous radical hellbent on destroying America, and claiming that millions of “illegals” voted for them, rendering the election result void. Imagine this rhetoric unfolding as Trump endures a narrow electoral loss and refuses to concede. Can we have any faith that a Senate and a US supreme court in the hands of his servants will show him the door? Arendt also understood that those who use their power to construct a world of falsehoods for their supporters eventually have to destroy the power of those who would challenge it with the truth. This is why lies are so dangerous in a democracy, and it is why Trump and his allies systematically attack all independent sources of factual authority in society: the media, the civil service, the law. Elections, which force would-be tyrants to face up to the authority of the greater part of the public which does not live in their dreamworld, are perhaps the greatest threat of all. That is why Trump cannot help but try to subvert them, and it is why he will inevitably do so again. None of this means that impeachment was a mistake. Like acquittal, a failure to impeach at all would have sent the same signal: that there are no limits on Trump’s actions. Impeachment at least kept the torch of the truth and the law alive. But now we must be very careful. They are about to – they must – come to try to extinguish that torch. Only an electoral repudiation so vast that it cannot be questioned can prevent them, and it must be won at a time when their power has never been less restrained by law or principle. The fate of democracy in America depends on it.  Andy Gawthorpe is a historian of the United States at Leiden University "
188,health,Bernie Sanders surges in Democratic field after shrugging off health scare,"Shortly after Bernie Sanders announced early this month that his campaign raised a showstopping $34.5m – the highest sum of any 2020 Democrat during any single quarter so far in this primary – #PresidentSanders was trending on Twitter. It was an extraordinary reversal of fortunes for a presidential candidate who, three months earlier, was in a Las Vegas hospital recovering from a heart attack. At the time, Sanders was under immense political pressure, eclipsed by fellow progressive Elizabeth Warren and counted out by many in the party and by the president. The episode might have derailed Sanders’ second quest for the White House had it not been for his army of loyal supporters, whose abiding faith turned the Vermont senator into a formidable contender for the Democratic nomination. With less than four weeks until voting begins and the next debate looming on Tuesday, Sanders is surging in Iowa and New Hampshire as his campaign touts new signs of growth in his support, particularly among young people of color. Even Larry David, the comedian who impersonates Sanders with striking likeness on Saturday Night Live, has been surprised by his doppelganger’s resilience. “I thought when he had the heart attack that was going to be it – I wouldn’t have to fly in from Los Angeles,” David told late-night host Stephen Colbert. “But, you know, he’s indestructible. Nothing stops this man.” Perhaps, but Sanders would not be where he is in the final weeks before the Iowa caucuses without the unwavering support of a devoted community that he has cultivated since running for president in 2016. “Not me. Us” – Sanders’ campaign slogan – perfectly captures how the 78-year-old senator came to sit atop the latest Des Moines Register and CNN poll of Iowa caucusgoers in a primary contest that has so far been shaped by candidates who are younger, more diverse and newer to national politics.     ‘Nothing stops this man.’ Bernie Sanders meets his TV doppelganger, Larry David. Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images    In the days and weeks after Sanders’ hospitalization, an outpouring of concern and well wishes turned into a record wave of campaign donations that culminated in a “Bernie is back” rally in Queens featuring Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York congresswoman who traces her political rise to Sanders’ 2016 campaign. There, she formally endorsed him in front of more than 20,000 ardent supporters. “The heart attack was in some ways the best thing that happened to his campaign,” said Ana Maria Archila, the co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy, a coalition of progressive groups that endorsed Sanders in December. She said it turned out to be a clarifying moment for his supporters, with Ocasio-Cortez’s endorsement serving as a literal rallying cry. “Bernie has built a movement that makes people believe a different kind of politics is possible,” she said. “So when he came back, everyone wanted him to feel the love.” In surveys, Sanders supporters are significantly more loyal to him than those backing any other 2020 Democrat. They are more likely to say they will definitely vote for him and that they are “enthusiastic” about his candidacy. Their unshakeable support means that unlike many of his rivals Sanders may have the resources to stay in the race for months after the early-voting contests. Many Democrats fear he won’t exit the race even if he doesn’t have the delegates to win the nomination, dragging out the primary contest, weakening the eventual nominee and possibly even setting up a dramatic showdown at the party’s convention in Milwaukee. Sanders has said he would support the nominee. Sanders’ movement – coupled with a massive fundraising operation – sustained him through a potentially debilitating period of his campaign and lifted him higher still.  More than any other Democratic campaign, his supporters are highly organized online. They share stories, polling and memes across hundreds of pro-Sanders Facebook groups. And this cycle, his campaign launched its own mobile app, Bern, and its own email newsletter, Bern Notice, that keeps his supporters engaged and up to date with news from the trail. “These tools are not as effective for persuasion,” said Michael Slaby, the Obama campaign’s chief technology officer in 2008 and chief integration and innovation officer in 2012. “If you’re an undecided voter you’re probably not tuning in to watch Sanders’ Twitch channel. But in terms of his ability to withstand challenges, it is really valuable to have that durable hard support.” ••• Now an emboldened Sanders is sharpening his case for the presidency, tapping his deep financial resources to launch a large-scale advertising campaign in Iowa. He’s also become increasingly critical of his closest rival, Joe Biden, the putative Democratic frontrunner who has proved resilient at the top of the splintered field despite sustained attacks and self-inflicted gaffes. In interviews and on the trail, Sanders has emphasized his longstanding aversion to war in response to the escalation of tensions with Iran. It’s part of a wider strategy to undermine the core rationale for Biden’s candidacy: that he’s the most electable. In particular, the senator has aggressively criticized Biden for his 2003 vote to authorize the invasion of Iraq and his past support for foreign trade deals. Biden has mostly brushed off Sanders’ broadsides, though that could change in the next debate on 14 January, the last before the caucuses. He has also quietly started to target Warren, a fellow liberal and a friend whom he had refused to engage publicly.     Bernie Sanders supporters voice their backing at a rally in Los Angeles last month. Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images    A script obtained by Politico instructed Sanders’ volunteers to tell voters wavering between the two liberals that Warren’s popularity was limited to the affluent and highly educated and that she was “bringing no new bases into the Democratic party” – a criticism meant to raise doubts about her electability. Her campaign responded in a fundraising letter on Sunday: “This type of attack isn’t about disagreeing on issues – it’s about dismissing the potency of our grassroots movement.” Sanders’ potential for victory, meanwhile, has stirred panic among establishment-minded Democrats. They see a candidate who entered the race with all the advantages of a frontrunner – near-universal name recognition, a prodigious fundraising operation and a message that still draws large, enthusiastic crowds – and yet has faced little scrutiny and relatively few attacks from his rivals. In recent weeks, many moderate Democrats have urged Sanders’ rivals to challenge his case for electability. In 2018, progressive candidates largely failed to prove they could build winning coalitions in swing districts and states. Many of the moderate House candidates who swept the Democrats to power by winning in Republican-held districts face tough re-elections and believe a Sanders nomination could jeopardize their majority, including a group of influential freshmen who recently endorsed Biden. A memo circulated by the centrist Third Way warns that nominating Sanders would result in “electoral carnage” on a scale not seen since 1984, when Ronald Reagan beat Walter Mondale by the widest electoral college margin in presidential history. Mondale carried only his home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia. Sanders’ team balks at such analysis, which they believes ignores more recent history. Hillary Clinton’s loss to Trump in 2016, they say, was the cost of playing it safe. A recent Fox News poll found Sanders defeating Trump by nearly the same margin as Biden in Wisconsin, perhaps the most critical 2020 battleground. To win, Sanders’ campaign says he must expand the electorate by turning out a coalition of people who vote infrequently or have never voted before, including young, working-class and minority voters. Sanders’ campaign knows it must do better, particularly among black voters, a critical Democratic constituency that prefers Biden by wide margins.     Bernie Sanders arrives for a campaign stop at Berg middle school on Saturday in Newton, Iowa. Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images    But his team argues that they are making progress. New polling has him running close behind Biden in Nevada, the first state with a large Hispanic electorate to vote in the primary. And he is leading the field in California, a state with a large Hispanic electorate that is also the largest prize of the Democratic nominating contests. And last quarter his campaign said it added 300,000 new donors and marked another milestone: it received more than 5 million donations, setting a new record for presidential candidates at this stage in the cycle. In the final weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Biden has started to consolidate support from establishment Democrats while Warren has started pitching herself as the candidate best positioned to unite a divided party. Unlike his rivals, Sanders must overcome deep skepticism from Democrats who still harbor reservations about his commitment to the party after years of agitating for change from the outside. Many Democrats who supported Clinton in 2016 still resent Sanders for dragging out the primary race and, in their view, not doing enough to help unify the party when the bitter contest was over. “Sanders has shown that he can fire up his base,” said Sean McElwee, the executive director of the liberal polling firm Data For Progress. “What he needs to show now is that he can persuade people to vote for him who right now are supporting Warren or Biden. He still needs to prove to Democrats that he can represent them and the party in a general election. That’s the big turn that he needs to make.”"
189,health,'I’m constantly putting on a brave face': farmers speak out on mental health,"When 20-year-old shepherd Ffion Hooson opened up on social media about her recent mental health struggles, she was overwhelmed by the response. Her father had suffered a stroke, leaving her to run their farm in Denbighshire, North Wales, alone. The responsibility and bad weather had crushed her to breaking point, she said. “I’m 20 years old and farming alone and I am constantly putting a brave hard face on … yet deep down I’m pretty much breaking inside … it’s the most I’ve struggled and no one really understands but I have no choice but to carry on,” she posted on Twitter.    I’m 20 years old and farming alone and I am constantly putting a brave hard face on... yet deep down I’m pretty much breaking inside... it’s the most I’ve struggled and no one really understands but I have no choice but to carry on😣😔 pic.twitter.com/n8keHhWci5&mdash; Ffion Hooson (@ffionhooson0) February 7, 2020    Hundreds of people jumped in to offer their help. “Who knew there were so many people out there to support what you’re doing,” said Hooson, adding that the responses made her feel “less alone”. Her situation has highlighted the stresses faced by many farmers, often working alone in extremely isolated locations. For years mental health in the farming sector has been an important topic – but now it is in the spotlight. An ‘anti-meat agenda’ The issue of meat consumption has been particular sensitive for farmers. This week the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) said that the “anti-meat agenda” had become an added strain on farmers’ mental health and that the demonising of livestock farmers was having “real-life consequences”. “People need to remember, at the heart of every farming business is a family. In a world where there seems to be increasing polarisation we mustn’t forget we’re all human,” said NFU president Minette Batters in a speech on Tuesday. Anna Jones, who runs the Just Farmers network, said she had witnessed a “collapse in self-confidence” among farmers due to the ongoing debates about veganism and farming in general. “They feel vilified and attacked all the time. And for them it is not just a job they do from 9–5, it’s their whole life.” Food policy academic Tim Lang, a former hill farmer himself, said while he was sympathetic to livestock farmers, there was no escaping the need to transition away from meat and dairy production and consumption. “It’s about a slow but inevitable re-structuring of land use and the role of farm animals within that. We’ve got to put farm animals back into a more appropriate ecological niche,” he said. Greenpeace said intensively-farmed meat locked consumers into destroying the world’s forests. “They’re being wiped out to grow crops like soya, 90% of which is used as animal feed for meat production. If we eat more grains, fruit and veg, and less meat, we get more food from less land and it reduces pressure on global forests,” said Chiara Vitali, Greenpeace UK forest campaigner. But it was big brands’ demands for ever more – and cheaper – produce that were to blame for this unsustainable system of industrial food production, not farmers, said Greenpeace, which called for livestock farmers to be supported to transition away from this type of farming, “not victimised”.“Being mindful of the detrimental role the current level of livestock production plays does not mean victimising farmers,” agreed Dr Marco Springmann, a researcher at the Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Food, who has published research on the necessity of low-meat diets to avoid dangerous levels of climate change. Devastating flood damage Other things have been adding to the pressures on farmers. A survey carried out by the Farm Safety Foundation this month found 84% of farmers aged under 40 believe mental health is the biggest hidden problem they face. In 2018, 83 suicides were registered among people working in agricultural and related trades including fishing and forestry in England and Wales.The recent floods and snowfall have created further strain and caused extensive damage to huge swaths of farmland across the country. Farming charities have set up crisis funds as they report increased numbers of calls from people struggling to cope with months of clean-up and uncertainty around future crop harvesting.“It is a business that has so many external factors beyond farmers’ control,” said Jude McCann, CEO of The Farming Community Network which has more than 400 volunteers throughout England and Wales providing free support.     Flooding this winter left some farms totally isolated. This Lincolnshire farm could only be reached by boat for two weeks. Photograph: Geoff Robinson/REX    Emma Picton-Jones, whose husband Daniel, an agricultural contractor in North Wales, killed himself in 2016, said isolation prevents many farmers from seeking help. “A lot of the reason people don’t open up is because they don’t see anyone. “There’s lots of other occupations with pressures and where people are self-employed, but with other trades like carpenters or builders you go to people’s houses and work with other tradespeople. Whereas farmers can go for a week without seeing anyone,” she said. Fear of letting the family down And Brexit has added to the financial pressures faced by many farmers with the UK Government phasing out the existing system of EU farm support payments from next year. More than 40% of UK farmers would have made a loss between 2014 and 2017 without the EU’s farm subsidy payments. Yet with many farmers running businesses that have been handed down over generations, there is a reluctance to be the one to leave the industry. “Farming is a family business that people have a huge amount of pride and attachment to. In other businesses people may just shut up shop and move out, but it’s not so easy to do that in farming,” said McCann. “Many don’t feel they can make that decision. It’s an emotional and irrational attachment that you don’t get in other businesses. Leaving the industry should not be seen as a failure or letting the family down.” Since her husband’s death, Emma has set up a charity to support people within the rural community suffering mental health difficulties. She says the response to Hooson’s call for help shows there has been a big step forward within the rural and farming community when it comes to talking about mental health.     ‘People need to remember, at the heart of every farming business is a family’, said NFU president Minette Batters. Photograph: Chris Strickland/Alamy    “People have told us they feel better from having seen conversations now taking place on social media or at auction marts.

190,health,Is there a right way to worry about coronavirus? And other mental health tips,"In the face of indefinite isolation, contagion, financial uncertainty, and with no return to normality in sight, coronavirus is taking its toll on our collective mental health.   Related: Can I have sex? A guide to intimacy during the coronavirus outbreak    Crisis Text Line, which operates in the US, UK and Canada, has seen a huge rise in volume since late February, and 80% of the texts it receives about coronavirus deal with anxiety. In these unprecedented times, what can people do to bring themselves a bit of mental relief? Acknowledge your anxiety  People deal with anxiety in ways that range from harmless to harmful – from binge-watching TV to comfort eating and alcohol. But the commonality is that these are ways of avoiding dealing with it, says psychiatrist Dr Richa Bhatia. First, she recommends acknowledging that anxiety, which is a normal evolutionary reaction to a perceived danger or threat. And Bhatia suggests trying to reframe anxiety as “a set of feelings, thoughts and emotions” rather than something defining to you or your life. “Feelings come and go and they will pass, and that’s what we have to remind ourselves when we are feeling anxious.” Schedule worrying  If the worry gets overwhelming, Bhatia recommends putting aside a set time for it, say 30 minutes a day. “This might seem counterintuitive, but it can actually help reduce worrying.” The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (ABCT) says setting a daily half-hour “worry period” at the same time and place helps to stay in the present moment the rest of the day. During the allotted slot it recommends “distinguishing between worries over which you have little or no control, and worries about problems you can influence.” Limiting daily news consumption may be wise. “If you’re losing sleep over what’s happening or you’re unable to concentrate on anything other than the risk that someone in your life has, you should probably consider [lowering] your dose of media to once a day,” says Dr Ken Duckworth, medical director of National Alliance on Mental Illness (Nami). Apps like Freedom, which enable you to block certain websites for specific time periods, can help with this. Reframe the situation You are not “stuck inside”. No, you are indulging in a long-awaited opportunity to slow down, focus on yourself and your home, writes psychologist Dr Aarti Gupta at the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. “Doing one productive thing per day can lead to a more positive attitude,” she writes. “Set your sights on long-avoided tasks, reorganize, or create something you’ve always wanted to.” Set quarantine rituals With all the additional time spent not commuting or getting to places, Gupta suggests using it to do something special with new rituals. This could entail a walk first thing in the morning, starting a journal, or speaking to a family member every morning on FaceTime. “Having something special during this time will help you look forward to each new day,” she writes. Get moving Exercise is a “classic anxiety reduction strategy”, says Duckworth. A review in the Journal of Happiness Studies found that those who exercise just one day a week may experience a happiness boost. It could be YouTube classes, a fitness app, cycling, jogging – and a New York club called Nowadays has created an online “virtual club” with live DJ sets every night. Small acts of altruism Helping others can give you a sense of purpose and control. Do you have an elderly or sick neighbor you can offer your services to? “The idea is to get out of the helpless zone if you can. If you can get out of that then be an agent,” says Duckworth. Physical distancing, not social distancing It goes without saying, but “loneliness is bad for humans,” says Duckworth. Have a coffee over FaceTime. Call your parents or kids every day.  While in some ways coronavirus is isolating, Bhatia says it is worth remembering that it’s a shared global experience. “Everybody’s affected to different degrees, but the bottom line is that everybody’s in it together, and scientists all over the world are trying to work on it together to find a solution quickly.” More resources  Mindful walking, breathing and eating for just a couple of minutes several times a day can help with anxiety, says Bhatia. The aim of mindfulness is to bring the mind to the present moment – or the process of trying to. Try mindfulness apps such as Calm and Headspace.   If you want to talk to a professional, many therapists are now doing appointments by phone or conference call. Bhatia recommends checking Psychology Today, which lists therapists in the US, UK and many other countries around the world, and the American Psychiatric Association. The UK Council for Psychotherapy and Australian Psychological Society are also good places to start.    Yale professor Laurie Santos’s happiness course, in which she explains the science of wellbeing, is available free on Coursera. She also has a podcast.   The Anxiety and Depression Association of America has a dedicated coronavirus page. In the UK, the Mental Health Foundation’s section on coronavirus is a helpful resource.

191,health,The Guardian view on inequality and health: a matter of life and death,"In the decade to 2010 life expectancy in England for the worst off increased by three years. In the last 10 years, according to a landmark study released on Tuesday, life expectancy has stalled for everyone in the country, the first levelling-off of health gains for a century. It is a national scandal that has poor women living shorter lives. In England, men in the poorest housing estates die, on average, nine and a half years earlier than those in the grandest homes. The poor in this country will not only die sooner, they will also spend more of their lives with a disability. In developed countries, death rates are supposed to decline. However, since 2011 there has been no sign of a decrease in mortality for people aged under 50. As the report warns: “If health has stopped improving it is a sign that society has stopped improving.” It is clear that something has gone very wrong. The question is what? Sir Michael Marmot, the author of the report, says that the slowdown in life expectancy improvements cannot be attributed solely to severe winters or flu. What Sir Michael’s work points to is that inequalities are a matter of life and death, of health and sickness, of wellbeing and misery. It is unfair that in England people in different social circumstances experience avoidable differences in health, wellbeing and length of life. Yet the poor odds of life’s lottery are a result of political choices made since 2010. What has happened in the last decade has been a significant erosion of power of those in the bottom half of society and a sharp increase in the power of those at the top. This transfer of power has coincided with an economic crisis: productivity growth, the source of a continued rise in the standard of living, has flatlined, and total average wages are still behind their pre-crash peak. Government spending as a percentage of GDP declined by seven percentage points between 2009-10 and 2018-19, from 42% to 35%. Time and time again, Conservative ministers have put the state at the service of the wealthy rather than the poor: more than 4 million children now live in poverty; Britain has higher income inequality and lower social mobility rates than many European peers; by 2016, the richest 1% owned 29 times what the bottom 20% own. Boris Johnson secured a Tory majority by winning seats in the “red wall” across the north of England. Yet the voters in many of these newly won constituencies are at the sharp end of health inequalities: women in these seats have average life expectancies four years lower than those in true-blue seats Mr Johnson held. The prime minister says he wants to level up the country, but nothing in his government’s policies suggests an acceptance that ill health is directly related to inequality. It is also unlikely, given past utterances, that he sees the need for early intervention. As an MP and cabinet minister he supported the cuts that withered the state so much that every child could not possibly flourish. The instinct of all British governments has been to help the poorest. This is a good thing. But ministers cannot just level up the chances of those at the very bottom of the pile; they must flatten the steep social gradient of health inequality. If ministers spend money only on improving things for the worst-off, then what happens to those just above the bottom, or at the median, who have worse health than those above them? This is not bureaucratic point-scoring. Around three in four people cannot expect to be disability-free at 68. So one has to address the inequalities for the bottom 75% of the country if you want to have a healthy population working at 68 – as envisaged by statute. Unless they are well off, improving a person’s health requires a weakening of the connection between their social position and health. People need to be able to take control of their lives in ways that enable them to influence their health. Sir Michael’s work shows that this is a much better strategy than targeting behaviour directly. Economic growth without reducing relative inequality will not lower health inequalities. There is more to inequality than just income. But, as the Nobel prize winner Amartya Sen has long argued, income inequalities affect the lives people are able to have. To lead flourishing lives, people need a fair society. • This article was amended on 25 February 2020. An earlier version said that a fall from 42% to 35% was a decline of 7%. It should have said a decline of seven percentage points. "
192,health,"Chronic pain: prescribe mental health support as well as drugs, say experts","People with chronic pain should be prescribed social interventions, such as mental health support instead of just opioid painkillers, experts have said. About 28 million adults in the UK live with pain that has lasted three months or more, according to recent research. But tackling such pain is challenging, with few effective treatments on offer. “For long-term pain there are no medical treatments that work really well – that is a harsh fact,” said Dr Cathy Stannard, clinical lead for guidelines on chronic pain from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. “Long-term pain is distressing and disabling, it is dreadful to live with, but medical treatments do not work to treat it.” GP prescriptions in England for opioids – drugs such as morphine and oxycodone – doubled in the 10 years to 2017, to 23.8m. Although more recent data shows a slight dip, the British Pharmacological Society says strength of prescriptions is rising. Unlike the US, the UK has not seen a sharp rise in deaths linked to prescription opioids, but concerns remain around addiction and side effects. While opioids are known to work for short-term pain, it is thought as few as one in 10 patients with chronic pain not linked to cancer may benefit from such drugs. Between 2017 and 2018, 5.6 million adults in England were taking opioids, with 540,000 having been taking them for at least three years. Now Stannard says it is time to rethink how chronic pain is handled, noting that when asked to rate their pain on a scale of one to 10, with 10 akin to torture, many patients rate their pain at 12. “That does not mean they are lying – what it means is they very, very much want help … The pain score is an articulation of distress,” she said.  Stannard said that not all relief comes in the form of medication. “Maybe we can’t change the pain, but we can do various things like we can improve mobility, we can improve sleep, we can improve social isolation, we can provide housing support, we can provide financial advice,” said Stannard, adding that such approaches can reduce reported pain.  “Our problem is that we treat pain as a medical thing, like hypertension, and what we use are drugs that interact with the pain pathway, and in fact we neglect the fact that pain is about so much more than that,” she added.   Related: Millions of people in England taking medicines they can find hard to stop    Although opioids fail to help 90% of those with chronic pain, Stannard says they should still be tried at least for an initial period of a few weeks to see if they work, and with patients made aware that they have only a small chance of helping. “The reason we don’t throw them out altogether is that for some people they are life-changing,” she said.  But pain management needs more than drugs, she said. “We know now there is a very close relationship between, for example, adverse childhood experience and adult chronic pain,” she said, adding that she had also seen cases where intense pain had been linked to grief. “It doesn’t mean that pain is any less real if there are profound emotional contributors,” Stannard said. But, she added, “if we had very easy open access to mental health support, we would prescribe much less.” Stannard said that opioids are overprescribed in the UK but the extent is unknown and the reasons are complex, stressing GPs are not simply “doling out drugs”. As well as a lack of access to mental health services, she said, doctors can feel pressured to prescribe opioids even though they expect them to bring little benefit, because of the distress and desperation of the patient in front of them. “If I see someone who says: ‘So, you are going to leave me in pain then,’ that is an existential threat to my identity as a healthcare professional,” said Stannard. “If somebody comes into a clinic being distressed, it is very difficult to say you are not going to help.”"
193,health,"'The army is our friend' against coronavirus in remote communities, Aboriginal health group says","Australia’s peak Aboriginal health group, representing hundreds of health care services, wants state and territory governments to make urgent arrangements to protect Aboriginal people in remote areas who are highly vulnerable to Covid-19. 
The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (Naccho) said governments should consider deploying the army in remote areas, where health workers face major challenges in containing any outbreak, including a lack of access to equipment, testing and urgent emergency care. 
“Everybody has to step up, that’s how serious this is,” the Naccho CEO, Pat Turner, said.

“State and territory governments need to do everything they can to stop this getting into our communities. If this gets into any remote community, there will be a high rate of deaths. Our communities will be devastated, because of the already low levels of health. 
“The army is our friend in this situation. They have the necessary resources, and we should be briefing army health co-ordinators and have them on standby to be deployed [to places that] we have difficulty reaching, helping us manage this pandemic,” Turner said. 
Remote-area health workers urgently need more personal protective equipment, she said, after receiving reports that clinics in the Kimberley region of Western Australia had received only two sets each of masks, gloves and gowns for healthcare staff to use. 
 
  
  
   
    Who needs to isolate?
    
    The Australian government announced new travel restrictions to try to slow the spread of coronavirus on 15 March. From midnight, all returning Australians and overseas visitors are required to isolate themselves for 14 days after arriving in the country.
    People who have been in close contact with somebody diagnosed coronavirus are already required to self-isolate.
    
    What does self-isolation mean?
    
    Self-isolation starts when you arrive in Australia, with the federal department of health recommending you use personal transport, such as a car, to travel home or to your hotel from the airport, to minimise exposure to others.
    &nbsp;“If you need to use public transport (e.g. taxis, ride-hail services, trains, buses and trams), follow the precautions outlined in the public transport guide.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;“During the 14 days of isolation, you must stay at home or in your hotel and don’t go to public places including work, school, childcare, university or public gatherings. Only people who usually live with you should be in the home. Do not see visitors.”
    &nbsp;“Ask others who are not in isolation to get food and necessities for you. If you must leave home, such as to seek medical care, wear a surgical mask. If you don’t have a mask, take care to not cough or sneeze on others.”
    &nbsp;“If you live in a private house, it is safe for you to go into your garden or courtyard. If you live in an apartment or are staying in a hotel, it is also safe for you to go into the garden but you should wear a surgical mask to minimise risk to others and move quickly through any common areas.”
    
    What if I feel sick?
    
    The health department recommends monitoring yourself for symptoms including “fever, cough or shortness of breath. Other early symptoms include chills, body aches, sore throat, runny nose and muscle pain.”
    &nbsp;“If you develop symptoms (fever, a cough, sore throat, tiredness or shortness of breath) within 14 days of returning to Australia or within 14 days of last contact of a confirmed case, you should arrange to see your doctor for urgent assessment. You should telephone the health clinic or hospital before you arrive and tell them your travel history or that you may have been in contact with a potential case of coronavirus.”
    
    Limiting the spread at home
    
    The health department recommends practising good hand and sneeze/cough hygiene as the best defence against most viruses.
    &nbsp;It also advises regular cleaning of household surfaces.
    &nbsp;“To minimise the spread of any germs you should regularly wash surfaces that are frequently touched such as door handles, light switches, kitchen and bathroom areas. Clean with household detergent or disinfectant.

Turner said the equipment is essential for remote workers because timely testing is not available and they are relying on clinical diagnosis of Covid-19. 
“It can take up to two weeks for tests to be returned, and in that time, if someone has it, the whole community will get it,” Turner said. 
Local and state governments must prepare isolation and quarantine centres, she said, because “self-isolation is just unrealistic where there’s overcrowding in housing because of decades and decades of government neglect. 
 
  Related: Australian state governments declare public health emergencies to contain coronavirus  
 
“Local and state governments need to be working with local communities to identify structures that can be adapted for isolation, and they need two kinds: one for suspected cases, and the other for people who are known to have it.” 
Naccho is providing a briefing for the Aboriginal taskforce on Covid-19, which will report to the national cabinet tomorrow. 
“The national cabinet meeting tomorrow should realise the seriousness of this for Aboriginal Australia and make sure the necessary resources are provided immediately,” Turner said. 
“We need information urgently on what to do in every situation. Our health services need to know.” 
Naccho represents 143 Aboriginal community-controlled health services across the country. 
On the weekend, the Northern Land Council (NLC) suspended all existing non-essential permits to visit Aboriginal lands, and said it won’t grant any new ones until further notice. 
“The NLC has received many calls from community members asking that we do all we can to ensure the safety and protection of Aboriginal people,” the CEO, Marion Scrymgour, said. 
“This decision will not affect the permits issued to doctors, nurses, teachers, police officers, council workers and others that provide essential services for Aboriginal people out bush,” she said. 
The NLC and Naccho have both called on the federal government to consider the concerns of the traditional Aboriginal owners of Kakadu national park, who say it should close immediately. Parks Australia has been contacted for comment. 
On the Tiwi Islands, the weekend’s AFL grand final and art fair, which usually draw thousands of visitors, were closed to outsiders. 
The Northern Territory government said it is implementing current national advice for self-isolation of 14 days for all international arrivals and a ban on cruise ships for 30 days. Government schools across the Northern Territory will remain open. 
It has produced health announcements in nine Aboriginal languages, including Warlpiri and Yolngumatha, and set up a hotline for territory residents: 1800 008 002. 
There is one confirmed case of Covid-19 in the Northern Territory: a tourist who is currently in Royal Darwin hospital."
194,health,The coronavirus lays bare the limits of WHO's health diplomacy with China,"On social media this week the insults were flying thick and fast, some tinged with racism, but all with a common theme: how the World Health Organization, and its head, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was effectively doing the bidding of the Chinese government in the midst of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak. It is a charge that has also been expressed in less offensive terms elsewhere in columns and articles, some of which have focused on whether, in praising China’s response to the deadly Wuhan coronavirus outbreak during a visit to Beijing, Tedros allowed himself to become complicit in China’s flawed handling of the outbreak in its early days? In some respects, it is a hoary old paradox, familiar to many international bodies and NGOs. How – when dealing with a health crisis or a humanitarian disaster – you are limited in the choice and nature of your partners in the place where it is occurring, and the limitations they impose. But if the politics of such accommodations is always uncomfortable, the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak encapsulates in a stark fashion a number of difficult issues. Above all, it asks how the UN’s international health diplomacy, confronted with a potential pandemic where a timely and accurate flow of information is crucial, should interact with one of the world’s most powerful, and controlling, states. Looming above all else is the fact that China is a country whose trajectory under Xi Jinping has been to become more, not less, authoritarian, marked by mass internment camps for Uighurs, a growing internet crackdown and its harsh response to street protests in Hong Kong. There seems little doubt either that China’s bureaucratic culture of control and secrecy, including the local government’s efforts to clamp down on the information emerging about the disease in the first weeks of the epidemic, contributed to its initial spread in December and the first weeks of January. It is also true that after admitting the scale of the problem, China has shared much information internationally, in line with its commitments, about the nature and spread of the virus, and deployed unprecedented and costly national efforts in a bid to contain the outbreak, even as it has employed what many would see as draconian restrictions.    😷 TaCo editorial cartoon: World Health Organization&#39;a (@WHO) words vs. the truth about China (dead people in the streets).https://t.co/miZ5oq59WL#2019nCoV#WuhanCoronavirus#武漢肺炎 pic.twitter.com/yiX8FT99d5&mdash; Tâi Siáu-káu (台痟狗) ㄊㄇㄉ 🇳🇫 Taiwan 🌏 😷 (@TimMaddog) February 3, 2020    Interposed into the midst of all this has been the WHO – and Tedros – a relationship complicated by the fact that China is a major donor to the world health body. The mix of health and international politics has been underlined by the exclusion of Taiwan from discussions even after the coronavirus spread there. The argument about how the WHO has negotiated the complexities boils down to several key questions. The first is whether the organisation should have pushed harder for Beijing to be more forthcoming when evidence of a new form of coronavirus first emerged, but before the scale of the outbreak was fully acknowledged. And whether the head of the UN body should have been so warm in praising the response of a country that unsettles so many for its secrecy and rights violations. In particular, the fraught politics of the WHO declaring the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) has once again come under the spotlight in the same way it did during the Ebola crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Some of those most critical have parsed Xi’s meeting with Tedros – and Xi’s declared hope that the UN body would assess the “epidemic situation in an objective, just, calm and reasonable way” – as pressure from Beijing to ensure WHO would refrain from designating the epidemic a global health emergency to protect China’s economy. Although that didn’t happen, the WHO’s advice – contrary to that of many governments – is that it still “advises against the application of any restrictions of international traffic based on the information currently available on this event”. And on this front some are pointing to a startling contradiction: how the UN body has praised the extreme internal travel restrictions in China while criticising other countries for implementing their own travel measures.   Related: The disease always gets a head start: how to handle an epidemic    Sources familiar with the politics at the top of the organisation, and the decision over declaring the outbreak a PHEIC, insist that WHO have had to balance very difficult issues. With China’s well-known history of extreme sensitivity to criticism, the argument goes, a conscious decision was made to prioritise diplomacy that would encourage China to be as open as possible in sharing information with international researchers and health bodies even at the risk of drawing inevitable criticism. “China was very quick to let the WHO know what was happening on 31 December,” said one close observer. “The organisation’s goal was to get as much information about what was happening in China to inform what the rest of the world would need to do. “It’s clear there were two options: to keep pressing behind the scenes, or to go public and say at a press conference we didn’t get such and such at this time and for the Chinese to lose face and slam the door. So it seems like a deliberate decision to keep the flow of data coming, to encourage the Chinese to keep focused on the epicentre, even at the risk of being seen in public as kissing up to Beijing.” And while insiders point to China’s preparedness to come clean and admit mistakes once its central government had realised the scale of the threat, critics counter that greater pressure from WHO might have made that moment come days earlier, potentially helping contain the epidemic at an earlier stage. In the end, whether the current diplomacy was the right approach in balancing the demands of human rights and global risk and the threat to China’s (and the world’s) economy and prestige, only the course of the outbreak will confirm."
195,health,Too few counsellors on campus: why students are turning to mental health apps,"Leaving friends and family at home and building a new life in a different city can be tough – especially for the first time. Throw in the stresses of university work, and it’s little wonder that many students feel the strain. One in five students have a mental health diagnosis, according to a recent survey of nearly 40,000 students. Nearly half say they’re often anxious, and a third are frequently lonely. There’s no question that there’s a student mental health crisis on campus – the challenge is how to deal with it. The obvious answer is upping the number of counsellors on campus, but with budgets tightening at lots of universities, this isn’t always easy. Sara Elkhawad, welfare officer at Newcastle University students’ union, says counselling will inevitably be underfunded. “We have 28,000 students, and only so many counsellors. Even if you increase the number of counsellors by 10, it’s only going to help a certain number of students.”   Related: Snake oil or panacea: can technology improve student mental health?    To plug the gap, a number of universities, including Newcastle, are starting to promote apps to help manage students’ mental health or offer support and guidance. But do they work? Amelia Trew, student wellbeing officer at the University of East Anglia, believes the apps are “empowering” because they allow students to take control of their wellbeing in their own time. She encourages students to use different apps for different purposes: for instance, its in-house app OpenUpUEA is focused on wellbeing, while another, Enlitened, acts as more of an academic support service. Lots of students have welcomed the additional support that apps offer. “It’s just a platform to express what you’re feeling in an anonymous way. I think of the app as a first step in getting help,” says Victoria Williams, an English student at Exeter University. “For some people, going to a wellbeing centre or speaking to a mental health expert can be quite daunting.” Many students find this intuitive as they are accustomed to interacting with friends on their phones, says Elkhawad. Apps can also benefit autistic students, who can be more comfortable communicating through phones than face-to-face. “There is this narrative of counselling being the only way to [make] mental health improvements or better yourself, and it’s fundamentally wrong,” she says. “It’s really difficult speaking to someone you’ve never met before in your life about your personal issues.” But some students are less convinced. “It’s quite patronising for people to assume [that apps are] how you tackle such a complicated and nuanced problem,” says Martha Griffiths, a University of East Anglia student who has experienced mental health problems. “When you come down to severe mental health crises, apps can’t help with that. They can’t give you what students need, which is actual contacts and serious support. It’s a great way of universities saying they’re doing something without addressing the serious problem.” Til Wykes, professor of clinical psychology and rehabilitation at King’s College London, shares some of Griffiths’s concerns. “Many [apps] haven’t been tested in a randomised controlled trial,” she says. Indeed, a recent study by American and Australian academics found that only around one in 33 mental health apps had research to justify their claims of effectiveness. Just three in 10 claimed to have expert input in development, and only 20% were tied to a government body, academic institution or hospital. Wykes believes that apps can have a place in monitoring and treating mental health, but that they should be in addition to, rather than in place of, more traditional counselling and advice services. “If you talk to people, they actually say they’re happy to interact with an app but not if that means they won’t have access to a person if they need it,” she says. Part of the problem is that mental health apps are often developed by non-experts. Wykes worries that designers are driven by the wrong incentives: they want to find ways to keep people using the app, despite the fact that excessive phone use has been linked to mental health problems. She also worries that apps are often designed without consulting people who have experienced mental illness.  “It’s quite well documented in literature that many mental health apps don’t have that good evidence or peer-reviewed research to back up what they do,” admits Tim Rogers, clinical director at Big White Wall, which connects 25,000 students across 80 UK universities with peer support overseen by trained monitors. He adds: “However, that’s not universal, and things are changing.”   Related: 'It removes stigma': how tech breaks down barriers for students with disabilities    Apps are necessary, he argues, because of the strain on existing mental health services. For example, the NHS runs an Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme to help people access to talking therapies. “One of the goals of IAPT is to reach about 25% of people who have a mental health problem,” says Rogers. “But what that means is 75% of people who have mental health issues don’t benefit from face-to-face talking treatment. Even if you threw all the money in the world at the problem, you’d need to find the right numbers of suitably qualified psychological therapists of different kinds, and that’s an issue too.” Technology, then, can ease the problem – but it shouldn’t be the only solution. Elkhawad sees students coming in daily to access welfare and wellbeing services, and is generally sceptical of technological quick fixes. “It’s not a binary, one-or-the-other system of mental health support,” she says. “There are lots of options we should be promoting and investing in equally, rather than giving loads of support to one and nothing for the other.”"
196,health,Gwyneth Paltrow’s risible pseudo-science is the least of our health concerns,"Does the NHS chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, think British people take Gwyneth Paltrow and Goop seriously? Does even Paltrow take herself seriously? In a speech, Stevens referenced Goop as he criticised “quacks, charlatans and cranks” in the wellness industry. While making serious points about the dangers of the anti-vaccination movement, he railed against “dubious wellness products and dodgy procedures”, going on to mention “jade eggs and unusually scented candles… and a new TV series in which [Paltrow] and her team test vampire facials”. Quite. Goop is infamous for its ludicrous, expensive quackery. But since when did it masquerade as a viable alternative to the NHS? I doubt I’m in Goop’s target market – I’m too old and cynical. When I had a quick peek at The Goop Lab with Gwyneth Paltrow on Netflix, it was just as I’d expected – a bunch of earnest yoga-hippies in overpriced stretchy clobber with too much Me!-time on their hands, to whom you could probably sell Tower Bridge if you dabbed enough patchouli oil on it. This kind of thing adheres rather too closely to the “eat, pray, embrace your narcissism” belief system, but if people are absolutely determined to shove jade eggs where the sun doesn’t shine, then how are we to stop them?   Related: Do not adjust your set: Gwyneth Paltrow is spreading Goop all over TV    For all that some of us recoil at the excesses of Goop (I will doubtless thrash about on my deathbed, hallucinating and screaming: “No, Gwynnie, please don’t steam my vagina!”), is anyone actively being misled? Goop is clear that it covers “emerging topics that may be unsupported by science”. That it sells fantasy, entertainment, indulgence, diversion – as opposed to, say, a fully functioning A&amp;E department. Arguably the saving grace of the Zen hard sell of Goop is its modicum of self-awareness; it knows it has naff all to do with health. It’s just a wellness brand – expecting it to hold to scientific/medical criteria is like expecting a lip gloss to do a handstand. Stevens was right to blast Goop products and philosophies, but did he think the rest of us hadn’t noticed? Add those prohibitive prices into the mix and it becomes yet clearer that Goop is far too expensive and elitist to have too much impact on the real world. This is what makes Stevens’s attack seem a little overheated, though perhaps I should cut him some slack. It must be simpler and easier for a chief executive to rail against Goop than to give a speech about all the huge, real and complex problems (not least under-funding and dismantling) facing the NHS. As for Paltrow, it’s doubtful she’d be alarmed by the criticism. Her recent marketing wheeze, the instantly notorious “smells like my vagina” candle, confirmed my long-held suspicion that, never mind the acting background, or even the multizillion-dollar wellness brand, Gwyneth Paltrow, a woman clearly not without humour, should be congratulated on yet another successful career as a world-class provocatrice. And Donald Trump’s wall came tumbling down     Workers rebuild a section of the border wall between the US and Mexico, after part of it fell over. Photograph: STRINGER/Reuters    Oh no, part of President Trump’s wall has blown over in the wind. One of his key electoral promises was to build a wall between Mexico and America. “I would build a great wall,” he said Trump.. “And nobody builds walls better than me.” Psst, Donald, when you said “nobody” there, did you mean pre-schoolers armed only with Play-Doh and lollipop sticks? The affected section of wall was about 130ft long, and fell on to trees on the Mexican side. I say “wall”, but Trump’s plans have been repeatedly scaled back. It appears to have been downgraded to iron panels slapped on to gaps in the existing border – a bit like when you put a bin against a hole in the fence to stop the dog getting out. Elsewhere, the “wall” turned into 14 miles of wooden slatted fencing, which suggests there must have been one hell of a sale going on at whatever passes for Homebase now in America. So far, on the Build a Wall scoreboard, I make that Mexicans 1, Trump 0. Trump hasn’t built a wall, he’s just patched up the old barrier. While the cost has been criticised (Trump just tried to divert a further $7.2bn from the Pentagon’s budget), the result has been mocked, not least by an eight-year-old girl who was videoed breezily climbing an 18ft replica of Trump’s “virtually impenetrable” wall, built in a rock-climbing park in Kentucky. Another man climbed the replica wall while juggling with one hand. It’s reported that the wall fell because the cement holding it failed to stiffen. So the plot thickened but the cement didn’t? As Trump is enduring all kinds of nightmarish structural collapses at the moment, it would be unseemly to mock. Where the collapse of Trump’s wall is concerned, let’s just sit back, relax, and enjoy the metaphor. Turns out it was flu, not Brexit: I wasn’t remoaning, just moaning     ‘You’re welcome to your Brexit, sickness and all’. Photograph: Robert Perry/EPA    It’s a turning point all right – no more allowing Brexit to screw with my health (mental or physical). I’ve just had flu, and I didn’t even realise it. I thought I had a cold, on top of feeling drained and down about Brexit day. I only realised it was flu when others caught it from me. All the things I’d put down to Brexit (low mood, exhaustion, heavy limbs, headaches, disturbed sleep, breathlessness, spaciness) were illness. I hadn’t come down with Brexit after all. In some ways, it’s funny – once, I might have overdone the partying, now it’s remoaning too hard. Still, it’s yet another side-effect of leaving – even as people report Brexit-related stress and depression, others like me ignore genuine flu symptoms, thinking: “It’s just Brexit.” Well, enough of that. I’m sick (literally, it appears) of feeling “owned” by someone else’s Brexit. People like myself (Remainers, rejoiners, delusional, call us what you will) have to learn to pace ourselves, which in no way means giving up. We need to keep an eye on The Situation but, from now on, let the Tories, and all other Leavers, take responsibility for the worry and stress of it all. If this was your Brexit, then you’re more than welcome to it, sickness and all. • Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist"
197,health,Health minister Greg Hunt lobbied for gender and sexuality questions in census,"Health minister Greg Hunt lobbied his cabinet colleague Michael Sukkar to include gender and sexuality questions in the census – despite Sukkar’s intervention to have the politically sensitive questions dumped from the census test. In a letter to the Victorian equality minister, Martin Foley, earlier in January, Hunt revealed he had written to Sukkar, the assistant treasurer, in support of the inclusion of questions that would “greatly inform the government’s knowledge about the LGBTI+ population cohort in Australia in the 2021 census”. Hunt’s support for the questions is significant as it is the first sign of dissent at the cabinet level over Sukkar’s position against asking Australians their gender and sexuality in the upcoming census.   Related: Liberal MP calls for sexuality questions in census after ABS dumped them on minister’s guidance    Gender and sexuality questions were among eight potential new topics identified by consultation in 2018 and were set to be included in a census test late last year. In October Guardian Australia revealed the Australian Bureau of Statistics had dumped the questions from the test after intervention from the assistant treasurer’s office, prompting backlash from stakeholders including the LGBTI Health Alliance. In December, Foley wrote to Sukkar lobbying him to include the questions. In a letter, seen by Guardian Australia, Hunt replied by saying the federal government is “committed to supporting the mental health and wellbeing of LGBTI+ people”. “To that end I have written to the assistant treasurer to signal my support for the inclusion of questions that would greatly inform the government’s knowledge about the LGBTI+ population cohort in Australia in the 2021 census.” He acknowledged that “LGBTI+ Australians often have unique healthcare needs and are at an increased risk of poor health outcomes and mental health issues”. “From a health systems perspective, access to a more complete and nationally inclusive data collection would assist the Australian government to inform the development of policies that ensure access to appropriate health services for all Australians,” Hunt said. Foley, who is also the minister for mental health, has written to concerned stakeholders noting that Hunt’s reply “suggests these issues are still under consideration” at the federal level. Foley said he was disturbed to see “the increasingly deliberate politicisation of LGBTIQ issues in the public arena”, arguing this contributes to mental health issues for LGBTIQ people. “We remain committed to opposing moves to wind back hard-fought discrimination protections for our LGBTIQ communities.” Foley told Guardian Australia it is “disappointing – but sadly unsurprising – to see the [federal government] is once again divided over such an important issue, letting party politics get in the way of improving the lives of LGBTIQ Australians”. “Not counting LGBTIQ Australians in the 2021 census would send a message that the commonwealth believes these people should remain invisible,” he said. “We know LGBTIQ people are over-represented in poorer economic, housing, health and mental health outcomes – comprehensive demographic data would be one of the best tools we have to improve these measures, so all levels of government can tailor health and social services to better suit their needs.” “If the commonwealth really care about suicide prevention and mental health they must take this important step in helping to reduce stigma and discrimination for LGBTIQ Australians.” Stephen Jones, Labor’s shadow assistant treasurer, said it is clear Sukkar’s position is “driven by ideology” and Scott Morrison should intervene to ensure the questions are included.  “To do otherwise would be to deny agencies important information needed for health planning purposes,” he said. “The census can’t be a political football.” The ABS has recommended the government not put a new question on sexual orientation into the 2021 census, despite acknowledging that two federal departments including the health department need the data to deliver services and it would have “strong value across all levels of government”. Documents produced to the Senate reveal that despite extensive consultation with LGBTI health groups about questions on sexual orientation and gender identity and an “identified need” for sexuality data, the ABS believed the potential new topics were too sensitive and risked public backlash.   Related: More data on ethnic diversity 'critical' to unlock Australia's potential    In December LGBTI Health Alliance executive director, Nicky Bath, said the ABS recommendation was “disappointing” because of the “great need” for gender and sexuality data which should be put above “the politics and individual viewpoints”. The decision about new questions for the 2021 census will be made at cabinet level, with a decision expected to be tabled in parliament in 2020. Since becoming prime minister in August 2018, Scott Morrison has been criticised by LGBTI equality advocates for politicising sexuality and gender identity. Morrison has opposed sex education programs he agreed made his “skin curl” by teaching the fact of diversity in human sexuality, described teachers who support trans students as “gender whisperers” and demanded his department remove signage that gives people the choice of bathroom based on their gender identity. Sukkar and Morrison both opposed same-sex marriage during the postal survey campaign, then abstained when the bill passed parliament. Sukkar also charged taxpayers almost $1,500 to attend a campaign rally against same-sex marriage."
198,health,Boris Johnson calls coronavirus 'worst public health crisis for a generation' – as it happened," 
  7.06pm GMT  
 Boris Johnson's press conference - Summary 
  
  Here are the main points from the news conference. Boris Johnson was joined by Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser.  
   
   Johnson said that Britain was facing the “worst public health crisis for a generation” and that “many more” people would die. (See 5.52pm.) In a marked change of tone from his previous press conferences and interviews on this subject, he explained that Britons were going to face considerable disruption to ordinary life over the next few months as the government introduced measures to delay and limit the spread of Covid-19. 
   
   
   Johnson said the true number of coronavirus cases in the population was probably “much higher” than official figures suggest. He said: 
   
   
   The number of cases will rise sharply, indeed the true number of cases is higher - perhaps much higher - than the number of cases we have so far confirmed with tests. 
   
  Vallance said he thought the actual number of people infected in the UK at the moment could be between 5,000 and 10,000. The official number of confirmed cases is 596. 
   
   Johnson confirmed that the UK was now moving out of the “contain” phase and into the “delay” phase for dealing with the epidemic. He said: 
   
   
   This is now not just to attempt to contain the disease as far as possible, but to delay its spread and thereby minimise the suffering. If we delay the peak even by a few weeks, then our NHS will be in a stronger state as the weather improves and fewer people suffer from normal respiratory diseases, more beds are available and we’ll have more time for medical research. We can also act to stretch the peak of the disease over a longer period so that our society is better able to cope. 
   
   
   Johnson said that people with a fever or a new, persistent cough were now being asked to stay at home for seven days. He also said schools were being advised to cancel overseas trips, and the over-70s and the ill were being told to avoid cruises. He said: 
   
   
   From tomorrow, if you have coronavirus symptoms, however mild -- either a new continuous cough or a high temperature -- then you should stay at home for at least 7 days to protect others and help slow the spread of the disease. We advise all those over 70 and those with serious medical conditions against going on cruises and we advise against international school trips.  
   
   
   He said that at some point in the future the government would go further, and ask all family members to stay at home if someone was ill. He said: 
   
   
   At some point in the next few weeks we are likely to go further and if someone in a household has those symptoms then we will be asking everyone in that household will stay at home. 
   
  He also said that at some point in the future the elderly would be asked to stay away from places or people to avoid infection. He did not give details. 
   
   He said at the moment he was not planning to ban sporting events, but he said this was being kept under review. He said: 
   
   
   We are considering the question of banning major public events such as sporting fixtures. And the scientific advice, as we’ve said over the last couple of weeks, is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread but there’s also the issue of the burden that such events can place on public services. 
   
  In a mild dig at Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister who is planning to cancel events with crowds of more than 500 people from next week and whose decision to announce the results of the Cobra meeting before Johnson angered some in No 10, Johnson said that Scotland might have a particular issue with the resilience of its emergency services. He implied that that was why the Scots needed a different policy. Vallance said cancelling sporting events could be counterproductive. He explained: 
   
   On average, one person infects two or three others. 
   You therefore have a very low probability of infecting a large number of people in a stadium and a rather higher probability of infecting people very close to you. 
   And that means that most of the transmission actually tends to take place with friends and colleagues and those in close environments - and not in the big environments. 
   Though it is true that any cancellation of things can have some effect, if you then get a displacement activity where you end up with everyone congregating somewhere else, you may actually perversely have an increased risk, particularly in an indoor environment. 
   So it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t at some point make the decision from a resilience point but this is not a major way to tackle this epidemic. 
   
   
   Johnson defended his decision not to introduce measures as draconian as those being introduced in some other other countries. He said: 
   
   
   The measures that I have discussed today... staying at home if you think you have the symptoms, your whole household staying at home, looking after the elderly - making sure the elderly and vulnerable stay at home - these are the three most powerful defensive lines. 
   We think it’s very important to maintain public trust and confidence in what we are doing, throughout this challenging time, always to be guided by the best possible scientific advice. 
   
  He and his advisers also argued that, if self-isolation measures were introduced too early, they would be ineffective - because people would ignore them at the point where they were most necessary. 
   
   Whitty said he thought the overall mortality rate from Covid-19 was around 1% or less. It was higher for older people, and people in the vulnerable group, and lower for others, he said. But he said he did not want to speculate on who many people might die from the illness because he said the scientists just did not know how many people are infected. He said, although an 80% infection rate was the government’s top reasonable worst case scenario, nowhere in the world was currently coming close to an infection level like that. 
   
   
   Vallance said that the outbreak in the UK could be about four weeks behind the outbreak in Italy.  
   
   
   Vallance said the peak of the epidemic in the UK was “something like 10 to 14 weeks away”. 
   
  That’s all from me for today. 
  Thanks for the comments.

  The Nigel Farage critique of Boris Johnson (see 6.08pm) is still very much a minority view at Westminster. That could change very quickly, of course, and it was noticeable that the questions posed by the media at the press conference this afternoon were a bit more hostile than at the press conference on Monday, or the one he did on Tuesday last week. But the opposition parties have been broadly supportive of the government’s approach, and some YouGov polling last week (pdf) said more people thought Johnson was handling this well (49%) than badly (32%).  
  Some of the journalists who watched the press conference were reasonable impressed. Here is some reaction.

 Johnson warns UK: 'Many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time' 
  
  This is what Boris Johnson said at the start of his press conference. In a marked change of tone from the previous press conferences and interviews he has given on this subject, he said that this was the worst public health crisis for a generation and that “many more” people would die. He said: 
   
   It’s clear that coronavirus Covid-19 continues and will continue to spread across the world and our country over the next few months. 
   We’ve done what can be done to contain this disease, and this has bought us valuable time, but it’s now a global pandemic. 
   The number of cases will rise sharply, indeed the true number of cases is higher - perhaps much higher - than the number of cases we have so far confirmed with tests. 
   We’ve all got to be clear, this is the worst public health crisis for a generation. 
   Some people compare it to seasonal flu, alas that is not right. 
   Due to the lack of immunity this disease is more dangerous. 
   It is going to spread further and I must level with you, I must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time. 
   
  Full summary coming soon.

  Johnson is winding up now. 
  He ends by repeating the point about how if anyone has a high temperature, or a new and continuous cough, they should stay at home. 
  That is the way to “squash the sombrero”, he says, referring to the graph illustrating the peak (see below). 
  And that’s it. I will post a summary and reaction shortly. 
   
    
    
    Sir Patrick Vallance with a graph showing the shape of an epidemic

  5.39pm GMT  
  
  Q: How confident are we in the data? 
  Johnson says some countries are having some success in greatly reducing the incidence of the disease. 
  He says there are measures that could be taken of a draconian nature. But that might just lead to the disease surging back, he says. 
  Whitty says there are some things we are very confident of, like the mortality rate. 
  But we don’t know how many people get the disease without symptoms. 
  He says, depending on what the answer to that is, the disease has very different outcomes. 
  
 
 
  5.37pm GMT  
  
  Q: When do you think older people will be asked to stay at home? And how old is old? 
  Vallance says the peak is probably 10 to 14 weeks away, maybe longer. Even to cover the peak, you would need to ensure that those sorts of measures would be in place for 12 or 13 weeks or so. 
  Whitty say people may get individual advice from their GP. But national guidance will also be issued at the appropriate time, he says. 
  
 
 
  5.35pm GMT  
  
  Q: What do you mean by people volunteering? 
  Johnson says he hopes people will think of their neighbours, and consider what they can do to help them. The advice is not to go within two metres of them. 
  Vallance says the behavioural science says, at times like this, you see an outbreak of altruism. 
  Q: You said we were four week behind Italy. Might we have to introduce Italian-style measures? 
  Vallance says the UK may be four weeks behind in terms of the scale of the outbreak. You would expect it to follow a similar trajectory in terms of numbers.. What they are proposing today are measures to deflect that, he says. 
  
 
 
  5.33pm GMT  
  
  Q: Are you planning any register to help people volunteer? 
  Johnson says Matt Hancock is setting up a system for people who want to come back to the NHS to offer their services. 
  
 
 
  5.32pm GMT  
  
  Q: Some workers will not be covered by our statutory sick pay issue. Could you extend SSP? 
  Johnson says the government is changing benefits rules. It will do everything necessary to ensure people are not penalised for doing the right thing. 
  Q: Are you worried about getting it yourself? You have to meet a lot of people in your job. And who would step in if you were incapacitated? 
  Johnson just says he is washing his hands. 
  
 
 
  5.30pm GMT  
  
  Johnson asks Vallance to address the point about whether stopping flights is effective. 
  Vallance says, when they looked at this in reduction to China, they thought at best stopping flights would delay the disease by a day or two. 
  And he says screening at airports sound sensible. But in the US the first case went through screening. 
  On sports events, he says a single individual on average infects two or three others. 
  That means there is a very low probability of infecting a large number of people in a studium. 
  Most infection takes places when people are with friends, not when they are in large groups. 
  That means, perversely, banning large events could be counter-productive. 
  He says the way to fight this is to reduce infection across households and across people who are affected. 
  
 
 
  5.27pm GMT  
  
  Q: Can you understand why people watching this will think you are doing little, when they look at the kind of things happening in Ireland? 
  Johnson says he is guided by the best scientific advice. 
  Q: The German chancellor said 70% of people could get this. Do you agree? And how many people might die? 
  Vallance says getting people to stay at home will give you a 20 to 25% reduction in the peak. 
  And he says isolating the elderly can reduce the death rate by about 30%, he says. 
  He says it is important not to go to things that sound sensible, but have little effect. 
  And you don’t want to introduce measures that only apply for a week or two, he says. To be effective, these measure will have to last longer. 
  Whitty says closing schools has big knock-on effects for the whole of society. 
  On numbers, Whitty says he has been absolute level with the public on numbers on which he has confidence. 
  He says his top planning assumption is 80% of people getting the illness. 
  He says he and Vallance agree on a mortality rate of 1% - which would be higher for vulnerable groups, and lower for other groups. 
  But he says what he does not want to do is give a figure for how many people have been affected. He says he does not want to do that because he does not know the numbers. 
  
 
 
  5.21pm GMT  
  
  Whitty says asking people to stay at home with minor symptoms sounds easy. 
  But in practice it will be harder for people than they think. 
  
 
 
  5.20pm GMT  
  
  Johnson is now taking questions. 
  Q: How sure are you that your approach is right? 
  Johnson says he is guided by science in everything he does. 
  He returns to the point about elderly people. He says you need to time the period of isolation for them at the point where they are most at risk. 
  He says in Scotland there is a particular issue with the resilience of public services. In the UK this issue will have to be kept under review too, he says. 
  He says the UK government is not saying no to the sort of measure announced by Nicola Sturgeon. (See 12.57pm.) 
  
 
 
  5.17pm GMT  
  
  Whitty says the government is also looking at mitigation measures. 
  First, that involves reducing the peak. 
  And, second, that involves increasing the capacity of the NHS. 
  
 
 
  5.16pm GMT  
  
  Whitty says, at the next stage, the government will want to introduce social distancing measures for people who are vulnerable or who have underlying conditions. 
  But it is too early to recommend that, he says. 
  He says this would lead to other problems, like loneliness. 
  But at some point it will be necessary to do this, he says. 
  
 
 
  5.15pm GMT  
  
  And Whitty says there will now no longer by any geographical limits to testing. 
  
 
 
  5.15pm GMT  
  
  Whitty says there are other changes too. 
  The government no longer needs to identify every case, he says. People staying at home will not need testing. Testing will focus on people in hospitals with symptoms. 
  
 
 
  5.14pm GMT  
  
  Whitty says it is important that people with mild symptoms do not call 111. 
  But if their conditions deteriorate, they should seek medical help. 
  
 
 
  5.13pm GMT  
  
  Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, is speaking now. 
  He says the contain phase is over, and the government is moving on to the delay phase. 
  All four chief medical officers have agreed to raise the risk level to high. 
  He says it is important not to ask people too early to respond. There is a danger of fatigue. 
  Washing hands is very important, he says. 
  He says, from today, the government is asking people who have a persistent cough which is new, or a temperature, to stay at home for seven days. 
  It is important to explain why, he says. 
  First, he says this reduces the risk to older people and people with underlying conditions. 
  Second, he says this can reduce the peak. 
  And, third, this can delay the peak, he says. 
  He says they have chosen seven days because the illness is most infectious at the beginning. 
  He says the evidence suggests that people with mild symptoms can spread the disease to a lot of people. 
  
 
 
  5.09pm GMT  
  
  Vallance says the timing is critical: if you tell people to stay at home too early, they get fed up with this at the point where you need them to stay at home. 
  On closing schools, he says for this to be effective, closures would have to last from 13 to 16 weeks. He says children would, in practice, keep mixing with each other during that period. And they might get sent to stay with grandparents, which could increase the risk, he says. 
  
 
 
  5.08pm GMT  
  
  Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, is speaking now. 
  This is a new disease, he says. He says no one has immunity to it. 
  He says it looks as if the UK is on a trajectory about four weeks behind Italy. 
  He shows a slide showing a peak. This shows the pattern of an infection, he says. 
  He says it starts with very low numbers. He says the number of infections at the moment is likely to be between 5,000 and 10,000. 
  Then the number of infections rise steeply, he says. 
  He says the government wants to do two things: to delay the peak, and to push the peak down. 
  He says delaying the peak pushes it into the summer, when respiratory diseases are less common. 
  He says it is not possible to stop everyone getting it. And it is not desirable either, he says. He says you want people to pick up immunity. 
  He says the disease seems to come in two phases: an early, mildish phase, and then a second phase, where the elderly and people with underlying conditions are vulnerable. 
  
 
 
  5.04pm GMT  
  
  Johnson says he wants to address older people in particular. For most people this is a mild illness, but he knows they are vulnerable. 
  He says he wants to tell them that the government will do all it can “to help you and your family”. 
  The government is not just helping the economy, he says. He says he wants to stress that it is helping families. 
  He says he wants to end with two familiar messages. 
  First, it is vital to wash your hands. 
  And, second, the country will get through this, just as it has got through other situations like this. 
  
 
 
  5.02pm GMT  
  
  Johnson says this will cause disruption across the country for many months. 
  He says he wants to urge people not to call 111, but to use the internet to get information if they can. 
  
 
 
  5.01pm GMT  
  
  Johnson says he is not closing schools now. 
  He says the advice is that his could do more harm than good. 
  But the situation may change, he says. 
  
 
 
  5.00pm GMT  
  
  Johnson says the government is considering banning large events. 
  He says that won’t necessarily reduce the spread. But that would ease the pressure on the emergency services, he says. 
  
 
 
  5.00pm GMT  
  
  Johnson says tomorrow, if you have coronavirus symptoms, you should stay home for at least seven days. 
  He says people over 70 with underlying medical conditions are being advised to avoid going on cruises.  
  And he says schools are being advised to cancel overseas trips. 
  
 
 
  4.58pm GMT  
 Boris Johnson says 'many more' people will die from coronavirus 
  
  Boris Johnson is starting his press conference. 
  He says he has just chaired a Cobra meeting. They have done what they can to contain coronavirus, he says. 
  The true number of cases is higher, “perhaps much higher”, than the figures suggest, he says. 
  He says this is the worst public health crisis for a general. It is much more serious than flu, he says. He goes on: 
   
   More families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time.

 Labour scales back size of event planned for announcement of new leader because of coronavirus 
  
  Jeremy Corbyn’s successor as Labour leader will now be announced at a scaled-back event as the party postpones and alters meetings due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Press Association reports. The PA story goes on: 
   
   Labour said that the final leadership hustings of the race was being cancelled, while the party’s Welsh conference and Scottish women’s conference were being postponed. 
   The party said the “wellbeing of our members and staff” and contributing to the “collective effort to protect public health” were behind the decision. 
   The winner of the race between Sir Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy will still be announced on 4 April as planned, but it will no longer be at a “special conference”. 
   Labour’s decision was announced shortly after the UK moved on to the next stage of its response to Covid-19, with potential restrictions being imposed to delay the spread of the disease. 
   A Labour spokeswoman said: “In light of the spread of coronavirus, Labour has cancelled the leadership elections special conference scheduled for 4 April. 
   “The results of the leadership and deputy leadership elections will be announced at a scaled-back event on the same date and we are now considering options for what form that event will take. 
   “This is not a decision we have taken lightly. Our priority is the wellbeing of our members and staff, and ensuring we fully contribute to the collective effort to protect public health.” 
   The final hustings was due to take place in Tottenham, north London, on Saturday and focus on black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) issues. 
   Party officials were also considering whether constituency meetings should go ahead.

  Earlier I quoted the Institute for Fiscal Studies saying yesterday’s budget was less generous on current spending than it appeared. (See 1.56pm.) These two charts from the detailed presentation on public services (pdf) explain why in more detail. 
  This chart shows how, in real terms, day-to-day spending on public services will be higher in 2024-25 than it was in 2009-10, at the end of the last Labour government. But there’s a catch, or rather two. First, if you look at day-to-day spending on public services per head, it is no higher than it was in 2009-10 (because the population has got bigger). And, second, if you take out health, which received a sizeable, long-term spending increase under Theresa May, real-terms spending on everything else is lower than at the end of the Labour government, both overall (7% lower) and per person (14% lower). 
   
    
    
    Real-terms public spending figures.

  But the IFS also says these figures are potentially misleading, for two reasons. First, they include the £11bn a year that the UK will save because it won’t have to make annual payments to the EU - but they do not take into account the £7-8bn a year that the EU used to spend in the UK. And, second, they include an extra £5.5bn a year that the government is spending because of changes to the rules on employer pension contributions. The IFS argues that taking out these figures allows for a more reliable comparison with the past, and on that basis it has produced a chart with adjusted figures (see below). 
  On this measure, day-to-day public spending in real terms will still be higher in 2024-25 than in 2009-10, but only 5% higher, not 9% higher. But day-to-day spending per person ends up being 4% lower in 2024-25 in real terms than in 2009-10, overall spending excluding health is 12% lower, and spending per person excluding health is 19% lower.

  Sturgeon is now taking questions. 
  Q: What sort of gatherings do you want to cancel? 
  Ones that put pressure on emergency services, she says. So that would not mean church events. But it would mean sports events. 
  She says, as the weeks go on, the emergency services are going to come under growing pressure. That is why she wants to ease the pressure on them. 
  She says she will publish further details in due course.

 People with a fever or a persistent cough should stay at home for seven days, says Sturgeon 
  
  Sturgeon says moving from “contain” to “delay” means that anyone with coronavirus-type symptoms will be advised to stay at home for seven days. 
  That means people who have a fever, or a persistent cough, she says. 
  She says those people do not have to see a doctor, unless their condition gets worse. 
  She says the UK government is not advising schools to close at the moment. But it is advising schools to cancel overseas trips. 
  And she says it is important for people to understand that, if schools were to close, it would not just be for a week or two. It would be until the disease had passed its peak, which would mean until the summer, she says. 
  She also restates her position on mass gatherings. She says this is just a Scottish government position, not a UK government position. She repeats the point she made to the Scottish parliament earlier (see 12.57pm), when she said she wanted to cancel mass gatherings primarily to ease the pressures on the emergency services.

  The Scottish Green party has cancelled its spring conference, which was due to take place on Saturday 28 March, because of the coronavirus outbreak after the number of cases declared in Scotland jumped to 60 on Thursday. 
  Ross Greer MSP, a co-chair of the party’s executive, said:  
   
   Due to the ongoing coronavirus situation the Scottish Greens executive committee has today taken the decision to cancel our upcoming conference. The health and wellbeing of our members and the public is our primary concern and it is with that in mind that we have taken this decision. 
   
  The conference was due to be held at the Adam Smith theatre in Kirkcaldy, the birth place of the legendary 18th century economist.

  Johnny Mercer, the veterans minister, promised to unveil a bill on Wednesday next week to introduce a statutory presumption against prosecution for veterans in the Commons, as he made a statement about mental health in the armed forces in the morning.  
  The minister said he was meeting a pledges to legislate in this area, but would not say how or whether the measures would apply to Northern Ireland, where many violent incidents from the time of the Troubles are only now beginning to be investigated by legal authorities.  
  “The days of lawyers running amok in our services and in our veterans community, trying to rewrite history, in order to make money, are over,” Mercer added. 
  The party’s election manifesto promised to “introduce new legislation to tackle the vexatious legal claims that undermine our armed forces”. 
  In the last parliament Penny Mordaunt, the then defence secretary, proposed a statutory presumption against prosecutions against veterans for incidents taking place 10 or more years ago, covering Iraq, Afghanistan and any other armed conflict overseas - but left open the question of Northern Ireland, prompting pressure from Conservative backbenchers for it to be included. 
  Mercer was challenged by newly elected Alliance party MP Stephen Farry, who voiced concern about the impending legislation. He said: 
   
   I do challenge this narrative of excessive claims being made against veterans, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland. It undermines the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland, which has the ability to weed out such claims. 
   
  Farry warned that some veterans could get “unnecessary protection, warping the rule of law” in relation to historic claims as a result. 
  In reply Mercer said that when to comes to Northern Ireland “I tread down this path with utmost care”.

  The Scottish government is to get an £350m as its share of the extra money that Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, released in yesterday’s budget to boost public spending to cope with the coronavirus crisis. 
  A UK government source said Wales would receive £220m extra and Northern Ireland £120m. 
  The money has not been ringfenced, allowing all three devolved administrations to spend it as they see fit, but they will face significant political and public pressure to focus on tackling the pandemic’s impacts on the NHS, public services and businesses. 
  The Scottish health secretary, Jeane Freeman, was challenged on BBC Radio Scotland about the availability of protective equipment such as face masks when doctors across Scotland texted the BBC to say they had not been issued with any or had run out. 
  Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, told Holyrood today that the NHS would be put under great strain. “Our emergency services are likely to suffer from higher than normal sickness absence rates in the weeks and months ahead and our NHS in particular will be under significant pressure,” she said. 
  Kate Forbes, Scotland’s finance secretary, said yesterday her government had not yet been told how much extra money it would get but was pleased the Treasury was increasing funding.

 Budget plans for current spending 'nothing like as generous as they appear', says IFS 
  
  The Institute for Fiscal Studies is holding its traditional day-after briefing on the budget. It started with an overview from Paul Johnson, its director, and the full text is now available on the IFS website. 
   
   Johnson said the economy was not in a robust state for dealing with a shock like coronavirus. And failure to negotiate a trade deal with the EU this year could make that worse, he said. He explained: 
   
   
   The OBR’s economic forecasts are a little more positive than the Bank’s, but they are still very weak even before factoring in possible longer term effects from the coronavirus. Projected growth rates averaging barely over one and a half per cent a year for the next five years are feeble and indicative of an economy that is not in a robust position for coping with shocks like the coronavirus. The OBR continues to assume an orderly move to a free trade agreement with the EU. Anything less orderly, or a failure to achieve such an agreement, would weaken an already weak economy even further. 
   
   
   He said that if coronavirus had a long-term impact on the economy, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, would have to revise his strategy. Johnson said: 
   
   
   Only time will tell whether any of the numbers in this budget will have meaning once the economic effects of coronavirus become fully evident ... 
   If the long-term path of the economy is affected then [Sunak] will also need to reassess much more of his fiscal strategy when he returns to the despatch box in the autumn. 
   
   
   He said the plans for current spending were “nothing like as generous as they appear”. He explained: 
   
   
   Average annual increases of 2.8% sound substantial. Take account of the need to replace EU funding, and factor in planned increases for health, schools, defence and overseas aid, and there is relatively little here for other departments. If this spending envelope is stuck to there are plenty of public services which will not be enjoying much in the way of spending increases over the next few years. 
   
   
   He said overall spending is due to rise by 9% in real terms between 2019-20 and 2023-24, “largely paid for by extra borrowing”. He said public spending would stabilise at around 41% of national income, “above its pre-crisis level and bigger than at any point between the mid 1980s and the start of the financial crisis”. 
   
   
   But he said current spending per head for most public services would remain well below 2010-11 levels in 2024-25. He went on: 
   
   
   While austerity is clearly at an end in the sense that spending is rising, spending levels in many areas are set to remain well below 2010 levels for a long time to come. Expectations may be disappointed. 
   
   
   He said although public spending was rising, it was not rising by as much as Labour proposed in its 2019 manifesto.  
   
   
   He said he thought the £12bn package of measures to help the country tackle coronavirus was “fairly well designed”.

  Here are two of the most striking charts from the Resolution Foundation’s report (pdf) on yesterday’s budget. 
   
   The UK’s medium-term outlook for growth is “dismal”, the foundation says. It explains: 
   
   
   The [Office for Budget Responsibility’s] medium-term outlook is dismal. [The chart below] shows cumulative real GDP growth over the five-year forecast period for each fiscal event since the OBR’s inception. As it makes plain, the OBR’s outlook in March 2020 is the second-weakest in its history, pipped only by its March 2018 prognosis. If yesterday’s forecast holds true, we estimate that the economy will have underperformed by almost one-quarter relative to the average five-year growth rate of the preceding decade. And the growth rates for the fourth and fifth years of the forecast are both the weakest on record.

   The overall impact of tax and benefit changes since 2015 has been highly regressive, the foundation says. It explains: 
   
   
   [The chart below] shows the overall impact of benefit and tax policy choices on households across the income distribution since summer budget 2015. Given that welfare support is targeted at lower-income households, and that the 2015 package of welfare cuts was so substantial (including the benefits freeze and two-child limit), the average losses for poorer households are very large. For example, the second decile will ultimately be £2,900 a year worse off (on average) than if welfare policy had remained unchanged, with £900 of that still to come as a result of welfare policies still being rolled out.  
   Welfare cuts have been somewhat offset (in aggregate) by tax cuts. Successive cuts to income tax, through increases in the personal allowance and higher-rate threshold, have been followed in this budget by an increase in the starting point for national insurance, as well as repeated fuel duty freezes. But these changes have been of most benefit – in cash terms – to the top half of the income distribution, though this has been tempered at the very top by tax increases targeted at the richest tenth of the population.

  President Trump did not contact Boris Johnson directly before his decision to ban citizens from 26 EU countries from entering the US for the next 30 days, No 10 has said. Britain and Ireland are exempt from the ruling because they are not in the Schengen border-free travel agreement. 
  No 10 said today the government had no plans for the UK to follow the US and ban travel from EU countries. The prime minister’s spokesman said: 
   
   We have been following the advice of the chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser in relation to all parts of our response to this virus and the advice we’ve been given is that is not a step they recommend in the UK. 
   
  Asked about concerns that other countries were taking a different approach to the virus, such as Ireland and Denmark, where they have already moved to school closures, the spokesman said: “We believe that we are taking our decisions based on the best scientific and medical advice that is available.”

 Sturgeon says she is minded to cancel events involving crowds of more than 500 in Scotland 
  
  This is what Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs in the Scottish parliament about her plan to cancel mass gatherings in Scotland. She said that she would be participating in the Cobra meeting chaired by the prime minister this afternoon to discuss coronavirus, and she said she expected the UK to move from the “contain” phase of the strategy to the “delay” phase. She went on: 
   
   In addition, the health secretary [Jeane Freeman] and I have been considering what further actions we require to take, particularly to protect the resilience of our frontline emergency workers, and that does involve our position on mass gatherings ... 
   The scientific advice is telling us that cancelling mass gatherings will not, in itself, have a significant impact on reducing the spread of the virus. Of course that does not mean it will have no impact on that. 
   But the view that the health secretary and I have come to is that there are wider issues to take account of here. Mass gatherings require to be policed. They require to have emergency ambulance cover. They require the services of our voluntary health services. And at a time when we need to be reducing the pressures on these frontline workers in order to free them up to focus on the significant challenge that lies ahead, I do think it is inappropriate that we continue as normal. 
   So the health secretary and I this morning have decided that we are minded – and this is something that we will seek views on from others at Cobra – now that we will advise the cancellation, from the start of next week, of mass gatherings of 500 people or more. And that is principally to protect the resilience of our frontline workers.

 Jenrick announces changes to planning laws to encourage more house building 
  
  Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, has just delivered a statement to MPs about planning. It is normal for a budget to be followed by ministerial announcements in the following days fleshing out some of the proposals announced by the chancellor, and yesterday Rishi Sunak said that Jenrick would be setting out “comprehensive reforms to bring the planning system into the 21st century”. Sunak may have jumped the gun, because although Jenrick said there would be a planning white paper, he told the Commons that it would not be published until the spring. 
  Despite not being ready to publish a full package of measures, Jenrick was able to outline a series of proposals that are in the pipeline. He said that his priority was ensuring more homes get built, so that it was easier for young people to acquire a home. In particular, he announced: 
   
   A drive to encourage building on brownfield sites. Some £400m is being spent regenerating brownfield sites, and a map of development opportunities on brownfield sites will be produced.  
   
   
   A move to “dramatically accelerate” the planning system. This will involve making it more digital, with planning fees linked to performance. 
   
   
   Developers will get new rights to demolish shops or industrial units to build homes. 
   
   
   More information will be published about who owns options for land development. 
   
   
   The formula used by councils to assess local housing need will be revised, with a view to ensuring that more homes are built, particularly in urban areas. 
   
   
   Councils will be told that all local plans must be completed by December 2023 
   
   
   Two bills will be introduced: a building safety bill, and a renters reform bill. 
   
   
   The national planning policy framework will be revised, to embed the principle of good design in it. 
   
   
   Planning rules for areas at high risk of flooding will be reviewed.

 Voting in division lobbies does not pose coronavirus risk to MPs, says Rees-Mogg 
  
  Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has told MPs that they are not at high risk of catching coronavirus when they congregate in the division lobbies to vote. He was speaking during business questions, and responding to a question from the SNP MP Tommy Sheppard who said that it might be safer for MPs during the coronavirus outbreak to abandon their normal method of voting (queuing up in a smallish lobby while waiting to have their names ticketed off by a clerk) and to instead use the deferred division procedure (voting using a ballot paper). Rees-Mogg replied that he had taken a Public Health England official into a division lobby and been told that the lobbies were “not a high risk”. But the expert did suggest opening windows, Rees-Mogg said. 
  Rees-Mogg also indicated that emergency legislation to give the government new powers to deal with the outbreak would be introduced in the week beginning Monday 23 March.

  Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has said that there is a “big question mark” about whether large public events like football matches should continue to go ahead during the coronavirus outbreak. In an interview with ITV’s Good Morning Britain she said that, even if events like these did not significantly contribute to the spread, they distracted the emergency services. She explained: 
   
   Mass gatherings, football matches for example, they need to be policed, they need to have emergency medical ambulance cover. 
   We are going into a period where our emergency services, our NHS in particular, will be under significant challenge and significant pressure, we may see all of our workforces affected by high absentee rates because of sickness, so there’s a wider issue here about whether cancelling those kind of events is the right thing to do to reduce pressure on our front-line emergency workers. 
   From a wider resilience point of view, then I think there is a big question mark over whether large-scale events like that, whether it is sensible to allow them to proceed at the moment. 
   We’re looking very carefully right now at whether large-scale events, whether it would be right and sensible given the situation we are facing right now to allow them to go ahead. 
   
  The UK government may announce a move towards new “social distancing measures” after a Cobra emergency committee meeting on coronavirus being chaired by Boris Johnson this afternoon. Sturgeon said she thought it was time to move from the “contain” phase of the strategy to the “delay” phase.

 No 10 set to announce feasibility study into bridge linking Scotland to Northern Ireland, says minister

In an interview this morning, asked why there was no money for the plan in the budget, he replied: “Watch this space.” He went on: 
   
   The prime minister I expect will announce a feasibility study into the link to Northern Ireland. I hope the Scottish government will back it. 
   
  Johnson has a fondness for extravagant infrastructure schemes and he has repeatedly expressed interest in a bridge linking Scotland and Northern Ireland, despite experts dismissing the idea as impractical. Jack has suggested that the scheme could involve a combination of tunnel and bridge.

 Rishi Sunak's morning interviews – summary 
  
  Here are the main points from Rishi Sunak’s morning interview round. 
   
   Sunak, the chancellor, criticised President Trump’s flight ban announcement, saying that the UK government’s view was that measures like this would not have much impact on the spread of coronavirus. (See 8.55am.) 
   
   
   He accepted that the flight ban would have an impact on the UK economy. Asked on the Today programme whether it would have a negative impact on the economy, he accepted that it would, although in his answer he focused on making a general point about the negative economic impact of coronavirus. He said: 
   
   
   The US is still deciding the details of what exactly that means, but you are right. As I talked about yesterday, there will be an impact on the demand side of our economy as people are unable to spend in the way they normally would and travel, but it also affects the supply chains for businesses and that impacts the supply side of our economy. 
   As those supply chains are disrupted, the productive capacity of our economy will shrink for a period of time. 
   
   
   He dismissed claims that his spending plans were irresponsible. He said:  
   
   
   I make absolutely no apology for responding in the short term in scale to the immediate threat that we face from coronavirus. 
   I think that’s the right thing to do for the economy. We need to help businesses have a bridge to get to the other side. 
   In the medium term, as you will see from the figures, there is actually responsible economic management and it’s because we’ve had responsible economic management for several years that I’m able to stand here in a strong position to say that we will do whatever it takes to get through this. 
   
   
   He said that his measures were compatible with the fiscal rules set out in the Conservative manifesto. 
   
   
   He laughed off suggestions that he had delivered a Gordon Brown budget, or a Labour budget. When LBC’s Nick Ferrari put this to him, Sunak laughed, and said he would let others make that judgment. 
   
   
   He suggested that Jeremy Corbyn’s resignation as Labour leader was holding up the announcement of plans for reform of social care. When asked about the absence of social care from the budget, he said that Matt Hancock, the health secretary, wrote to MPs last week proposing cross-party talks starting in May. When it was put to him that the government was taking a long time, particularly since Boris Johnson claimed to have a plan for social care last summer, Sunak replied: 
   
   
   There is no permanent leader of the opposition at the moment. They’re having a leadership contest, so we can’ formally start that process until they have one. 
   
   
   Sunak defended his decision not to extend sick pay to cover the low-paid and the self-employed. In the budget he said that people in these categories would instead find it easier to claim benefits as a result of rules being relaxed during the coronavirus outbreak. This morning he said: 
   
   
   For those that don’t [have access to statutory sick pay] we’ve strengthened the working of our welfare system so that it works quicker, more responsibly and more generously for those people. 
   
  He also claimed that around half of workers who needed to take time off would get more than statutory sick pay because their employers offered more generous arrangements. 
   
   He sidestepped a question about whether he and his family would be able to live on £90 a week. Statutory sick pay is worth £94.25 per week. Asked whether that was enough to live on, he replied: 
   
   
   We have strengthened our safety net to make sure we have access to benefits easier, quicker, more generously, and also provided an extra £500m to local authorities to distribute to vulnerable people and their local communities if they need extra support.  
   
  When pressed on whether he could live on this himself, he said: 
   
   This is a safety net. That is what it’s there for, to provide people to fall back on. It’s obviously not the same as your day-to-day life 
   
   
   He defended his decision not to include nurseries in the list of companies that will qualify for a one-year exemption from business rates. The nursery sector has been horrified by the decision. Asked why they were not included, Sunak said: 
   
   
   Because what we’ve done on business rates is target the sectors of the economy which are in the consumption side of the economy, which will see a very significant hit because of people’s inability to spend. And what we wanted to do is make sure that they don’t go out of business during that period of time. 
   
   
   He accepted that his plans involved making an assumption about the cost of borrowing remaining low, but it was a judgment he defended. He said: 
   
   
   You have to make a judgment about the persistence of low interest rates, that’s a judgment I have to make as chancellor. 
   The reality is these interest rates have stayed lower for longer than anyone expected and keep falling, and it’s right that I as someone in charge of managing our public finances has a view on that.

 Trump's travel ban won't have much impact on spread of coronavirus, says Rishi Sunak 
  
  Good morning. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has been doing the tradition post-budget morning interview round and, in a sign perhaps of the seriousness of the crisis facing the economy, No 10 has lifted its usual ban and let him speak to the Today programme. 
  The first topic to come up, of course, was President Trump’s shock decision last night to announce a 30-day ban on people from most EU countries (but not the UK) from travelling to the US. 
  Criticising American presidents in public does not come easily to UK government ministers, particularly Conservative ones working for Boris Johnson, but Sunak could not avoid saying he thought Trump’s plan was a bad idea. He told the Today programme: 
   
   With regard to flight bans, we are always guided by the science as we make our decisions here. The advice we are getting is that there isn’t evidence that interventions like closing borders or travel bans are going to have a material effect on the spread of the infection. That is why we have taken the decisions we have.  
   
  In another BBC interview he was more direct. “We haven’t believed that that’s the right thing to do, the evidence here doesn’t support that,” he said. 
  I will post more from his interviews shortly. 
  Here is the agenda for the day. 
  10am: Lord Hall, the BBC director general, and Sir David Clementi, its chairman, give evidence to the Commons culture committee. 
  1pm: The Institute for Fiscal Studies holds a briefing on the budget. 
  1.15pm: Boris Johnson chairs a meeting of Cobra, the government’s emergency committee, to discuss coronavirus. 
  We’re also due to get an announcement from Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, on plans to reform planning laws. 
  I will be covering Westminster coronavirus developments, but our main coronavirus coverage is on a separate coronavirus outbreak live blog.  As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up.

  I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. 
  If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.

199,health,Coroner writes to health secretary over mental health care,"A coroner has highlighted concerns over the care given to a young woman with severe obsessive compulsive disorder who killed herself while on leave from a mental health hospital. An inquest jury in Winchester concluded that Sasha Forster, a 20-year-old student, killed herself by ingesting medication that she knew was highly toxic when taken in large amounts. The coroner, David Reid, said he would write to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, over how Forster was able to obtain medication from a private GPs’ practice in London when her own NHS doctors had stopped prescribing it amid fears she would harm herself.   Related: Sasha Forster: a 'lovely, clever' woman let down by a litany of failures    Reid said he would also write to Hancock about evidence that the hospital treating Forster after she was sectioned following an earlier apparent suicide attempt did not have enough staff to bring her back to hospital when she absconded. Sasha’s family believe that the young woman was badly let down. In a statement released through the charity INQUEST they said: “Sasha had so much to live for and she tried so desperately hard to get well. We feel that this inquest has shown the flaws and inconsistencies in the system that let her down. “On the day of Sasha’s death there was no clear crisis plan in place for staff to follow, and a psychiatric team refused to see Sasha.” They added: “Sasha was often dismissed by some staff as they labelled her as attention seeking. We hope that by shining a light on these issues, actions will be taken to prevent other young adults and their families having the same experience.” During a four-week inquest described as “harrowing” by the coroner, the jury heard how Forster’s OCD became so intense that she had to complete hours of rituals before she could even get out of bed. She believed there was evil inside her and if she did not carry out the rituals, harm would come to herself and her family. The jury was told that after doctors had stopped prescribing a certain medication because they were worried she would misuse it, she twice visited a private GP service miles away from her home. Two doctors gave her a total of six weeks’ worth of the medication though they had no access to her notes. It has not been possible to establish if the medication she was prescribed by the private GPs was the actual one she used to kill herself. On 10 January 2017 Sasha almost died following an overdose. She was detained under the Mental Health Act and became a patient at Farnham Road hospital in Guildford, Surrey, a specialist mental health facility run by Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS foundation trust. Staff struggled to cope with her and she was allowed home on temporary leave. She began to split her time between home and the hospital. But her family say the overdose damaged her short-term memory. She could remember the concept of her rituals – but not the complicated repetitive actions she felt she had to do to keep her family safe. On 31 March 2017 she suffered a serious crisis at home. Her mother, Angela, told the inquest that she tried to take her to see a psychiatric liaison team run by the Surrey and Borders trust at a hospital in Frimley, Surrey, but was turned away because there was confusion over her care plan. She ran away and was found by police but they had no power to confiscate the medication she had on her. The inquest was told shortages meant the Farnham Road hospital did not have enough staff to allow one of them to leave the site and fetch her. Police let her go and she was found dead later that day next to a pond. Catherine Shannon, of Bhatt Murphy Solicitors and Sophy Miles, of Doughty Street Chambers, who acted for the family, said: “Sasha was detained under section 3 of the Mental Health Act at the time of her death; she was at high risk and vulnerable. This inquest has raised important questions about the ability of mental health providers to plan crisis care for those on leave from hospitals and to recall and return them safely when this becomes necessary.” Deborah Coles, director of INQUEST, said: “Deeply concerning evidence was heard during this inquest, which pointed towards gaps and missed opportunities in the way various agencies responded to Sasha’s mental health crises.” Dr Justin Wilson, chief medical officer at Surrey and Borders partnership NHS foundation trust, said after the conclusion that there were inconsistencies in the care provided to Forster. Wilson said the trust had already made “several key developments” in areas such as improving partnerships with emergency services colleagues and managing leave.
