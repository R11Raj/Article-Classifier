0,cancer,How to check yourself for breast cancer,"There is no evidence to suggest that a particular technique works best, but checking your breasts regularly is vital; the sooner breast cancer is diagnosed, the more effective treatment may be. All breasts are different, so women are encouraged to get to know their own breasts over time. Follow this simple advice: touch, look and check (TLC). Some breasts have natural bumps or nodular breast tissue, and women often have one breast larger than the other. Changes can also occur to the breasts during women’s cycles. There is no special training needed and no rule as to how often you should check. You could be in the shower or bath, or moisturising your body or in bed – whenever you are relaxed. It is important to check all over the breast tissue, including the nipple area, up to the armpits and up to the collarbone. Looking is useful, too. Is the nipple red? Is there discharge? Most nipple discharge is not caused by breast cancer, but you should tell your GP if it is new for you. If a lump is large, sometimes you can see it. Stand in front of the mirror with your hands on your hips and see if anything is distorting the breast. If there is a lump inside the breast, it can pull on the breast and cause an orange-peel appearance. Most lumps, bumps and changes will not be breast cancer, but tell your GP if you find something that is unusual for you. It might be benign but need treatment and some women are prone to cysts.

1,cancer,Cancer charities say coronavirus shortfall will set back research,"The UK’s best-known cancer charity has become the latest victim of the multibillion pound fundraising crisis sweeping the voluntary sector as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, warning that a shortfall of donations will set back progress on fighting the disease. Cancer Research UK announced it is to drastically scale back its research plans after the cancellation of a range of fundraising events and the closure of charity shops meant it will lose up to a quarter of its donated income over the next 12 months – about £120m. Meanwhile, Macmillan Cancer Support, the UK’s second biggest cancer charity, said the wipeout in fundraising events meant it now expected to lose up to half its fundraising income this year – about £100m – due to the wipeout of established fundraising events at a time when pressure on its services was growing. The massive financial hit taken by two of the UK’s biggest and best-supported charities is likely to put further pressure on ministers to launch a financial rescue package for charities which provide frontline health, social and care services but which are currently unable to undertake crucial fundraising activities. The collapse of “social fundraising” events followed the introduction of physical distancing measures in the UK last month, and included the postponement of big fundraising events such as the London Marathon, the closure of thousands of charity shops, and the cancellation of smaller “social fundraising” events from bring-and-buys to coffee mornings. Cancer Research UK admitted that the blow to its finances and research capacity could set back its fight against the disease for many years – and directly impact on its goal to see three in four people survive their cancer by 2034. Some of its clinical and scientific staff and researchers have transferred to Covid-19 work in the NHS. “There can be no doubt that this global pandemic is going to cause huge strain on charities in the coming months,” said Michelle Mitchell, Cancer Research UK’s chief executive. “People affected by cancer will be facing difficult situations because they are particularly vulnerable, or because their treatment is being affected by the knock-on impact in the health service, and our priority is making sure we can support them during these unprecedented times.” Cancer Research UK’s admission that it is going to have to rein in its research programme – alongside cutbacks across the entire charity, including a 20% pay cut for senior staff – is the latest in a series of blows for the voluntary sector that is reeling from an estimated £4bn loss in income over the next few weeks, which is normally its peak fundraising period. Claire Rowneyof Macmillan Cancer Support said: “The Covid-19 pandemic is already having a devastating impact on charities, ourselves included. “It is too early to report exact figures, but we are monitoring the situation daily and expect our income to drop significantly in line with estimates by the sector which anticipate charities will lose between 35% and 50% of their annual income due to the impact of coronavirus on some fundraising events which are being cancelled or postponed. “As the NHS comes under enormous strain, people living with cancer will need Macmillan now more than ever and the pressure on our frontline services has never been greater, with about a third of all calls to our support line in the last week from cancer patients concerned about Covid-19. We expect this figure to continue to rise in the coming weeks and months.” On Tuesday night Teenage Cancer Trust said it was set to lose about half of its income this year – £11m – after most of its upcoming fundraising activities and events were cancelled or postponed, including a sold-out week of music and comedy at the Royal Albert Hall that was set to raise £1m. Kate Collins, chief executive of Teenage Cancer Trust called on ministers to provide financial support to keep charity-funded services afloat at a time when young people with cancer were suffering isolation and uncertainty. “The sector is facing a huge increase in need at a time of significant loss in income,” she said.   Related: There could soon be a test to detect cancer years in advance. Would you take it? | Saskia Sanderson    Karl Wilding, chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said: “This is a very stark example of what the loss of fundraising income means for the work that charities do. Without government support, we’re going to see more and more charities cutting back their work or closing entirely.” Ministers have been under pressure to extend financial help to the charity sector on similar grounds to the support they have offered to small- and medium-sized businesses but, despite three weeks of negotiations, no help has been forthcoming, save suggestions that a £100m bailout fund is being prepared, a figure charity insiders have derided as “inadequate”. Charities which have reported financial problems as a result of the fundraising collapse include Sue Ryder hospices, and the St John Ambulance, which told MPs it would run out of money in the next four months because of the collapse of its training business. St John has deployed hundreds of volunteers around the NHS to help tackle Covid-19."
2,cancer,Coronavirus crisis is 'stopping vital cancer care' in England,"Cancer treatment has become a postcode lottery with many patients not receiving vital care as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, doctors have warned. 
Leading oncologists have said that even those patients in category one and two priority, the highest for continuing treatment, are not receiving chemotherapy. 
The NHS said non-urgent operations would have to be put on hold so hospitals could focus on battling the Covid-19 pandemic, and NHS England guidance states that cancer services should continue to deliver care. However, it also calls for “local solutions to continue the proper management of these cancer services while protecting resources for the response to coronavirus”. 
Prof Karol Sikora, the chief medical officer at Rutherford Health, which runs oncology centres, said the advice provided by NHS England around cancer was sensible but was being “implemented inconsistently” around the country. 
 
  Related: Coronavirus means difficult, life-changing decisions for me and my cancer patients  
 
“That is always the trouble – it becomes inconsistent, so people getting chemotherapy have now had it stopped even though they are category one and two patients, the highest priority. Also some hospitals have put blanket bans on cancer treatment for two to three weeks ... Not everyone needs to rush ahead with cancer treatment but others need to continue despite this to get the best long-term cure,” he said. 
Sikora said: “The important thing here is people with curable cancer still get treatment. The private sector is in talks with NHS England and providers to provide increased capacity for NHS patients.”The doctor said one of his close friends who worked in gastroenterology had got an email from a nurse saying “not to bother coming in” and that his treatment would be “stopped for the duration of the crisis”. “The emotion is very difficult for our patients ... everything is uncertain,” he said. 
“It is a hard decision regarding how much you transfer care to coronavirus and how much say ‘we have to keep going with vital non-urgent but critical services’. The same is true of cardiac care.” 
He said that there was the “looming threat” that cancer centres would close and all staff would go to the new Nightingale hospitals, built to take coronavirus patients from overstretched NHS facilities. “I don’t think that will happen. But there is concern that they will abandon all cancer patients. It would be sad if that happened.” 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
Angus George Dalgleish, a professor of oncology at St George’s, University of London, said: “It’s difficult. Coronavirus is having a devastating impact on how we deliver ordinary care – everything is out on hold or delayed.” 
Asked whether this could mean more indirect deaths because of patients not getting care, Dalgleish said that “we won’t know until it is all over”. 
“But we are already seeing the effects of patients who are not going to get treatment. I heard today St George’s is going to have nine wards full of coronavirus patients. They cannot do that without seriously impacting care of everyone else.” 
Laura Lee, the chief executive of the cancer charity Maggie’s, said anxieties among patients were being exacerbated by the current situation. She said: “The government needs to be more articulate about the issue, in the same way it has explored the effects of Covid on, for example, businesses and employment. In a sense, the plight of Covid isn’t just with those who are going through Covid.”

She said that people had heard about the plight of those losing their jobs, but not about those with health conditions who would be affected by the virus, adding: “The unintended consequences or the non-choice consequences are coming.” 
Dr Rosie Loftus, the joint chief medical officer at Macmillan Cancer Support, said that more than a quarter of calls to the charity’s support line in the past week were from cancer patients concerned about Covid-19. “We’re hearing from people who are feeling upset and scared, fretful about their future and even lonelier as a result of having to self-isolate,” she said. 
“We recognise that these are exceptional circumstances for the NHS. It is vital that, across the UK, the NHS is assessing the impact of coronavirus on cancer treatment and care, and putting in place urgent plans to ensure that vital cancer services can still be delivered safely. Even in a time of crisis, decisions for cancer patients must be made according to an individual assessment of their need for critical care and treatment and their vulnerability to coronavirus.”

NHS England said in a letter issued to hospitals: “Essential and urgent cancer treatments must continue. Cancer specialists should discuss with their patients whether it is riskier for them to undergo or to delay treatment at this time.” It said that it had secured the use of almost all independent hospitals across England and their capacity should be used for cancer diagnosis and treatment."
3,cancer,New blood test can detect 50 types of cancer,"A new blood test that can detect more than 50 types of cancer has been revealed by researchers in the latest study to offer hope for early detection. The test is based on DNA that is shed by tumours and found circulating in the blood. More specifically, it focuses on chemical changes to this DNA, known as methylation patterns. Researchers say the test can not only tell whether someone has cancer, but can also shed light on the type of cancer they have. Dr Geoffrey Oxnard of Boston’s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, part of Harvard Medical School, said the test was now being explored in clinical trials. “You need to use a test like this in an independent group at risk of cancer to actually show that you can find the cancers, and figure out what to do about it when you find them,” he said. Writing in the journal Annals of Oncology, the team reveal how the test was developed using a machine learning algorithm – a type of artificial intelligence. Such systems pick up on patterns within data and as a result learn to classify it. The team initially fed the system with data on methylation patterns in DNA from within blood samples taken from more than 2,800 patients, before further training it with data from 3,052 participants, 1,531 of whom had cancer and 1,521 of whom did not. Using this information, the system sorted the samples into groups based on the methylation patterns. The team then taught the system which groups reflected which type of cancer. “In pregnant women we look in their free-floating DNA for foetal abnormalities,” said Oxnard. “We know this [approach] exists, the question is how do you fine-tune and perfect the art of looking for cancer in this free-floating DNA? And that is what the machine learning did.” The team then tested the trained system on another set of samples from 1,264 individuals, about half of whom had cancer. The results reveal that less than 1% of those without cancer were wrongly identified by the system as having the disease. “It is really important you don’t tell non-cancer patients they have cancer,” said Oxnard. When it came to identifying people with cancers the team found that, across more than 50 different types of cancer, the system correctly detected that the disease was present 44% of the time – although the team stress that figure could differ if the test was used to screen a general population, rather than those known to have cancer. Detection was better the more advanced the disease was. Overall, cancer was correctly detected in 18% of those with stage I cancer, but in 93% of those with stage IV cancer. The team say the results are exciting as they offer the possibility of a new way to screen for cancers that are otherwise difficult to detect. For example, the system correctly identified 63% of those with stage I pancreatic cancer, rising to 100% in stage IV. The team further found that the system could shed light on the type of cancer. For 96% of samples deemed to show cancer, the test was able to offer a prediction for in which the tissue the cancer originated, with 93% of these predictions found to be correct. Dr David Crosby, head of early detection at Cancer Research UK, said that detecting cancers in their early stages is important as they are less aggressive and more treatable. Although this test was still at an early stage of development, the initial results were encouraging, he said. “And if the test can be fine-tuned to be more efficient at catching cancers in their earliest stages, it could become a tool for early detection.” But Crosby added there was work to do. “More research is needed to improve the test’s ability to catch early cancers and we still need to explore how it might work in a real cancer screening scenario,” he said."
4,cancer,AI program could check blood for signs of lung cancer,"Scientists have developed an artificial intelligence program that can screen people for lung cancer by analysing their blood for DNA mutations that drive the disease. The software is experimental and needs to be verified in a clinical trial, but doctors are hopeful that if it proves its worth at scale, it will boost lung cancer screening rates by making the procedure as simple as a routine blood test. The program works by examining free-floating DNA that circulates in the blood. The majority of this genetic detritus enters the bloodstream when harmless cells in the body break down and spill their molecular innards, but tumours also shed DNA as they form and grow larger. The UK has no national lung cancer screening programme, but is exploring an approach adopted in the US where people who are at high risk, such as older smokers and former smokers, can have low-dose chest X-rays to check their lungs for tumours. That system has its flaws, though, according to Max Diehn, who studies radiation oncology at Stanford University. He said only 5% of people who are eligible for lung cancer screening in the US take up the offer. Among the 95% who do not, the reasons range from a lack of access to screening in their area and simple reluctance to have the check. “A blood test option could dramatically increase the number of people who get screened, because many people are already having their blood drawn when they visit the doctors for an annual check up,” he said. Writing in the journal Nature, the scientists describe how their AI program crunched data on the DNA found in the blood of lung cancer patients to learn which common cancer mutations most effectively predicted the disease. The researchers then used the trained program to distinguish lung cancer patients from healthy people in a separate group of volunteers who gave blood samples for the study. The system cannot confidently diagnose cancer, but instead flags up likely cases for further medical investigation. In tests, the program had a 2% false positive rate – meaning that it mistakenly flagged two in every 100 healthy people as having the disease – while rating 55% of stage 2 cancers and nearly 70% of stage 3 cancers as patients likely to have the disease. “Currently we diagnose 60 to 70% of lung cancers at stage 4, when it has spread beyond the lungs,” Diehn said. “With a test like ours, while not perfect, one could potentially identify the majority of cases as early stage disease when it is still potentially curable.” The researchers found that only minuscule amounts of tumour DNA tend to circulate in the blood of lung cancer patients. A major challenge was to distinguish cancer-causing mutations in these fragments of DNA from the more common and largely harmless mutations in DNA shed from normal cells in the body. The more tumour DNA people had in their blood, the worse their future prospects, the study found, probably because more aggressive tumours shed more DNA. Dr David Crosby, head of early detection research at Cancer Research UK, said: “Too many people die from lung cancer because many are diagnosed at a late stage when the disease is harder to treat. If we can detect lung cancer earlier, we could potentially save lives. This new research, which uses machine learning, offers a promising approach that could be used to detect lung cancer earlier, but further research, on a larger scale is needed to validate the findings.”"
5,cancer,Manchester hospital to open second coronavirus-free  hub for cancer patients,"New Covid-19-free hubs for cancer patients could be a model for dealing with the large numbers of people with other conditions whose treatment stopped when lockdown began. The Christie hospital in Manchester began operating as a cancer hub last week for patients in the north-west who had previously been treated at their local hospitals. Hundreds of cancer patients across the UK had their treatment interrupted because their condition makes them vulnerable to coronavirus. Before going to the Christie, patients now have a phone call with a doctor to assess any potential Covid-19 symptoms, and on arrival are clinically assessed again. The entrance doors have temperature checks and no visitors are allowed, a spokesman said. Those with possible virus symptoms are taken to a separate area.    We’ve got trusts saying, ‘we want people to come to our A&Es' - the first time we've put that message out in 70 years.  Saffron Cordery, NHS Providers     The Christie is believed to be the first hub to come into operation since NHS leaders wrote to hospital trusts in England on 30 March, urging them to set up Covid-19-free hubs after the success of the Royal Marsden in west London, working with UCLH and Guy’s and Thomas’ hospitals. The NHS England medical director for London, Dr Vin Diwakar, said many patients had already benefited: “We’re sharing our experiences with cancer alliances across the country to help them in setting up their own cancer hubs.” It’s a model that may provide a way forward for NHS leaders trying to deal with the growing number of old and new cases. At the end of February, 4.4 million people were waiting to start treatment, and all non-urgent elective operations have been suspended for at least 12 weeks, to create spare capacity to treat Covid-19 cases. Since the lockdown began, substantial numbers of people with new injuries and illnesses have not been seeking treatment either. Less than 10,000 people per day are going to A&amp;E, about half the usual number. and referrals from GPs for heart attacks, strokes and retinal detachments are down. One trust saw an 80% drop in cancer referrals from GPs, according to NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts. Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said trusts were “very concerned”. “There are people who potentially are at risk of dying from stroke, a heart attack or another major incident, because they don’t want to turn up to A&amp;E – they think it’s either too dangerous or there just isn’t the capacity to deal with them,” Cordery said.     London’s Royal Marsden hub has been a success. Photograph: Anthony Eva/Alamy    “We’ve got trusts saying to us, ‘our A&amp;E is way too quiet – we want to encourage people to come’. That’s the first time we’ve put that message out probably in 70 years.” Siva Anandaciva, chief analyst at the King’s Fund, a health thinktank, said that although the current focus was on creating cancer centres, the NHS will need to plan for more general surgery for patients whose treatment cannot be delayed without consequences. “Where you’ve got a specialist hospital like the Marsden – so the Christie, Clatterbridge and others like them, including in the private sector, you could potentially turn them into clean hubs,” Anandaciva said. But there are fewer than 20 specialist sites, he added, and a coronavirus outbreak in a “clean” hospital could make the system precarious. The result of the reluctance to seek treatment is a higher death rate from other conditions. An extra 2,600 people a week are dying from non-Covid-19 causes, according to the Times. Professor Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “A number of people have recognised it from previous pandemics, including the flu pandemic in the UK 10 years ago and Ebola in west Africa. There always has been a rise in morbidity and mortality as a consequence of focusing on one condition.” There are signs that people are beginning to return to GPs, most of whom are operating remotely, according to Mark Sanford-Wood, deputy chair of the BMA’s GP committee. “We had a couple of weeks where it was quite quiet,” he said. “This week we’ve seen a rise in the number of contacts. Friday was much busier than the week before. As Chris Whitty said, the NHS is open for business.”"
6,cancer,Which cancer patients should be continuing chemotherapy during the coronavirus?,"From a clinic emptied of patients but not their problems, I begin a series of phone consults, the first of which is to an increasingly fatigued man who lives alone. For a while I have rued the day someone suggested he have chemotherapy because now he has poured all his energies into having intensifying toxic treatment for a terminal illness. I know that he appreciates seeing the nurses but suddenly the stakes have risen. Careful not to sound punitive, I say: “Let’s consider a chemotherapy break.” “Why, do I have the virus?” “No, but I am worried about keeping you safe.” “But stopping chemo means guaranteed death.” “It’s not so simple – let’s talk through it again.” “Don’t give up on me, doc. I trust you.” His voice breaks.   Related: Now more than ever, we have to be honest about intensive care beds | Ranjana Srivastava    Very real ethical dilemmas abound for cancer clinicians bearing the hopes and dreams of their patients, who deserve empathy but also a realistic insight into their situation. What constitutes a meaningful survival benefit: three weeks, three months or somewhere in between? Would you want to live an extra year if you spent it in a nursing home? Would you rather risk your life for a chance at cure or accept a lesser intervention to preserve quality? If your dementia was worsening, what would you want done about an asymptomatic cancer? Now we are in the grip of the coronavirus pandemic shown to particularly imperil the elderly with chronic comorbidities (ie the majority of cancer patients) although it increasingly seems the young cannot afford to be complacent either. The usual dilemmas of oncologists are suddenly compounded by a pressing new question: which cancer patients should be continuing their chemotherapy? This is a broad question with the usual caveat: “It depends.” It depends on the individual, the diagnosis, the type, duration and intent of treatment. It also depends on a patient’s philosophy and a clinician’s preparedness to ponder harm and benefit. Medical conversations in a cancer clinic are necessarily imbued with ethical implications but now is the time to approach them with particular clarity and sensitivity. Given the predicted pressure on elective surgery, resource availability, supply movement and frontline staff, it is imperative to reassess the needs of every patient, not only the ones who express concern. Field experts are circulating their suggestions in a rapidly evolving space. Meanwhile, here are some questions that all chemotherapy patients should ask their oncologist. Why am I having chemotherapy? In general, chemotherapy is given before an operation to render surgery more successful, or afterwards to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. It’s sometimes combined with radiotherapy to improve outcomes. In these cases, the intent is cure. Many common cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage; therefore, many more patients receive palliative chemotherapy, intended to halt progression and extend life but without the prospect of a cure. In a landmark study, the majority of patients with a poor prognosis believed they were receiving chemotherapy for a cure. Decisional regret is common among cancer patients; people who do not clearly understand the goals of chemotherapy cannot make decisions in their best interest. This is not news to oncologists, but now we have an even greater responsibility to ensure that the decision to continue chemotherapy has been made deliberately. How does my treatment benefit me? Many patients never ask this question for fear of sounding ungrateful, but the basis of shared decision-making is to use professional expertise to help individual priorities. It’s important for patients to understand how many people in their situation will derive benefit and what that benefit looks like. Will treatment alleviate symptoms, delay cancer progression or prolong life? Each goal is important but different.   Related: So you think you have coronavirus: what Australians should do if they are unwell    Patients are often astonished to hear that common therapies offer less than 5% benefit. The more lines of chemotherapy, the less the chance of success. Hand in hand with benefit goes harm. The mortality rate of curative intent chemotherapy is quoted between 0.5 and 4%. In one study, 7.5% of elderly patients receiving combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy for lung cancer died during treatment. And as many patients discover, impairment can persist long after treatment. A timely editorial reminds oncologists of “the efficacy-effectiveness gap”. To demonstrate the greatest efficacy, clinical trials select the fittest patients with the least comorbidities. But real-world patients are completely different – they are older, sicker and rarely treated at academic centres, therefore treatments that looked promising in clinical trials don’t always translate into effectiveness for the individual patient. Patients deserve the best of modern medicine minus the worst of complications, which is why fully informed consent takes on an additional significance during a pandemic. Have my risks changed? The usual high risks of chemotherapy are magnified during a pandemic. Immunosuppressed patients are more prone to infections and many chemotherapy agents cause mucositis, thus breaching a natural protective barrier. Frequent tests and chemotherapy visits expose already vulnerable patients to pathogens and other sick patients. Mortality from the coronavirus appears higher in cancer patients. Being at risk doesn’t necessarily mean abandoning useful treatment. But shared decision-making is essential to mitigating some risks and being prepared to handle others. Can I consider another therapy? Patients harbour a great fear of foregoing treatment, often viewing it as their failure. But evidence shows that more isn’t necessarily better, and chemotherapy may be safely de-escalated, paused or even stopped without causing harm. Experts suggest a review of new and ongoing therapies to determine options including oral substitutes. Where intensive chemotherapy remains advisable, in-person visits must be reduced. Injections to maintain blood counts and oral medications taken at home to reduce nausea, anxiety and allergies may be ways to reduce the time in the infusion centre. A word about immunotherapy agents, whose promise though not peril, is often mentioned. While distinct from chemotherapy, they are responsible for a host of immune-related complications, the most relevant of which is pneumonitis. This drug-induced lung inflammation can be difficult to distinguish from a viral infection; furthermore, conventional treatment of pneumonitis with high-dose steroids may impede recovery from coronavirus-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome. Combination immunotherapy drugs typically cause substantially greater toxicity than single agents and there is emerging evidence that stopping immunotherapy in selected patients can be associated with durable responses. Patients on immunotherapy merit a detailed discussion about which agents to continue.   Related: Coronavirus: what happens to people's lungs if they get Covid-19?    What happens if I become unwell? Mild illnesses in other patients can become catastrophic for cancer patients. Confused by instructions or reluctant to attend hospital, patients may minimise their symptoms. Every cancer patient must know whom to call and where to go in case of concern. Queuing at a fever clinic or calling a general helpline may squander the opportunity for urgent care. Emergency professionals aren’t familiar with all the nuances of cancer treatment and information isn’t always readily transferrable across institutions. Therefore, it is vital for patients to self-identify as high-risk and carry basic information about themselves. Can we discuss an advance care directive? The truth is no one wants to dwell on their mortality, not doctors, not their patients. Despite widespread recognition of the resulting harm, a discussion about end-of-life care remains a second-order task in clinic. Many people worry that in pressured times, the sickest and oldest patients will be denied intensive care but in fact, these patients face such poor outcomes that it is in their best interest to receive good palliative care from the outset. Advance care directives return control to patients, which is why we must discuss them proactively but sensitively. Finally, to something that is unspoken but important. Patients invest great trust in professionals, but what happens when those very professionals become uncertain? Can we trust shaken doctors to guide shaken patients? I think the answer is yes. A profession with its share of discord and disharmony is coalescing in unforeseen ways. There is a genuine understanding across the workforce that the only way to face this crisis is together. Humbled by a virus and equal in our vulnerability, there is a newfound concern and care for each other. Our better angels have declared themselves. Over 2,000 years ago, Hippocrates observed that the highest aim of medicine was to “cure sometimes, treat often, comfort always”. Patients should know that their providers are doing everything in their power to honour this adage.  Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar. Her latest book is called A Better Death. "
7,cancer,An existential approach to cancer,"It is breast cancer awareness month. As someone with secondary breast cancer I am aware of the disease every day. Since I was diagnosed last August I’ve been in a muddle about how to square it mentally and emotionally. Although my treatment is working, nobody knows how long for. Stage IV, secondary, advanced, metastatic, call it what you want, brings guilt and confusion about how best to be with and leave family and friends. Some may have a solution and put pressure on you to spend time at a clinic in Germany or source cannabis-related drugs or watch videos of people who have survived. I don’t understand how someone can know the cancer has pushed off for good until they die of something else. And there is a lot aside from conventional medicines to help, including acupuncture, reflexology, cancer coaching, oxygen therapy, special diets with juices and no sugar, plus the rest. Online you can find miracle cures, along with clinics where you can spend time “cleaning up”. I’m not, however, a believer. But existentialism resonates. It is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as “a philosophical theory emphasising the existence of the individual person as a free and responsible agent determining his or her own development”. Fortunately the hospital offered me an existential therapist. It’s taken almost a year to understand exactly what it means, but the penny has finally dropped. I don’t have to do what anyone else wants me to do, or worry about what they think when as an individual my experience is unique. I’ve finally squared it with the help of Jean-Paul Sartre, who said: “Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does.”Aliya HasanTwickenham, London • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

8,cancer,Terminal cancer means I won't see the other side of lockdown,"As I was lying in a hospital bed last July after complications arising from chemotherapy, my oncologist entered the room with my scan results. Hospital had become familiar to me but his next words weren’t. The treatment wasn’t working. There was little else that could be done. I pressed him to be more specific and was told bluntly that I wouldn’t last a year. I would be lucky to have half that time. This was nine months ago, before Covid-19, and I’m very unlikely to be alive to see the other side of lockdown. Almost two years ago, as summer in London was just beginning, an ultrasound to investigate a bladder infection found a large tumour on my right adrenal gland that had spread to my lungs. I was diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinoma, an extremely rare and aggressive cancer. It is in desperate need of research; when it is advanced there is very little effective treatment. This was not something I expected in my late 20s. Early on, after reading the bleak statistics, I started preparing myself for the inevitable. But treatment began positively and my focus changed to getting better. When death isn’t staring you in the face, it is easy to push back the difficult thoughts and conversations. Dying was something to address later.   Related: People with terminal illness badly need mental health support. My wife was one | Mike Addelman    Now my oncologist has said I cannot have further treatment. His reasoning is that it would leave me vulnerable to becoming ill at a time when there are not enough resources to help, and also because the nurses normally available are busy helping others. I’m still feeling good, better, in fact, without chemo. But I feel like I’m living on borrowed time. I no longer look like the archetype of someone with cancer – I’m back to my natural weight and have a full head of hair. I often feel like the old me, except with an awful attempt at a moustache. Last month, before all this started, I took the opportunity to go to Colombia. I explored that beautiful country, danced badly to reggaeton and met people from around the world. The sun was shining and most of the time everything felt normal. But the dark clouds of coronavirus were looming, and when I arrived home, the reality hit that this was the final stage of my journey. Whenever I had thought about the last few weeks of life before, I always pictured them being surrounded by friends and family. I’d eat at my favourite restaurants, go to south London parks where I’ve shared kisses and lazy days. I’d get to watch the bands that soundtracked my life in London’s festivals, and frequent the bars and beer gardens that, for better or worse, have defined my adulthood. Crucially, I’d spend time with the people whom I had shared those experiences with; who made me the person I am today. When I became sicker, we would watch films, listen to music, laugh, cry, talk – about both the big things and the little things. It would be a period that maybe only tends to come in times of tragedy, where vulnerability and urgency create connections at a higher level. Where the bittersweet feelings of love and loss exist simultaneously and we are at our most human.    Others feel time is standing still right now, but for me it is slipping through my fingers    None of this can happen right now. This “good death” described above is being denied to me due to the pandemic, and instead I face a steady decline into nothingness. Currently I am cut off from my family; my sister, who I live with, works for the NHS so is temporarily staying with friends to avoid bringing home any infection. I am one of the many vulnerable people being protected for their own benefit. Just stuck in my flat, alone. Waiting. I’m taking each day as it comes. I wake up and take a few moments to be grateful that I’m still feeling well. I eat well, exercise and have days filled with video calls and Netflix, like everybody else. After many months of chemo I’m quite used to being housebound. I’m not bored; I oscillate between feeling pensive and flat. I can’t help my thoughts sometimes running away and turning to everything I will miss out on. Planned weddings that I now can’t attend. Friends’ children I’ll never meet. People I thought I’d grow old with that I’ll never see again. Let alone what my own future would have brought. In these moments I feel devastated, and frustrated that there is no one to blame. Others feel time is standing still right now, but for me it is slipping through my fingers. I do expect to spend some quality time with my family soon. I still plan to have conversations with friends so that when I go, nothing is left unsaid, even if they are not held face to face. On top of that, I am still grateful for so much within these four walls – listening to music, learning new things or even simply looking at the beautiful view from my window.   Related: 'What a terrible time to have cancer': falling ill during the coronavirus crisis    Before cancer I considered myself very independent. This man was an island. It has been humbling to learn how much I depend on people, both physically and emotionally. I feel so fortunate to have had my people over this period, and facing the future without them is truly daunting. Whether times are good, bad, or worse, it is ultimately the people whom you love and care about that get you through. For me, these people didn’t just get me through the last two years, but somehow made them two of the best years of my life. Real connection is something that I think a lot of people in the country are missing right now. As much as possible, it is vital we keep that going, even if it is limited, and help those most in need of this – for example, elderly and homeless people: those who suffer isolation outside of an enforced lockdown. Politicians and medical experts talk about the light at the end of the tunnel. People will eventually open their doors again and restart their lives as the country attempts to move back to normality. For me, and I’m sure plenty of others in a similar position, there is no light to give me hope. The tunnel is all that there is, and I’m having to find my way in the dark. • Elliot Dallen is from Cardiff and has worked in finance in London since graduating"
9,cancer,Shannen Doherty reveals terminal cancer amid wildfire insurance battle,"The actor Shannen Doherty has revealed her battle with terminal breast cancer in an interview about her ongoing fight with State Farm, California’s largest home insurer, to receive compensation for her wildfire-damaged home. Doherty’s Malibu home was damaged by smoke from the Woolsey fire in November 2018, which killed three people, destroyed more than 1,600 buildings and burned nearly 100,000 acres. She made public the severity of her diagnosis in an interview with ABC News last week, in which Doherty called her fight with State Farm to receive compensation for home damages, temporary housing and emotional distress “one of the most horrific processes I have ever been through”.   Related: ‘Not our mission’: private fire crews protect the insured, not the public    Doherty’s initial complaint against her home’s insurer, State Farm, was filed on 13 February 2019. Her attorney claimed the insurer had “taken advantage of Ms Doherty’s vulnerability and medical condition”. State Farm denied Doherty’s claims, contending that the revelation of her health issues is a ploy “to garner sympathy”. The disaster-stricken celebrity has become a California wildfire trope. While hardly representative of the average fire-impacted homeowner, they are presumably in a far more advantageous position to defend against and recover after catastrophe. Kim and Kanye West’s private firefighters who fought off the Woolsey flames were an auspice of inequality amid the climate crisis – but Doherty’s insurance battle shows some of the limits of privilege. “If it’s this hard for somebody who’s got money and a certain amount of power, imagine how hard it is for just a regular person to fight back when their insurance company isn’t living up to their obligations,” said Amy Bach, the executive director of the not-for-profit United Policyholders, which advocates on behalf of people who are battling with insurance companies after a disaster.     A firefighter battles the Woolsey fire burning a home in Malibu, California. Photograph: Ringo HW Chiu/AP    Compared to her neighbors, Doherty was lucky: her home didn’t burn in the Woolsey fire, though she alleges it sustained significant smoke damage from proximity to the flames that left ash and char behind. Doherty contends that damage is an additional risk to her weakened health. But a partial loss, said Bach, is far more subjective and contentious than a total one. “It’s a little counterintuitive but for a lot of people it’s easier to reach a fair settlement with an insurance company promptly if your house has burned than if your house has just been damaged,” said Bach. “In addition to dropping people and raising rates, insurance companies have also adopted a much stricter approach to partial loss claims. You should be able to trust your insurance company if they tell you it’s safe to move back in. But it’s our experience that insurers are looking to control expenses.”    If it’s this hard for somebody who’s got money and a certain amount of power, imagine how hard it is for just a regular person to fight back  Amy Bach     In Doherty’s case, State Farm’s inspector claimed there was no damage. Proving the severity of hidden smoke damage can mean paying thousands of dollars for ones own inspections, on top of the already onerous insurance claims process that survivors often refer to as “the disaster after the disaster”. Insurance companies in California have reacted to the recent last few devastating and expensive wildfire seasons by raising rates and dropping policies. According to the California Department of Insurance, State Farm and other insurers declined to renew around 350,000 policies in high fire risk areas and another 33,000 in areas affected by major fires since 2015. In December, in an attempt to head off yet another disaster after the disaster, the state insurance commissioner, Ricardo Lara, announced a one-year moratorium on non-renewals for approximately 1 million people who own homes near recent wildfires. But as policymakers search for solutions to this home insurance crisis, insurers will continue to seek innovative ways to make up for years of lost profits."
10,cancer,AI system outperforms experts in spotting breast cancer,"An artificial intelligence program has been developed that is better at spotting breast cancer in mammograms than expert radiologists. 
The AI outperformed the specialists by detecting cancers that the radiologists missed in the images, while ignoring features they falsely flagged as possible tumours. 
If the program proves its worth in clinical trials, the software, developed by Google Health, could make breast screening more effective and ease the burden on health services such as the NHS where radiologists are in short supply. 
“This is a great demonstration of how these technologies can enable and augment the human expert,” said Dominic King, the UK lead at Google Health. “The AI system is saying ‘I think there may be an issue here, do you want to check?’” 
About one in eight women are diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. Screening programmes catch more than 18,000 cases each year in England alone, but tumours are still missed, giving false negative results, and some women are wrongly suspected of having cancer, in false positives that lead to unnecessary anxiety and invasive biopsies. 
Google’s AI program analyses mammograms in three different ways before combing the results to produce an overall risk score. The scientists trained the program on mammograms from more than 76,000 women in the UK and 15,000 women in the US. To see how well it worked, they then asked it to assess nearly 30,000 new mammograms from UK and US women who either had biopsy-confirmed cancer, or no signs of cancer during follow-up at least a year later. 
In the US, women who go for breast cancer screening tend to be seen every one or two years and their mammograms are examined by a single radiologist. When compared with the US system, the AI produced 5.7% fewer false positives and 9.4% fewer false negatives. 
In the UK, women are screened less often, typically once every three years, but their mammograms are reviewed by two radiologists, and sometimes a third in case of disagreement. The AI performed only marginally better than the UK system, reducing false positives by 1.2% and false negatives by 2.7%. 
The results suggest the AI could boost the quality of breast cancer screening in the US and maintain the same level in the UK, with the AI assisting or replacing the second radiologist. 
Breast cancer screening in the UK is under particular strain. The Royal College of Radiologists has identified a shortfall of at least 1,104 radiologists. In breast radiology specifically, 8% of hospital posts are unfilled, with much of the shortage due to older radiologists retiring from the NHS faster than new ones join. 
 
  
  
   
    
    Artificial Intelligence has various definitions, but in general it means a program that uses data to build a model of some aspect of the world. This model is then used to make informed decisions and predictions about future events. The technology is used widely, to provide speech and face recognition, language translation, and personal recommendations on music, film and shopping sites. In the future, it could deliver driverless cars, smart personal assistants, and intelligent energy grids. AI has the potential to make organisations more effective and efficient, but the technology raises serious issues of ethics, governance, privacy and law. 
    
   
  
  
 
Chris Kelly, a clinician scientist at Google Health, said the next major step would be a trial to assess the AI in real-world conditions. Its performance could slip when it is fed images from different mammogram systems. In the latest study, reported in Nature, nearly all of the images came from machines provided by one manufacturer. 
“Like the rest of the health service, breast imaging, and UK radiology more widely, is understaffed and desperate for help,” said Dr Caroline Rubin, vice-president for clinical radiology at the Royal College of Radiologists. “AI programs will not solve the human staffing crisis, as radiologists and imaging teams do far more than just look at scans, but they will undoubtedly help by acting as a second pair of eyes and a safety net.” 
“It is a competitive market for developers and these programs will need to be rigorously tested and regulated first. The next step for promising products is for them to be used in clinical trials, evaluated in practice and used on patients screened in real-time, a process that will need to be overseen by the UK public health agencies that have overall responsibility for the breast screening programmes.” 
Michelle Mitchell, Cancer Research UK’s chief executive, said: “Screening helps diagnose breast cancer at an early stage, when treatment is more likely to be successful, ensuring more people survive the disease. But it also has harms such as diagnosing cancers that would never have gone on to cause any problems and missing some cancers. This is still early stage research, but it shows how AI could improve breast cancer screening and ease pressure off the NHS.”"
11,cancer,Life 'hanging by a thread' for Italian cancer patients in coronavirus crisis,"Since the coronavirus outbreak hit Italy, Francesca Masi has felt her life has been hanging by a thread. She was diagnosed with myelofibrosis, a rare bone marrow cancer, in 2016 and was due to have a transplant this month, but now fears it will be postponed as the country deals with the pandemic. Access for thousands of cancer patients in need of chemotherapy, scans, transplants and surgery has become difficult, if not impossible, in Italy’s Covid-19 emergency. Across the country, dozens of specialist cancer wards and hospitals have been transformed to treat coronavirus, while others have closed after medical staff and patients were infected. There are now fewer beds in intensive care units for cancer patients. “At the beginning of my diagnosis I underwent other treatments with success, but since my conditions worsened, transplant became my only option. So to be stuck in this situation make me living in a constant state of anxiety,” says Masi, who lives and works in Pontedera, in the province of Pisa. She is 46 and the mother of a 10-year-old boy. “I now run the risk of dying, which isn’t fair, because my doctors had finally located two foreign donors whose marrow was 100% compatible with mine.” International flight restrictions to halt the spread ofcoronavirus mean marrow from overseas donors risks not arriving in Italy. Research led by Codice Viola, a charity that supports pancreatic cancer patients, and seen exclusively by the Guardian, found that of 500 mostly breast or pancreatic patients appointments for chemotherapy or radiotherapy were postponed for 24% (11% with no arranged date), while 64% of surgical procedures were postponed indefinitely. More than half have had follow-up appointments rescheduled.  Dozens of patients and doctors who spoke to the Guardian fear that the restrictive measures to contain the virus are limiting access to proper medical care for cancer patients, who also represent 17% of Italian coronavirus fatalities, according to a recent study.     Francesca Pesce has pancreatic cancer. ‘Patients are afraid of contracting the virus in hospitals. Hospitals have been forced to cancel appointments as oncologists assist in the emergency.’ Photograph: Handout    Francesca Pesce, 54, a professional translator and member of Codice Viola, has been living with metastatic pancreatic cancer for almost three years. This week she will leave Rome for a follow-up in Milan, one of the cities worst affected by the virus. “At least I have this option, which others don’t,” she said. “On the one hand, cancer patients are afraid of contracting the virus in hospitals, so they forgo their treatments; on the other, hospitals have been forced to cancel their appointments as many oncologists and anaesthetists have been moved to other wards to assist in the Covid-19 emergency.” Paolo Ascierto, an oncologist at Naples’ Pascale hospital now treating coronavirus patients, said converting cancer wards to Covid-19 units could be risky. “I understand the state of emergency, but we mustn’t forget that cancer patients require dedicated and specialised treatments. There are special conditions, like patients in follow-up, that can be managed safely using online consultations to monitor the patient’s progress. “But there are other conditions, such as metastatic patients, that must be prioritised, because a lack of constant attention can mean the difference between life and death.” In Ortona, Abruzzo, protests erupted following the announcement by local authorities that the only hospital in the region specialised in women’s cancer treatments was to be entirely converted to treat Covid-19 patients. Where cancer wards are functioning, certain diagnostic procedures, such as endescopies, may be limited, and a decrease in blood donations is limiting surgical options. “At the moment, only urgent surgical procedures are being performed,” says Pesce. “And even urgent procedures are now stymied, because of a shortage of blood due to the coronavirus emergency.” The closure of air routes to and from Italy has also made it virtually impossible for thousands of cancer patients to access treatment in other European hospitals.     Alessandra Capone has had breast cancer for 10 years. ‘You can protect yourself from coronavirus by staying at home, but cancer doesn’t follow the diktat of quarantines or decrees.’ Photograph: Handout    Alessandra Capone, 47, a dancer, feminist and human rights activist, has been living with breast cancer for 10 years. In 2015 it spread to her liver and lymph nodes and last year she began a series of treatments at University Hospital in Frankfurt with just 5% of her liver cancer-free. She is now facing enormous difficulties travelling to Germany. “I contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation but the line is always busy and I couldn’t speak to anybody. Then I contacted the Italian consulate in Frankfurt. They told me I need a number of certifications for travelling to another country, even for health reasons. Not to mention that in Germany very few hotels are accepting reservations, especially from Italians, during this emergency. It’s very stressful.” For the first time, however, the Italian government last week authorised an air force flight to Turkey to secure haemopoietic stem cells from a donor for a two-year-old boy whose condition had worsened. Travel is also limited within Italy, where patients from Sicily, Puglia and Calabria often undergo treatments and operations in richer Veneto and Lombardy, which are among the worst affected regions in the country for Covid-19. Grazia De Michele, 39, a blogger and researcher in the history of medicine, lives in Foggia, in Puglia, and has been living with breast cancer since 2010. A few months ago, her mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. “My mother was supposed to have a CT scan in March to see if the chemo she’s on is working, but the scan was postponed,” she says. “I was supposed to undergo an oophorectomy, and my operation was postponed as well.”     Grazia De Michele has breast cancer. ‘My mother was supposed to have a CT scan to see if the chemo’s working. My operation was postponed as well.’ Photograph: Handout    “You have to imagine what it’s like for cancer patients,” says Capone. “Many live in a constant state of anxiety, with the fear of dying. The situation caused by the coronavirus emergency has put them under enormous psychological and physical distress. You see, you can protect yourself from coronavirus by staying at home, but it’s not the same with cancer. Cancer doesn’t follow the diktat of quarantines or decrees. It keeps going, in war and in peace.”"
12,cancer,Robots steady breast cancer surgeon's hands in first human trial,"Doctors have used a robot to perform extremely delicate surgical operations on breast cancer patients in the first human trial of the technology. Eight women had the robot-assisted procedure at Maastricht University Medical Center, in the Netherlands, to alleviate a common complication of breast cancer surgery. The robot helped a specialist surgeon divert thread-like lymphatic vessels, as narrow as 0.3mm, around scar tissue in the patients’ armpits, and connect them to nearby blood vessels. The operation, which requires immense care and precision, is offered to some breast cancer patients to reduce swelling in the arms that builds up when the lymphatic system cannot drain properly. Because the vessels are so small, surgeons need exceptionally steady hands to perform the operation well. “This is the first time in the world that such an operation has been performed with a robot,” said Tom van Mulken, a consultant plastic surgeon at the hospital. “It’s a very delicate and tricky procedure.” Breast cancer-related lymphedema, as the condition is known, affects about one-third of breast cancer survivors within two years of having surgery to remove their tumours. The problem can arise when surgeons remove lymph nodes from the armpit to investigate whether the cancer has spread. In some cases, scar tissue forms and blocks the lymphatic system, the network of vessels that carries immune cells around the body and drains away its cellular waste. Writing in Nature Communications, researchers in Maastricht and at Eindhoven University of Technology describe a pilot trial in which a specialist surgeon used the robot to re-route lymphatic vessels around women’s scar tissue. The surgeon operated on 20 women and used the robot in eight of those procedures. The robot works by cancelling out tiny tremors in the surgeon’s hands and scaling down their hand movements. For example, if the surgeon moves one of the robot’s joysticks one centimetre, the fine tweezers at the end of the robot arm may move only a tenth of a millimetre. “We suture the vessels together with very fine needles and thread, so if you have a tremor you rupture the vessels,” Van Mulken said. “It’s very delicate surgery and only a few people are very good at it. It shouldn’t be like that if you use a robot.” The trial showed that, on average, the specialist surgeon took more than twice as long, about 25 minutes, to perform the procedure when they used the robot. But over time, the surgeon became quicker with the robot and by the end of the trial had the time down to 16 minutes. Because so few women were enrolled in the trial, it was impossible to discern any meaningful differences between the quality of the surgery, a question that will need to be answered by larger trials in the future. Van Mulken believes the results are encouraging because they demonstrate how robots can be used for extremely fine surgical procedures. If larger trials prove their worth, the robots could allow more surgeons to perform very delicate operations, and smooth out variations in their day-to-day performance. “We already enhance our eyes with microscopes, but up until now, we still had to do the surgery with our hands. The microscopes are getting stronger and stronger, so our eyes are not the problem, but our hands cannot keep up any more,” Van Mulken said. More operations are likely to benefit from robotic assistance, he added, including neurosurgery and the reattachment of severed fingers, where fine nerves and blood vessels must be sewn back together.  “Right now, if a piece is too small, we have to throw it in the bin,” he said."
13,cancer,"Cervical cancer could be eliminated in England, experts say","Experts say cervical cancer could be eliminated in England through a combination of the vaccine and NHS screening, which will now test every woman for HPV, the virus that causes most cases of the disease. NHS England’s experts say there is potential to end the disease, which kills 850 women a year in the UK. The vaccine given to girls from the age of 12 is known to be very effective against HPV infection. From the beginning of December, routine screening has been reoriented to test primarily for the virus. Only women who have HPV will have their smear sample checked for abnormal cells that are the precursor of cervical cancer.   Related: Cervical cancer is an avoidable disease – in theory, at least    Prof Peter Johnson, the national clinical director for cancer, said: “Screening is one of the most effective ways of protecting against cervical cancer and there is no doubt this new way of testing will save lives,. It is vitally important that all eligible people attend for their screening appointments, to keep themselves safe.   Related: Cervical cancer is an avoidable disease – in theory, at least    “Combined with the success of the HPV vaccine for both boys and girls, we hope that cervical cancer can be eliminated altogether by the NHS in England. The chances of surviving cancer are at a record high, but there is always more we can do, as we continue to deliver our long-term plan.” The NHS believes 600 cases of cervical cancer – roughly a quarter of the 2,500 cases detected in England – could be prevented by the new HPV screening test. As the generations of young women given the vaccine get older, the numbers of cases of cervical cancer are expected to drop substantially. Australian academics writing in the Lancet medical journal last year estimated that comprehensive vaccination and screening could bring the caseload down to fewer than four in 100,000 women, a level at which the cancer would be considered virtually eliminated. The UK rate is just below 10 per 100,000.   Related: Broadest ever therapeutic HPV vaccine to be tested in clinical trial    Vaccination is expected to make a big difference to the chances of girls and women in low- and middle-income countries that have the most cases and where there are no routine screening programmes. Experts are enthusiastic about the prospects. Robert Music, the chief executive of the campaigning charity Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust, said: “It is exciting that we are seeing advances in cervical cancer prevention and must continue to look to the future to make sure our cervical screening programme continues to adapt and evolve. “The day that cervical cancer is a disease of the past is one we should be aiming to get to as soon as possible. Cervical screening is such an important test, but there are many reasons it can be difficult to attend. We must continue to understand and tackle these to ensure as many women benefit from this far more sensitive test and we save as many cancers diagnoses and lives as possible.” Prof Anne Mackie, the director of screening at Public Health England, said: “With HPV vaccinations for all year 8 pupils and HPV testing available nationally, cervical cancer promises to become very rare indeed. This is a truly momentous achievement, but to ensure we consign this disease to the past we must keep vaccination rates high and continue to provide safe and acceptable screening for all women.” Jo Churchill, the public health minister, encouraged all women to continue to be screened. She said: “Thousands fewer women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer as a result of improved screening services and the HPV vaccine and it’s incredible to think that cervical cancer could be eradicated for good. “The NHS long-term plan has committed to an overhaul of screening programmes, new investment in state-of-the-art technology and a boost in research, which will help more people survive cancer each year. I encourage all women to attend screening appointments.” • This article was amended on 20 January 2020. An earlier version said the rate of cervical cancer in the UK was “just below 80 per 100,000”. In fact the figure is just below 10 per 100,000."
14,cancer,Residents of Cancer Town urge tougher measures to monitor toxins,"Environmental Protection Agency officials on Tuesday pleaded with community members in Reserve, Louisiana, to back a new air monitoring system being installed by the agency, which they claim will better measure pollutants from a nearby chemical plant emitting the likely human carcinogen chloroprene. Reserve, the subject of a year-long Guardian series, Cancer Town, is home to the highest risk of cancer due to airborne toxins, according to EPA data, which found that a census tract next door to the plant has a cancer risk 50 times the national average. The EPA has been monitoring chloroprene emissions at six sites near the plant, which is run by the Japanese chemicals firm Denka, since 2016 but recently announced plans to alter how it records emissions. The agency currently takes a routine air reading once every six days, with chloroprene emissions regularly dozens of times above the lifetime exposure threshold recommended by the agency of 0.2 micrograms per cubic meter.   Related: 'Almost every household has someone that has died from cancer'    The new system, involving new monitors named Spods, will be designed to catch “spikes” in chloroprene whenever they occur, meaning officials expect more readings to occur throughout the programme’s six-month length. “Our goal on this is to find chloroprene,” said David Gray, deputy regional director of the EPA’s region six office at a community meeting in Reserve on Tuesday evening. The official told residents that the agency had not yet decided at what level a “spike” would be determined but that it was likely to be well above the agency’s own lifetime exposure guidance of 0.2 micrograms. The monitors will also not directly measure for chloroprene itself, but other volatile compounds that researchers believe indicate heightened chloroprene presence in the ambient air. Speaking to the Guardian after the meeting, Gray said the ultimate timeframe of the program had not been assigned, but officials were determined to capture a so-called “turnaround” at the plant, when day-to-day operations are ceased for renewal and it is expected elevated levels of chloroprene are released into the air. He suggested that data showing chloroprene spikes would allow the EPA to engage with plant operators and work on ways to reduce emissions. “Clearly for us it’s fastest if people act voluntarily, if we show them things that are reasonable, easy to do, give great benefit and don’t cost a lot,” Gray said. “But we do have the harder toolbox, which is legal and enforcement.” The new monitoring system was met with some criticism by local community members who have urged the EPA to take a harder enforcement line on Denka and also to measure for other pollutants in the air in Reserve. “We need to do it, and do it quickly because too many generations have been damaged by this,” said Margaret Fiedler, a local resident. “It affects the ability of the children to learn. I’m at the end of my road, but I don’t want to see the children in Fifth Ward [an elementary school next to the plant] have learning disabilities.” Gray was also questioned by lawyers representing residents in a class-action lawsuit against Denka, over a short series of emails the official had with the plant’s manager, which lawyers suggested indicated a close relationship between the EPA and Denka. Gray rejected the suggestion. “It is not my intention to come here and undercut you in any way,” he told the meeting. “I am committed to this project … It breaks my heart to make you think anything else.” A spokesman for Denka said on Wednesday that the company had no position on the new air monitoring system, but suggested the old system had given the public “considerable information”. The company have frequently highlighted the $35m spent to install emissions controls in recent years. Denka said these installations have reduced chloroprene emissions by 86%. It has been challenged on this claim by the Louisiana department of environmental quality (LDEQ)."
15,cancer,"Signs of cancer can appear long before diagnosis, study shows","Early signs of cancer can appear years or even decades before diagnosis, according to the most comprehensive investigation to date of the genetic mutations that cause healthy cells to turn malignant. The findings, based on samples from more than 2,500 tumours and 38 cancer types, reveal a longer-than-expected window of opportunity in which patients could potentially be tested and treated at the earliest stages of the disease. The work was carried out as part of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes project, the most comprehensive study of cancer genetics to date. “What’s extraordinary is how some of the genetic changes appear to have occurred many years before diagnosis, long before any other signs that a cancer may develop, and perhaps even in apparently normal tissue,” said Clemency Jolly, a co-author of the research based at the Francis Crick Institute in London. “Unlocking these patterns means it should now be possible to develop new diagnostic tests that pick up signs of cancer much earlier,” said Peter Van Loo, co-lead author, also of the Crick Institute. “There is a window of opportunity.” The discovery that the seeds of cancer are often sown many years before the first symptoms arise will not change cancer screening in the immediate term. But it points to the possibility that those at risk could be spotted far earlier.   Related: Breast cancer may be detected by blood test five years before clinical signs show    The study revealed that about half of the earliest mutations occurred in just nine genes, meaning there is a relatively small pool of common genes that serve as triggers for cells to diverge from healthy development to a path towards cancer. It might be possible, in future, to pick up such mutations using so-called liquid biopsies – genetic tests that detect mutations in free-floating DNA carried in the blood that can indicate the presence of tumours elsewhere in the body. “One could try and identify these [early mutations] and do some kind of very sensitive imaging on patients that were positive,” said Van Loo. “Or even further into the future, one could conceive of methods that really targeted these cells and made them light up in an imaging approach or just kill them in one go. That’s a bit science fiction at the moment.” About 363,000 new cancer cases are reported in the UK every year, according to Cancer Research UK, with the disease causing 165,000 deaths annually. The team analysed and sequenced nearly 2,700 whole genomes of cancer samples and mapped mutations in 38 different types of tumours. While human cells undergo billions of mutations, only a small number of them, called driver mutations, give rise to cancer. The researchers looked at how many times a single change, or driver mutation, had been replicated and copied across chromosomes. Using what they describe as a “carbon-dating method”, they were able to reconstruct the order in which the genomes of cancer cells started to accumulate errors and eventually carry large segments that had been scrambled or copied. The team found that these mutations occurred “particularly early” in ovarian cancer as well as in two types of brain tumour, glioblastoma and medulloblastoma. The analysis is published in Nature as part of a wider collection of 22 papers from the Pan-Cancer project.   Related: Are genetic tests useful to predict cancer?    Previous research on cancer genetics has focused on the so-called coding regions of the genome, which contain the instructions for cells to make proteins. Lincoln Stein, of the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research in Canada, who is also a member of the Pan-Cancer project steering committee, said: “The vast majority of work so far has been on the protein coding portion of the genome. That’s a mere 1%. It’s like trying to put together a 100,000-piece jigsaw puzzle when you’re missing 99% of the pieces and there’s no puzzle box with a completed picture to guide you.” The latest research provides some of the first detailed insights into the role of the other 99% of our DNA – the genome’s “dark matter” – and how these less-studied regions contribute to cancer. The study identifies several important genes that lie outside the coding region. Stein said these newly identified genes would increase the proportion of patients for whom a cancer-causing mutation could be pinpointed from about two-thirds to 95%. “Prior to that, we would be in the dark about roughly one-third of patients that came into the clinic,” Stein added."
16,cancer,"Common toxin made in gut can cause bowel cancer, scientists find","Scientists have raised fresh hopes for preventing bowel cancer after discovering that a common gut bacterium drives genetic mutations that can cause the disease. Researchers found that a toxin secreted by a particular strain of the microbe E coli creates distinct mutations in DNA, which contribute to an estimated one in 20 bowel cancers in Britain. The breakthrough suggests that thousands of cases of the disease might be prevented, or at least delayed, by screening for the strain and eradicating the bug in those who test positive. The treatment could involve a course of antibiotics followed by a faecal transplant to re-establish a healthy microbiome. “We will be looking at its presence in individuals with and without cancer and whether it helps in bowel cancer screening,” said Philip Quirke, a professor of pathology at Leeds University and a senior researcher on the study. About 20% of the healthy population are thought to carry the bug. Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in Britain, with 42,000 new cases diagnosed each year. More than half could be prevented by a better diet, foregoing alcohol, quitting smoking and maintaining a healthy weight. While gut microbes have also been implicated in the disease, scientists have struggled to nail down how. Hans Clevers and others at Hubrecht University in the Netherlands investigated the effects of a toxin called colibactin, which is produced by certain strains of E coli and another gut microbe called Klebsiella pneumoniae. Previous studies have shown that colibactin can damage the DNA in living cells. The scientists grew tiny pieces of human intestine known as “miniguts” and injected them with colibactin-producing E coli on weekdays for five months. At the end of each week, the miniguts were treated with antibiotics to wipe out the infections. “If we don’t treat them, they fill up with bacteria and explode,” Clevers told the Guardian. After five months, the researchers extracted DNA from the miniguts and compared the genetic material with that taken from a control group. These had been treated the same way, but with a strain of E Coli that had its colibactin-making machinery disabled. “What we noticed was a unique mutational signature,” Clevers said. Colibactin gets in among the Gs, Ts, Cs and As on the DNA double helix and binds an A on one strand to an A on the other, the scientists found. The linkage means the DNA cannot be unzipped, effectively rendering it useless. The affected cell tries to mend the glitch but often botches the repair. The researchers next searched for the mutational smoking gun in more than 5,000 DNA samples taken from patients with various cancers. It was present in more than 5% of colorectal cancers, but fewer than 0.1% of others. Among the others that bore the telltale genetic signature were cancers of the mouth and bladder, two areas that E coli can infect. Strikingly, according to the study in Nature, many of the bowel cancers had multiple colibactin-related mutations, with some damaging a key anticancer gene called APC. By mutating the gene, colibactin weakened the body’s defences against the tumours. It will take more work to understand the full implications of the discovery. Scientists must now find out how common colibactin-induced mutations are in the general population, how the number of mutations vary from person to person and whether those numbers correlate strongly with cancer risk. “If this is strengthened by other studies, it might not be a bad plan to screen and treat people,” Clevers said. In the meantime, he urged people to be cautious about a related microbe called E coli nissle, which also secretes colibactin. The bug is sold as a probiotic and is going through clinical trials for conditions ranging from constipation to childhood diarrhoea and irritable bowel syndrome. “It might help in the short run, but it’s probably going to cause cancer in the long run,” Clevers said. Mike Stratton, the director of the Wellcome Sanger Institute near Cambridge, found the same mutational signature in research published last year but had no idea what caused it. His work showed that the mutations built up by the age of 10, in line with the gut being colonised with bugs after birth. “If the exposure is taking place within the first decade of life, we may need to diagnose it within the first decade of life and treat it to avoid the mutations being generated,” he said. “The key value of this work is that they’ve identified colibactin as the cause of this mutational signature and really for the first time demonstrated that a component of our microbiome can cause mutations in a human being. That is a really important observation,” Stratton added. Scientists will now hunt for other bacteria that may be mutating DNA with other toxic substances."
17,cancer,"Late diagnosis of lung cancer hitting survival rate, study says","People with lung cancer are dying after being diagnosed late in A&amp;E because their GP missed signs of the disease despite often repeated visits, experts have revealed. As many as 56% of people in some parts of England who get lung cancer are only diagnosed when they visit A&amp;E, according to a report by the UK Lung Cancer Coalition. They are five times more likely to die within a year than those whose condition has been identified either by their GP or through the NHS cancer screening programme. Family doctors often fail to diagnose cases of lung cancer until it is too late to treat effectively or miss them altogether, leading patients to seek help at A&amp;E, the report says. More than a third of lung cancer patients see their GP three or more times before being referred for tests. That is a key factor in the UK’s poor record, in international terms, at diagnosing the disease early. Lung cancer is the third commonest form of cancer in the UK and the biggest cancer killer, claiming 35,000 lives a year. “People diagnosed in A&amp;E are dying as a result of delays in identifying their illness. Late diagnosis makes lung cancer harder to treat and is a major reason why we have such poor survival in the UK,” said Prof Mick Peake, chair of the coalition’s clinical advisory group. It is “a travesty” that admission to hospital as a medical emergency is the single commonest way the disease is diagnosed, added Peake, who is also the clinical director of the Centre for Cancer Outcomes at University College Hospital London. GPs’ failure to spot symptoms of lung cancer is only one reason for Britain’s low rate of early diagnosis and high rate of lung cancer mortality, Peake stressed. However, he added: “There is good evidence that there are missed opportunities for earlier diagnosis in primary care and we strongly urge GPs to have a low threshold for doing a chest X-ray or CT scan in patients where there is any suspicion of lung cancer.” Patients’ reluctance to have symptoms, such as a persistent cough, checked out can delay diagnosis too, especially those from poorer households and older people. NHS data cited by Peake shows a postcode lottery in which Tower Hamlets in east London has the highest proportion of patients whose disease is diagnosed in A&amp;E – 56.2% – closely followed by Manchester (56.1%) and Leeds south and east (54%). More than 50% of patients are also diagnosed in A&amp;E in Salford, Hull, South Tyneside and Sunderland. In contrast, only 14.7% of sufferers in Guildford and Waverley in Surrey are diagnosed that way, with low rates also in Wokingham in Berkshire (15.7%) and Harrogate (16%). Dr Moira Fraser-Pearce, director of policy, campaigns and influence at Macmillan Cancer Support, said that staff shortages in NHS cancer services and heavy workloads were exacerbating the complex reasons for the high level of diagnosis in A&amp;E. Macmillan has helped NHS England develop a new way of screening smokers and other high-risk patients for lung cancer by offering tests in trucks, often situated in supermarket car parks. The NHS did not comment directly on the findings but a spokesperson said that: “The NHS is catching more cancers earlier when they are easier to treat, resulting in record lung cancer survival rates.” Targeted lung health checks in locations such as supermarket car parks will detect “thousands more cases of cancer that might not have been detected otherwise, saving even more lives”, they added. NHS England has pledged to diagnose three in four cases of cancer at an early stage by 2028. Currently 57% of lung cancers are diagnosed late, greatly reducing chance of survival. • This article was amended on 31 January 2020. The original version said that the NHS had “declined to comment” on the findings of the report. This has been amended to make clear that, while it did not comment directly on the findings, the quotes that followed had been given in response."
18,cancer,'Systemic failure' led to misdiagnosis of woman with cervical cancer,"The husband of a nurse who died from cervical cancer after she was wrongly told that a smear test and biopsy were normal has expressed concern at her inquest that there could be many other “victims”. Julie O’Connor, 49, from Thornbury, South Gloucestershire, repeatedly went to see her GP over a 14-month period, complaining of gynaecological problems, and was referred three times to Southmead hospital in Bristol for further tests. Finally, O’Connor went to see a consultant at a private hospital, where cancer was diagnosed. She underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy but died in a hospice less than 12 months after the cancer was confirmed. O’Connor’s husband, Kevin, 50, who works for the Civil Aviation Authority, said there were “systemic failures” by North Bristol NHS Trust in the care of his wife and raised concerns about the investigations into what went wrong.     Kevin O’Connor holds a picture of his wife Julie outside Avon coroner’s court in Flax Bourton, near Bristol. Photograph: Rod Minchin/PA    “I am concerned about the trust’s ability to learn from past mistakes. The root cause analysis does not look at the root underlying cause,” he said. “The root cause analysis does not account for further potential victims. I am extremely concerned that a proper wider independent investigation has not taken place. “This negligence is of serious public concern and should scrutinise present and past decisions. There may be other victims who have received false negative pathology reports, and false gynaecology clinician examinations, at the North Bristol NHS Trust, who need to be reviewed.” Gynaecologists told O’Connor in October 2015 that an endometrial biopsy was negative, and the hospital had also provided a “false positive” result to a routine smear test carried out the previous year. Avon coroner’s court heard that by August 2016, O’Connor had returned to her GP with the same symptoms, and a coil was fitted to try to help. The GP also sent O’Connor back to Southmead, raising the possibility of cervical cancer, and the nurse was seen within two weeks but told her cervix “looked normal”. By November she was still unwell, and her GP made a third referral to the specialists who saw her in February 2017. The inquest heard she was due to undergo further tests at Southmead the following month, but decided to instead see a consultant at a private hospital. On examining her, they immediately suspected cervical cancer, which was later confirmed. Further tests showed signs her cancer had spread. O’Connor said: “Given the number of false negative pathology reports reported by the North Bristol NHS Trust pathology department, Julie was, and I remain gravely concerned that she was not the only patient who had false negative reports, and there may be many more patients who will suffer from cancer which could have been diagnosed earlier. “I am also concerned about the number of gynaecologists who examined Julie in her NHS care, and none of them identified a cervical cancer leading to further tests, despite Julie’s GP highlighting concerns about Julie’s cervix.” The inquest continues."
19,cancer,Short-staffed NHS failing on bowel cancer detection in England,"The NHS is failing to detect about 1,100 cases of bowel cancer a year in England because diagnostic services are so short-staffed, according to analysis by Cancer Research UK. The charity has said people’s health may suffer if the disease has progressed to a later stage as a result of going undiagnosed. It said pledges to diagnose more cancers earlier might not be delivered. Cancer Research UK said that a lack of radiographers, radiologists and endoscopists meant hospitals could not keep up with the growing number of people with suspected cancer being referred for tests. About one in 10 such posts are lying vacant.   Related: Offer cancer screenings during lunch breaks, report urges    Sara Hiom, the charity’s director of early diagnosis, said: “The UK’s bowel cancer screening programme is very effective at detecting cancer early. But we’re concerned that NHS staff shortages are having a direct impact on the ability to diagnose more patients at an early stage, something the government committed to doing last year. “People shouldn’t be slipping through the net.” Cancer Research UK is concerned that as many as 1,100 people a year in England with bowel cancer are not being picked up because the NHS there used a higher threshold than Scotland in screening for the disease using the faecal immunochemical test. In Scotland those whose testing shows they have 80 micrograms of haemoglobin per gram of faeces are referred to have a colonoscopy to determine if they have bowel cancer. In contrast, in England only those with 120 micrograms go on to have further investigation. That is despite research showing that the lower the threshold, the more cases are detected and thus lives are saved. The charity said: “This is where patients are missing out in potentially life-saving early diagnoses, largely due to a lack of specialist staff.” It said that if the NHS in England used the same lower threshold for deciding on referrals then it would undertake 2,000 more endoscopies a month but would detect 1,100 more cases a year. Dr Lisa Wilde, the director of research and external affairs at Bowel Cancer UK, said: “We know that the biggest constraint to increasing the sensitivity of England’s bowel cancer screening test is a lack of NHS workforce. Bowel cancer is the UK’s second biggest cancer killer but it doesn’t need to be: it is treatable and curable especially if diagnosed early.” Bowel cancer screening starts at 50 in Scotland. It begins at 55 in England, though the NHS has pledged to reduce it to 50 at some point in the future. An NHS spokesperson said: “The NHS has already introduced a new and more accurate way to test for bowel cancer that will catch 1,500 more cancers a year at an earlier stage and will save thousands of lives, alongside other important improvements through the NHS long-term plan, including lowering the bowel screening age to 50 and improving the sensitivity of the screening test.” Prostate cancer has overtaken breast cancer as the UK’s most commonly diagnosed form of the disease, according to the most recent annual cancer registration figures published on Monday."
20,cancer,Hull's Angus MacDonald on surviving cancer: 'I felt there was no way back',"“In my head that was me hanging my boots up – maybe not right there and then, but I felt like there was no way back for me,” says Angus MacDonald of what in August, at a hospital in Sheffield, he could not help but perceive was the beginning of the end of his football career. “As soon as the doctor said: ‘You have bowel cancer,’ that was it. I don’t remember too much of the appointment after that. I switched off and went numb. Luckily, I had the physio from the club with me and he took all of the information in because I sat back in my chair staring out of the window thinking: ‘How long have I got?’”   Related: How Sonny Pike, the wonderkid who fell to earth, is guiding young players    Suddenly football was immaterial but, after being given the all-clear in December, MacDonald slowly navigated a route back to the pitch and last month, two operations and 556 days from his previous appearance in a Hull City shirt, he played an hour for the under-23s after weeks of building up fitness at home and at training. “To actually be in a little stadium playing against a team I didn’t know, that was the real ‘Shit, I’m back, I’ve made it’ kind of thing. I think the last time I felt that good was when I was 15, getting a call-up to play for the reserves at Reading. To come back in and be involved with the music on … I was like: ‘Where’s my shin pads, where’s my boots, where’s everything at?’ It was such a feel-good moment.” But, in terms of raw emotion, it is difficult to top the outpouring of relief that followed his positive news before Christmas. His diagnosis last summer compounded a trying couple of years, with MacDonald, who also suffered from colitis, missing almost all of last season with deep vein thrombosis after a blood clot in his right calf. Then came the biopsies and colonoscopies, one of which led to the doctor calling MacDonald back to the hospital as a matter of urgency.     Angus MacDonald (right) in action against Sheffield Wednesday in April 2018. Photograph: Ashley Allen/Getty Images    It has been a mental slog but the 27-year-old is hugely grateful for the support of his parents, Jane and Rob, his three sisters, Sophie, Emma and Rebecca, and his partner, the pop star Alexandra Burke. Before an operation to remove his large bowel, which left him with a colostomy bag for nine weeks, Hull afforded MacDonald some headspace, allowing him to have a break in Dubai and then Japan, where Burke was starring in the musical The Bodyguard. “I ended up learning all the words, all the dance moves,” he says, laughing. “I supported her on tour and she supported me and what I was going through. To be able to have some time off during that period was great, to get away from it and switch off from the fact I had bowel cancer and I was going to go through two major operations.” He did not want to tell his family, let alone the world – “I didn’t want to upset anyone or have anyone worrying about me” – but once news of his diagnosis filtered through to the footballing fraternity, the former Barnsley and Torquay defender found himself overwhelmed by a deluge of messages. “I had to turn my phone off because it kept freezing,” he says, laughing. Before Hull played Wigan in September, their players warmed up in shirts bearing MacDonald’s name and number – “I was in bed high on morphine but I checked my phone and it brought a tear to my eye” – while the support of Joe Thompson, the former Rochdale midfielder who twice overcame Hodgkin lymphoma, was particularly pertinent and helped to provide crumbs of comfort at a dark time. “He reached out straight away and we kept in touch. He was great and I cannot thank him enough. I’ve probably made a friend for life in Joe.”     Hull players warm up in MacDonald shirts last September. Photograph: Anna Gowthorpe/BPI/Shutterstock    MacDonald had been counting down the days to a first-team return before English football shut down owing to the coronavirus pandemic but he acknowledges such targets pale into insignificance at times such as these. “Football needs to take a backseat because people are losing their lives over this virus – that is more important than trying to finish the season. Every day is a blessing. You cannot take things for granted. If things get you down or you have a bad day, I don’t sit and dwell on it like I used to. If I’m not involved in the team or things like that, I just get on with it and know that there’s going to be better days ahead. “Everything has made me a lot stronger mentally. I had an inkling I was going to be involved against Charlton [on 14 March, when a postponed league game was originally scheduled] and then ‘boom’ everything has stopped again. It has been one thing after the other but you have to stay positive. This isn’t going to last for ever and I’m making sure I’m ready to perform and fitter than ever.”     The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.    He is speaking after a morning run in London – Hull’s players continue to train in isolation – but when that moment eventually arrives MacDonald knows emotion is likely to get the better of him. “I think I’ll probably cry. I didn’t know if I’d ever make a comeback and to finally step back on the pitch in a Championship game would really make everything come together. “Doctors said there were lots of possibilities but no guarantees the operations were going to be as successful as they were so everything was up in the air. I’ve been through so much but hopefully stepping back on that pitch would put it all to bed and show people what I’m made of. I’m just hoping it won’t be in front of no fans…”"
21,cancer,'What a terrible time to have cancer': falling ill during the coronavirus crisis,"It’s been almost 24 hours since my surgery, and the sedation has finally worn off. I’m feeling sore, and I can’t seem to shake the feeling that there’s a stick running up the side of my neck. But I’ve heard that fades in a couple days. I’m sitting in my backyard in Bellevue, Washington, soaking up the rare bit of Pacific north-west sunshine. I’m thinking about taking my 15-year-old son and 20-year-old daughter to the game store tonight, to pick up a copy of Animal Crossing. It’s a no-contact pickup, so we’ll be observing the distancing rules, but at least driving in the car will give us a little break from the house. We’ve all been homebound for the past week, except for the occasional walk and doctor’s appointment. I know people in my community are still shopping at the grocery store and until recently kids had been playing together outside. But with my cancer, my son’s asthma and my husband’s artificial heart valve, we’re being very careful. When I stepped through the doors of Overlake hospital in Bellevue to have the surgery, I knew instantly that this visit would be very different from the previous ones. I have become a fairly regular visitor recently. The first sign that something was wrong with me came suddenly, when I was rushed to the emergency room for bad vaginal bleeding and given three blood transfusions. A week later, I was diagnosed with stage 2 cervical cancer on 26 February. I was terrified. I felt all sorts of waves of, am I going to die? Are my two kids now going to be left with a lifetime of depression and questions about why their mom isn’t there for them? It was days before the first person died from coronavirus in the US, just a few miles away from me in Kirkland. The virus was on my radar, but no one was really thinking about it locally yet. In just a few weeks, it has overwhelmed the state. I know this diagnosis would be difficult under any circumstances. I’m 49, and still have so many plans. But now, there is also this virus that can be deadly for people who are immunocompromised, like I will be soon. Between new regulations about social distancing and announcements about closures, day-to-day life seems to be changing from moment to moment. Sometimes it feels like there’s a cruel race being run to see what will kill me first – cancer, coronavirus or stress. When I was in hospital for this latest visit, the scene outside the elevator was now strangely unfamiliar. A security guard was waiting as the doors opened. Hospital staff quizzed me and my husband, Eric, about where we had travelled recently and our coughing history. They took our temperatures. We were given badges detailing exactly which parts of the hospital we were allowed to walk through, before being sent to another screening point.     Heather Chaney.: ‘I’m worried about how my kids are handling all of this isolation while also facing my diagnosis.’ Photograph: Grant Hindsley/The Guardian    I’ve been reading all about the rising coronavirus case numbers in Washington. But suddenly it felt so real. As I sat with an intake staff member, the scene around me seemed to slow. I nervously scanned the room for anyone coughing or wearing a mask. Questions shot into my head: have I touched anything? Did I use hand sanitizer when I walked through the second checkpoint? I had come to get my chemotherapy port put in, the first big step on my nine-week cancer treatment journey. Medication can be delivered into the port rather than into a vein, which means fewer needles. After this, I’ve been told to expect weeks of near-daily radiation and once-a-week intravenous chemo, followed by brachytherapy, a type of internal radiation. Inside a small room with a bed and glass doors covered in curtains, I changed into a gown and settled in for my six-hour stay for the surgery. Nurses streamed in and out. They were attentive and compassionate, but I could sense something frantic happening in the halls. I met with my doctor and talked with an anesthesiologist, who expressed surely what others were thinking: what a terrible time to have to have cancer. They led me back to the operating room, where they took an X-ray to find the right place for the port. I was sedated for about an hour and by the time I woke up, the device had been safely inserted on the right side of my chest, just under my clavicle. I was offered food and told to take Tylenol if I felt uncomfortable at home. But my husband wasn’t there. We’ve been married for 22 years, and, although he doesn’t get to be the caretaker much, he’s really good at it. I wanted him at my bed, reassuring me as I woke up that it was all finished and everything had gone well. I learned later that when he’d returned to the hospital, security hadn’t let him past the main doors, but no one would tell him why. I’m worried about how my kids are handling all of this isolation while also facing my diagnosis. My son is out of school and can’t see his friends in person. My daughter has autism and Marfan syndrome, and I’ve always been the one she can rely on. She won’t let anyone else do her hair. I’m not sleeping much these days. I just can’t seem to get all of this out of my head. My doctor told me that if I have a fever of 100.5 or higher, they won’t be able to continue with treatment. And if I get coronavirus, that could mean weeks without radiation or chemo.     Heather Chaney: ‘Luckily, my years-long love of hotel and airline amenities has finally paid off. I have a giant bag of little hand sanitizers and soaps.’ Photograph: Grant Hindsley/The Guardian    If we pause treatment, who knows how the cancer will have progressed by then or even what the healthcare system in this state or country will look like at that point. I’ve heard from close friends who are nurses about a shortage of gloves and masks. Will there be enough protective equipment for my treatments to carry on? My doctor tells me by week two or three of chemo and radiation, I’m going to be immunocompromised, so I’ve prepared for not being able to leave the house except for hospital appointments. My husband is working from home. I filled everyone’s prescriptions and stocked up on food I know my kids will eat. Luckily, my years-long love of hotel and airline amenities has finally paid off. I have a giant bag of little hand sanitizers and soaps, so I didn’t have to go out for any of that. My daughter is transgender and I have to wear surgical gloves when I give her hormone therapy, so I ordered some extra from Amazon. It’s scary staring out at a future filled with unknowns. But at least there’s one thing I know for sure. I’m as prepared as I can be. Heather Chaney, 49, is a stay-at-home mom from Bellevue, Washington. Follow her treatment journey in her weekly column"
22,cancer,"Cervical cancer is an avoidable disease – in theory, at least","Each year more than half a million women worldwide receive a cervical cancer diagnosis but, as the World Health Organization has made clear, the burden of the disease on people and health services is almost entirely avoidable. In principle, at least. The reason is that nearly all cases of cervical cancer can be traced back to long-term infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). Prevent the virus from taking hold, using the effective vaccines already on the market as well as screening to catch and treat abnormal cells before they turn into cancer, and rates of the disease can be slashed.   Related: Cervical cancer could be eliminated in England, experts say    HPV is not a single virus. There are more than 100 types, of which more than 40 are spread through all kinds of sexual contact, not just penetrative sex. A couple of types cause genital warts, while a dozen more can cause a range of cancers – head and neck, cervical, penile, anal, vulvar and vaginal among them. The viruses are incredibly common and most people will pick one up at some point in their lives. But the infections themselves don’t tend to cause symptoms, so people are unlikely to know they have the virus. About 90% clear up on their own within two years. The vaccines tend to protect against at least two types of HPV, namely HPV 16 and HPV 18, which between them account for about 70% of cervical cancers. Some vaccines prevent infection from more strains, reducing the risk of cervical and other cancers even more. In September last year the NHS brought in routine HPV vaccination for all 12- and 13-year old boys and girls in year 8. The strategy is to protect children before they become sexually active, and so before they are likely to encounter the virus. As they age and protection becomes more widespread, infection rates should plummet. Hopes for eliminating cervical cancer, or at least reducing cases profoundly, are backed by public health studies, including work by Cancer Council New South Wales. Last year the Australian organisation calculated that high vaccination and screening rates put the country on course to eliminate cervical cancer by 2035, with high-income countries such as the US, UK, Finland and Canada able to reach the same goal between 2055 and 2059. There is devil in the detail, however. The Australians defined cervical cancer elimination as reducing cases below four per 100,000 women, but that threshold is not universally agreed upon. It is not the most pressing concern, either. What matters more for global public health is broader access to vaccines and screening programmes, particularly in poorer countries where 90% of cervical cancer deaths occur. In some richer nations such as Ireland, Denmark and Japan, HPV vaccination rates have been dented by unproven concerns over vaccine safety, often fuelled by anti-vaccine campaigns."
23,cancer,A blood cancer diagnosis helped me find true happiness,"December 2017, and the Christmas party season is in full flow. Everywhere I look are scenes from some hilariously awful Dickens pastiche: revellers squeezed into warm pubs; joyful chatter spilling out on to the street; the sound of carols and the scent of mulled wine in the air. It’s as if I am peering in at it all through frosted glass, wishing my own Christmas could be as carefree. Instead, I have spent a morning turned on my side on a hospital bed while a nervous-looking young doctor works up a sweat attempting to force a long needle into my hipbone. He needs it to go deep enough that he can suck out some of the marrow inside, but my tough bones are making life difficult for him. I don’t feel so tough. My wife and I spend the next fortnight anxiously waiting for the results. Results that should confirm why my body is behaving in unexpected ways: the unusual infections; the crushing fatigue; the old jeans that suddenly slip off my waist. Christmas is never a nice time to feel alone. Yet, despite the fact I am surrounded by loved ones, that is how I feel: terrifyingly alone. The emotions of the season get warped and amplified. I attempt to go to one party, see a friend who is going through her own hellish time, and we both sob on each other’s shoulders for five minutes straight. Everything feels raw and heavy. My little girl is not even 18 months old, and I love her more than anything – but I find it hard to even be in the same room as her. It’s all too much. If Christmas has lost its religious meaning, then it hasn’t for me. I try praying for the first time in about three decades: “Er, yes, it has been a while … sorry about that … but could you just help me out with this one thing?” I promise God and Santa I’ll be all sorts of good if things turn out OK. *** My results arrive on 22 December. There is a wait in a hospital corridor that is still too triggering to think about properly. And then a doctor calls me in, sits me down and tells me that I have a rare blood cancer called essential thrombocythemia, which sounds like some cult artist signed to Warp Records in the 90s (the doctor doesn’t say that bit). There is no known cure. But don’t worry, he says, it’s manageable. I just need to take some aspirin and keep an eye on it. “You will lead a normal life,” he says. My wife tells me my face instantly changed colour, the pallid grey lifting for the first time in weeks.    My little girl throws up all over the seat when we pull out of the drive, and it doesn’t even feel slightly annoying    It’s a strange gift, receiving blood cancer for Christmas. In some ways I preferred the Mr Frosty slushy-making kit I got when I was eight, and maybe even the Scalextric that never quite played out the way you hoped it would from the adverts. And yet what the doctor is telling me – “you will lead a normal life” – feels like the biggest and best present I have ever received. Queueing up to be discharged, I let wave after wave of euphoria run through me and think to myself: “This has to be the weirdest cancer diagnosis ever.” A day later, we pack up the car and head off to my parents. My little girl throws up all over the back seat as soon as we pull out of the drive, and it doesn’t even feel slightly annoying. We laugh. Life is good. That Christmas, for the first time since I can remember, I am truly happy; just living in the moment. The light seems brighter and more beautiful. I notice dew drops on plants and the smell of fresh air. I hug my wife and daughter even more tightly than usual. *** All this relief is not to last long. In the first week of 2018, I attend a follow-up appointment and am told that, sorry, they hadn’t seen all of the bone marrow samples before. My condition is, in fact, developing into a much more serious disease called myelofibrosis, which needs treatment. A week on from that, I turn up at the hospital, steeled to start chemotherapy. But there is worse news: a team of specialists have discussed my case and they believe I am at high risk of developing acute myeloid leukaemia, a swift and deadly cancer. “They recommend you have a stem cell transplant,” says the doctor. I ask when. “As soon as possible.” If I can find a match on the stem cell donor register, then I will be dosed up with drugs so intense that my entire immune system will be wiped out; then a stranger’s cells will be fed into me and we will all cross our fingers and hope that my body doesn’t reject them. The chance of survival and the disease not returning does not seem to me to be all that much better than 50/50. Even if it all succeeds, the recovery process will be long and gruelling. I spend the next few weeks in a state of catatonic depression. Or do I? Because I am somehow getting things done: I organise a will, I arrange a sperm bank visit (the transplant, even if successful, will leave me infertile), I cry myself senseless writing a letter to my daughter in case the worst should happen. I also drink all the good bottles of wine I had been saving for special occasions. A bottle of Domaine Dujac Morey Saint-Denis 2012 on a Tuesday night with defrosted Quorn chilli – not the pairing I’d had in mind, but saving it for the future seems silly. Through all the gloom I see something with startling clarity. I realise that what I’m mourning is not so much my old life before all this started – a life of pointless anxieties, petty rivalries and overthinking – but rather the carefree, optimistic version of life I had briefly glimpsed over Christmas. And yet no sooner have I understood all this than the chance to enact it has been snatched away. I feel like an old professor who has finally unravelled the mysteries of the universe with his dying breath. *** Over the next few months, something happens that I still find hard to believe. I am transferred to a new hospital with a more specialist team on the case. There are more blood tests and scans, and another long needle is forced into my hip. And then I get another gift, this one in time for Christmas 2018: my condition is not so serious as I was led to believe. It appears to be a peculiar version of a peculiar cancer – caught somewhere between the relatively benign essential thrombocythemia and the more concerning myelofibrosis. But it is stable, at least for now, with no signs to suggest it will progress any time soon. *** I like to think that this year I have made good on my promise to live like I did during the Christmas of 2017. My outlook has certainly changed. When people ask how, I always say the same thing: that it’s great to get older. The idea of panicking about a milestone – such as my imminent 40th – seems so ridiculous now. Instead, just think what a privilege it is to be able to get there.     ‘I like to think that this year I have made good on my promise to live like I did during the Christmas of 2017.’ Photograph: Courtesy of Tim Jonze    I am more “present” for my family these days, and less consumed with things I can’t control. I have returned to the volunteering role I thought I didn’t have time for; I have got fit; I don’t let work define my happiness; I am kinder to myself. I have bought lots more nice wine to replace the nice wine I drank with defrosted Quorn chilli. Do I still get annoyed by delayed trains, lost keys or the fact my daughter is taking half an hour to put on a pink tutu, the only item of clothing in the house that she’ll wear? It would be a lie to say no. But the second I think: “But you’re not quite likely to die any more,” the problem disappears. I am, undeniably, a happier person. I still have a malfunction inside me and I still have to think about it every day. It’s hard not to – my spleen, inflated with excess blood cells, gently nudges against my ribs like an annoying acquaintance who would hate me to forget that all is not quite right. At some point in the future – and not even the best doctors can predict exactly when – the disease might whirr into life and start scarring my bone marrow, turning it into a barren wasteland that can no longer produce enough blood to keep me alive. I’m hopeful that science will find a fix before that time comes. There are encouraging signs on the horizon. And if not? Well, these days I try not to dwell on the future. I am here, instead, for the present. I am alive. I am alive with the spirit of Christmas. MPN Voice provides information and emotional support to people diagnosed with a myeloproliferative neoplasm"
24,cancer,Breast cancer and global big pharma,"Anne Boyer’s intense, evocative, terrifying piece about breast cancer (My body feels like it is dying as a side-effect of the drugs that are meant to save me, Journal, 26 September) hit every nerve in me – body and soul – as I have metastatic breast cancer in lungs, liver and brain. (No sympathy needed: currently under control and latterly shrinking.) Boyer is a poet and writes with profound resonance, hitting on abstraction as well as brave, raw fact. She knows pain and she shares it without softening the impact. Her experience of the US medical system comes over as high on sci-fi digital methodology and the cruder slash, burn and poison. It’s all very familiar. But, crucially, what her story evokes is a lack of empathy in a system predicated on profit, in “the capitalist medical universe in which all bodies must orbit around profit at all times”. In the UK, our NHS, whatever its strains, limits and breakdowns, does its best to catch us. I praise to the heavens the dedication of NHS staff at the Royal Marsden (and also at Homerton hospital A&amp;E) who have unerringly treated me with patience, respect and empathy (even when I have been difficult). My treatment has been delivered by people whose medical expertise is underpinned by something that feels, dare I say it, like a kind of love. Boyer’s terrible experience throws into stark context what global big pharma and its political lackeys and lickspittles would like to do to us. If any more of the NHS is sold off US style, our medical world will lose the heart that contributes to keeping so many of us alive.Melanie McFadyeanLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

25,cancer,"NHS lung cancer screening 'could save 5,000 lives a year'","The NHS could save 5,000 lives a year by introducing screening for lung cancer, say experts. Prof Charles Swanton, chief clinician at Cancer Research UK and one of the country’s leading cancer scientists, said: “The data are extraordinary. If we had a drug half as good as that, we would have adopted it by now.” Swanton, whose work is focused on investigating mutations in cells in late-stage tumours that become very hard to treat, urged the introduction of CT screening for people at risk because of smoking or family history, because lung cancer is very curable by surgery if caught early, but often fatal if detected late. Prof David Baldwin from Nottingham, a member of NHS England’s advisory group on lung cancer, backed his call, saying that the NHS had started a pilot programme that he expected would become national. Prof Sir Mike Richards, the former NHS cancer tsar, recently produced a report on the way forward which supported more targeted cancer screening programmes. Most experts emphasise the need to prevent cancer by improving lifestyles, particularly in an era when the NHS is hard-pressed for money, cancer is on the increase and drug treatments for cancers that have spread are increasingly costly. Better diets, not smoking, less alcohol and more exercise are known to reduce people’s risk, but early diagnosis and swift surgery could help to save lives. Baldwin is optimistic that lung cancer survival will increase. “We’re on the brink of real step change in terms of outcomes, I think,” he said. As well as screening, the NHS was speeding up the path from diagnosis to surgery, which would save or extend lives. But inequalities around the country also needed to be tackled. Four times as many patients get surgery in some trusts than others – sometimes because of worries that a frail patient may die in the operating theatre. Lung cancer survival is about 15% in the UK, one of the lowest rates in Europe, with the best in the world – in New York state – at 25%. The experts were speaking before the publication of two reports – one from the UCL School of Pharmacy and the other, from the thinktank Demos, prepared for the drug company Pfizer – which both called for more money for cancer research and treatment. The Demos report calls for the government to raise spending on cancer to the EU average by 2030, which would cost £2.1bn a year. The total economic impact, it says, is far more, at £7.6bn a year. The UCL School of Pharmacy report argues for more spending, including more money for drugs which, it claims, a fifth of the public wrongly think are “bankrupting the NHS”. It argues that about 0.15% of GDP is actually spent on drugs for cancer and that improving outcomes “should be seen as an affordable goal for Brexit Britain even if spending on some treatments rises during the 2020s”."
26,cancer,Louisiana greenlights huge pollution-causing plastics facility in 'Cancer Alley',"The state of Louisiana has issued a series of key air quality permits for a gargantuan proposed petrochemical complex that would roughly double toxic emissions in its local area and, according to environmentalists, become one of the largest plastics pollution-causing facilities in the world. The $9.4bn facility, owned by the Taiwanese chemicals firm Formosa Plastics, would consist of 14 separate plastics plants across 2,300 acres of land in St James parish, a largely African American community in the already heavily polluted area in southern Louisiana known as Cancer Alley.   cancer town box   Activists say the plant could release 13m tonnes of greenhouse gases a year, the equivalent of three coal-fired power plants, and would emit thousands of tonnes of other dangerous pollutants, including up to 15,400 pounds of the cancer causing chemical ethylene oxide. The facility has been forcefully opposed by environmental groups and certain local campaigners. The 16 permits issued by Louisiana’s state environment agency (LDEQ) essentially allow Formosa to begin construction, said the LDEQ spokesman Greg Langley. A spokeswoman for Formosa, which is operating the project under a subsidiary, FG LA, said the company would start “site preparation activities” in the first quarter of 2020. This first phase, including soil testing, could take up to a year to complete, the spokeswoman said. The permits had not been made available to the public by Tuesday afternoon. Langley said this was because of the volume of documents, numbering more than 1,000 pages, which were still uploading to the department’s public website. The announcement was met with derision by local campaigners. “We are fighting to protect our homes and our families from this monster, Formosa. We are not going to stop because of this bad decision by the state to grant air permits,” said Sharon Lavigne, the president of the campaign group Rise St James, in a written statement. Environmental activists on Tuesday indicated they would continue to oppose the project, but withheld details of what their next steps would be until the permits were made publicly available. “The state of Louisiana is wholly unprepared to provide proper oversight of this monster,” said Anne Rolfes, the founding executive director of the environmental organization Louisiana Bucket Brigade. “This approval signals that our state government is willing to sacrifice our health, our clean air and water to cheap plastics. The good news is that we, the people, do not accept this decision. The fight has just begun.” The project has been endorsed by a number of senior state officials in Louisiana, including the governor, John Bel Edwards, citing job creation and tax revenues. It is expected to create 1,200 new permanent jobs with 8,000 temporary construction jobs.   Related: Huge toxic site to be built on grounds where slaves are likely buried, files reveal    “FG is pleased to have completed the rigorous environmental permitting process,” said Janile Parks, the director of community and government Relations at FG LA. “Our team has worked diligently to design a facility that meets state and federal standards that protect the health and safety of our employees, community and the environment.” Parks said that project would generate $362m in taxes for state and local governments during construction, with about $207m being “collected in the St James area”. But local campaigners argue that the financial rewards should be seen as secondary to the project’s environmental impact. At the end of last year, in addition to environmental and health concerns, it was revealed that the complex would be built over two suspected slave burial grounds. The news left residents in the mostly African American neighbourhoods surrounding the sites furious that the information had not been publicly disclosed to them during the application phase of the project."
27,cancer,Woman’s vital cancer treatment delayed over £150k NHS charge," An elderly woman suffering from two forms of cancer had vital NHS treatment delayed for months because she couldn’t afford a £150,000 upfront charge, the Observer can reveal. The case highlights not just the impact of the government’s upfront charging regime – introduced in 2017 as part of its “hostile environment” towards immigrants – but also the failure of changes to the guidance given to hospitals that were announced in response to previous controversies. The patient’s family and doctor both appealed for help to her local MP – the health secretary Matthew Hancock. But even though Hancock was presented with clear signs that his own rules were not being followed, there is no evidence he intervened to ensure that the urgent treatment was provided. The patient, whom the Observer is not naming at her family’s request, came to Britain from Azerbaijan in June 2018 to visit her adult children.  Later in 2018 she noticed a lump in her right groin, which was diagnosed as a nodal malignant melanoma – an aggressive form of cancer. Subsequent tests showed she also had a separate cancerous growth in her lung. However, the Home Office rejected her application to extend her six-month visa, and as an undocumented migrant, she became eligible for upfront charging. Under NHS rules, “urgent or immediately necessary” care should be provided to chargeable patients even if they cannot pay for it upfront. Her local hospital trust, West Suffolk, repeatedly assessed her treatment as urgent or immediately necessary. But West Suffolk could not provide vital immunotherapy to treat the melanoma, instead referring her to Cambridge University Hospitals (CUH) – which refused to provide it unless she paid £150,000 upfront. This meant that a third hospital trust, Royal Papworth, could not provide the required treatment for her lung cancer. With CUH only providing palliative care, and amid fears her cancer could worsen, both her family and her doctor at Royal Papworth wrote to Hancock in June this year urging him to intervene.   Related: NHS denied treatment for migrants who can't afford upfront charges    The doctor’s letter to Hancock advised him that “with any delays, there is likely to be a spread of her cancer disease, which means treatment would not be possible”. But despite this clear evidence that treatment was urgent, the Department for Health simply recommended the case be discussed by the trust. In August, humanitarian organisation Doctors of the World intervened on the patient’s behalf, but it was not until September, when the patient, now 75, won her appeal against the Home Office for leave to remain in the UK, that the upfront charges were dropped and treatment was finally provided. During these months, the patient only received palliative treatment. Meanwhile, Hancock was telling the parliamentary health select committee and BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire programme that he would look at individual cases where safeguards in the upfront charging regime were not being followed, while defending the overall system. Since October 2017, NHS hospitals in England have been required to seek payment before providing elective care to overseas visitors and migrants ruled ineligible for free healthcare. This has led to cases where patients were wrongly denied treatment. A government review concluded that hospitals should “consider fully when a patient can be reasonably expected to leave the UK”. The official guidance includes case studies where treatment for not just cancer but even bunions is provided because it could not wait until the patient left the UK. In the latter case, the hypothetical patient was an undocumented migrant whose case with the Home Office meant they were unlikely to leave the country within six months. But even though the Azerbaijani woman had been in the UK since June 2018 and was appealing – ultimately successfully – against the Home Office, Cambridge was insisting as late as September 2019 return home for treatment. Once immunotherapy was finally provided, it was unsuccessful – the patient’s cancer had become terminal and spread to other parts of her body. It is not certain if this was caused by the delay to treatment. She is currently receiving end of life treatment to try and extend her life and reduce the pain. CUH and Royal Papworth trusts both indicated they could not comment on individual patient cases. The department for health said it could not comment during the pre-election period. A Conservative spokesperson said: “British taxpayers fund the NHS, and it is only fair that overseas visitors make a contribution too. Money raised from charging overseas visitors is reinvested back into frontline services NHS, to ensure everyone can get the care they need. “There are exemptions in place for vulnerable people, and the guidance is clear that urgent treatment will never be withheld.”  Anna Miller, a policy and advocacy manager at Doctors of the World, said: “This is a tragic example of how the charging rules are causing serious harm to patients in desperate need of medical care, and it is not an isolated case. In the last six months Doctors of the World’s caseworkers have supported 18 people who have had treatment withheld.” “Every child, woman and man in this country should get the medical care they need, or lives are at risk. That is one of the main principles of the NHS, it’s what makes our health system one of the best in the world, and we should be proud of that.” Dr John Chisholm, chair of the BMA Medical Ethics Committee said: “The BMA has been consistently and highly critical of the existing overseas charging regulations, with the impact on vulnerable groups being a particular concern. We believe the regulations must be suspended pending a full, independent review into their impact on individual and public health and whether they are even fit for purpose. “A doctor is first and foremost a caregiver, not a border guard, and none of us should ever be expected to determine whether someone is eligible for urgent care based on their background or status in the UK. We are there to treat people on the basis of their medical need. “The Department of Health and Social Care must also ensure that any new guidance on the present charging system actually reaches and informs the behaviour of hospitals and Overseas Visitors Managers, so that shocking and distressing cases like this do not occur again.”"
28,cancer,More cancer patients turning away from NHS for advice – Macmillan,"Growing numbers of people with cancer are seeking advice from Macmillan Cancer Support because overstretched NHS staff are too busy to answer their questions, the charity says. Patients are having to call its helpline for information and guidance instead of asking doctors and nurses in cancer services, who are often too “rushed off their feet” to have the time needed. Some people are already “at breaking point” by the time they call because they are suffering from anxiety, fear and depression over their diagnosis and what their future holds. “Every day people call our support line because their world has been turned upside down by a cancer diagnosis. Whatever the concern – fear about impending test results, anxiety about how they will tell their children or what their scan outcome means – they just need someone to listen and help them make sense of it all,” said Ellen Lang, a service manager on Macmillan’s support line. “When you only have 10 minutes with your doctor and your nurses are visibly rushed off their feet it’s inevitable that you’ll leave without all the answers you need. This is something we’re hearing from people more often now. “We are able to offer that listening ear and support to those who need it – something we know NHS staff would like to do much more of but just don’t always have the time any more.” By 19 December the charity’s helpline had already helped 65,912 people who between them made 241,234 inquiries. That is up on the 61,701 people it helped in the same period last year and the 58,055 and 55,622 it helped in 2017 and 2016 respectively. The number of people needing emotional support – with anxiety, depression and fear – has risen by 20% in the last year alone, to 8,011. That is the commonest reason for calling and more than those seeking help with issues related to the side-effects of treatment (2,254), pain (882) and tests (1,297). Demand for its advice has prompted Macmillan to expand its helpline service, which usually operates from 8am to 8pm. It is staffed by cancer information nurses and advisers, financial guides, welfare-rights advisers, a work-support team and energy-advice specialists. Staff say that many people who call do so in distress at not having had the time to process information about their condition and prognosis when talking to doctors and nurses. The charity said the growing number of people both being referred for investigation of suspected cancer and diagnosed with the disease is adding to the pressures on NHS cancer staff. Lynda Thomas, the charity’s chief executive, said: “It’s heartrending that so many people call at breaking point, having struggled to find the support they need from their healthcare team who we know are run ragged and doing the best they can. “NHS staff do an extraordinary job faced with huge pressures. But as increased demand for our services shows there simply aren’t enough of them to meet the needs of the growing number of people living with cancer.”   Related: Record numbers of NHS cancer patients face 'agonising wait' to see specialist    NHS England did not respond directly to Macmillan’s findings and instead stressed that cancer patients’ experience was improving in other ways, as is how long they live after diagnosis. In a statement, an NHS spokesperson said: “Most importantly cancer survival is at a record high, and so too patients’ satisfaction with their care, with nine out of 10 patients happy with the support they’ve received, all of which is testament to the hard work and compassion of NHS staff. “This progress has come despite more people than ever getting checked for cancer, with 2.2 million getting tested last year. Our NHS Long Term Plan will ensure that by 2021 every person diagnosed with cancer will have access to personalised care plans, including a needs assessment and health and wellbeing support.”"
29,cancer,Australian cancer clinic forced to make own hand sanitiser amid coronavirus protective equipment shortage,"Frontline staff in some dialysis units and aged care facilities are reporting significant difficulties accessing personal protective equipment, while a cancer treatment centre was forced to produce its own hand sanitiser from donated ingredients after 200 litres “strangely went missing”. Unprecedented demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) and hand sanitiser during the pandemic has caused shortages across the healthcare system, prompting warnings from Catholic Healthcare Australia, the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, the Australian Medical Association and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. On Sunday, the government enacted new regulations banning the export of disposable face masks, gloves, gowns, goggles, alcohol wipes and hand sanitiser. It has also sought to boost supply by opening up the nation’s emergency medical stockpile and increasing domestic production, including through calls for Australian companies to pivot into the production of PPE, and sending in the army to help double the production of local manufacturer Med-Con. Globally, the World Health Organisation has urged nations to boost their domestic PPE production by 40% and lift export restrictions that are interrupting usual supply. But PPE shortages are continuing to be felt to varying degrees in hospitals and clinics, including in some services caring for extremely vulnerable patients. Patrick Beissel, a registered nurse, said medical staff at his dialysis unit in Sydney’s north-west had faced critical shortages of masks. At some points, staff had been forced to either re-use the equipment or go without.   Related: Australia is crying out for clearer messaging on coronavirus, 'rambling' politicians told    Dialysis units treat some of the healthcare system’s most vulnerable patients, who are at “higher risk of severe symptoms and complications from coronavirus”, according to Kidney Health Australia. The leading not-for-profit organisation has advised dialysis patients to continue receiving their treatment amid the Covid-19 pandemic and to contact their dialysis unit to do so as safely as possible. If patients are unwell, particularly with a fever, they are advised to phone their unit and act on the advice of nursing staff. Beissel said his unit generally saw a maximum of about 32 patients a day across two shifts. They had, until recently, had only half a box of surgical masks to share between staff and patients.  Beissel said promises of more stock had not materialised and staff had resorted to scrounging for their own masks. “Our situation is not unique, which makes it even more appalling,” he told the Guardian. “No one as far as I know is wearing a mask full-time. We are also running out of hand sanitiser, aprons and antiseptic wipes, with uncertainty about when or how we will get more.” Beissel said staff at the unit received new surgical masks last week, but not the N95 or the P2 masks recommended by the federal government and NSW Health in certain higher-risk circumstances. The unit is run by Fresenius Medical Care, a multinational giant, and one of the biggest dialysis treatment providers in the country. Fresenius denied any suggestion of PPE shortages in its dialysis units and said it was meeting the government’s guidelines on PPE use. The Health Services Union, which represents aged care workers, said its members were also continuing to report problematic access to PPE. In response to the recent PPE shortages in aged care, the government has opened up a direct line to the federal health department for providers, through which they can request supplies from the national medical stockpile. Requests are being triaged to prioritise PPE for providers who have had a confirmed case of Covid-19. The Health Services Union’s national secretary, Gerard Hayes, said it was crucial that PPE was distributed in a preventative way, rather than simply waiting for a problem to emerge. “Everybody is on the same page here,” Hayes said. “Don’t wait for the issue, you’ve got to prevent it. That’s the only way to resolve the matter in aged care. If they can open up those stockpiles now, and hopefully they have, that will at least stop issues developing.” The Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association’s chief executive, Alison Verhoeven, said there was currently a “high degree of prioritisation” of PPE to critical areas of the healthcare system. The national pandemic plan set out a hierarchy of organisations that could distribute PPE, she said. Hospital access to PPE from the national medical stockpile was requested by the state health departments. General practice and community pharmacy requests were being governed by primary health networks, with GPs given priority, particularly in areas with high rates of chronic disease. Verhoeven told the Guardian that other health businesses, such as dentistry and physiotherapy, were much further down the priority list. “What the government has been doing has been prioritising that to areas which absolutely have to function and can’t function without PPE. “Clearly that’s intensive care, and it is the management of vulnerable patients … dialysis patients, Aboriginal communities, some very vulnerable older people. Managing their care is actually quite tricky without PPE.” The cancer treatment centre Chris O’Brien Lifehouse currently had adequate stocks of PPE but knew it had “greater challenges to face before this is over”, said its chief executive, Eileen Hannagan. The centre was left in a difficult position when 200 litres of its hand sanitiser “strangely went missing” earlier this month. Hannagan said the losses were made up by donations of sanitiser ingredients from across Sydney and interstate, including from universities, gin distilleries, hairdressers and chemists. The centre was now using the donations to produce its own sanitiser. “The challenge is looking after our staff and ensuring they feel safe and supported,” Hannagan said. “We’re balancing their understandable anxiety and fears against the responsible use of PPE for the protection of staff and patients and ensuring supply into the future. We know we have greater challenges to face before this is over.”"
30,cancer,'I need to get as much done as possible – I've had cancer': culture during coronavirus,"George Condo, artist Drawing is a solitary and private experience – but it’s something you elect to be solitary. This is a whole different level of intensity. Knowing that at some point there could be a limited supply of paper, a limited supply of graphite, and also a limited supply of time on this planet … it’s tough. Sometimes I wake up and it takes me 20 minutes to believe this is really happening. Luckily, I’ve got lots of materials, lots of canvases, so I can get on with my work, which has become a lot more introspective. I’ve been working on a series called Drawings for Distanced Figures. They’re very much about the idea of people who have to keep 10 feet apart from one another. But they also express some of the intense emotions we are feeling: being on guard all the time or thinking “oh my God I just stood next to someone for two minutes because I forgot about the situation”. I’m seeking a way to translate these existential thoughts into a visual form. I have a paranoid sense of needing to get as many works done as I possibly can in case I get the virus. I had Legionnaires’ disease five years ago and when I asked a doctor if I could continue as normal he said: “Oh no, you’ll be a very high-risk candidate.” I also had vocal cord cancer three years ago which puts me on an even higher level of risk. I’m becoming like Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator, nothing left but a lightbulb for an eye. At least it’s still blinking! It can be depressing at times. But I’m trying to find some beauty in it one way or the other. I like to think about Henry David Thoreau and what he wrote in his book Walden: “Find your eternity in each moment”. That’s what we all have to do at this point. Liza Lou, artist     Liza Lou’s #apartogether_art on Instagram. Photograph: Courtesy the artist and Lehmann Maupin, New York, Hong Kong, and Seoul    Like a lot of people, I had been cleaning the house like a maniac! I came across my old comfort blanket on a top shelf in my closet. I was immediately struck by having this tattered thing in my hand and the memory of how that felt as a kid. That was the impetus for my project – inviting people to use whatever they had at home to make their own comfort blanket. What could people make not just out of their scrap materials but also out of this moment and the limitations it brings? People have been really creative. One woman whose husband passed away is making her blanket out of his old clothes. I talked to somebody who is a real globetrotter and now he’s suddenly stuck at home – he’s making his blanket from all the tote bags he gets given on his travels.  People have been posting their work at #apartogether_art. The hashtag becomes this living space as people add things and comment on them. Then there’s a website where I’m archiving people’s work. I’m also doing live Instagram stuff every Wednesday at 9am. I’m going to do some virtual studio visits with other artists next. I want to exhibit all the blankets when this is over. It would be very poignant to have them all together and capture the intensity of what this moment felt like. Hofesh Shechter, choreographer I was in the middle of making a new piece for seven dancers. The premiere was supposed to be a month from now at Brighton festival, which has been cancelled, in a double bill with my piece Clowns. Clowns is very violent and nefarious and I wanted to balance that by creating something healing. The conversation in the studio was that the most valuable currency of our time is hope. Once coronavirus started to happen I thought, it’s really important that we continue this now. I’m normally a sceptical person, but the fact my neighbour is putting a note through my door saying: “If you need any help, I’ll be there”, I can feel the kindness of strangers. I’m writing the music for the piece and some of it is done, and some will come as we complete the choreography. This particular piece is trying to create that brotherhood feeling. The current situation might amplify those emotions once we go back to the theatre. The power of being a thousand people in a venue, experiencing something together on a cellular level, a chemical level – not on a screen but sensing the air. After being isolated I hope we will appreciate what a powerful and special thing it is we do.     Hofesh Shechter’s Clowns … watch it online. Photograph: BBC    Tansy Davies, composer The human connection to nature has been a strand of my work for as long as I can remember. Now feels like the moment my life has prepared me for; a time to engage even more directly with the huge loss of our spiritual connection to the natural world and to Earth, our home. The most outlandish future project on my horizon is something I would call a “land opera”: a re-enchantment of the land through song. It would be centred around a community of singers, some professional, some not, and created in collaboration with shamanic practitioners; those who have retained a respect for nature through ancient ritual but recognise that these rituals too need to be remade, so that we all can find a way in to this kind of connection to nature, to Earth and to each other. I don’t know if this work will ever be made but the impulse to create work about healing and reconnection certainly feels more urgent now. Stephen Woolley, film-maker Depending on which TV station, radio show or newspaper I visit I’m either an extra in a George Romero zombie movie, a victim from Soderbergh’s Contagion, or Dickie Attenborough freaking out below deck in In Which We Serve. Nothing feels real. Except stomach clenching paranoia. I’m working from home with my wife, Elizabeth. The phone calls and Zoom meetings and emails cascade with the promise of future productions. As producers we have had two films preparing to shoot this summer and autumn. Who knows how long they will be delayed. Is there anything less socially distancing than the intimacy of filming drama? Yet while cinemas did briefly shut at the start of the Blitz, they then remained open throughout the rest of the war. People needed the comfort of their fellow sufferers and they enjoyed laughing and crying together, often remaining rooted to their seats during air raids.  The idea of solidarity was then a human necessity. I think it remains so today. Despite the online community, real comradeship is one of the few ideas that comforts us through these bleak days. People need to be together and movies have to be about something that creates debate and laughter and sadness in a way that’s both profound and entertaining, to be discussed and shared as a group. If we ever get the privilege to make a film again I hope we are aware of that responsibility of an audience’s need to be liberated from their isolation.     Laughing together … Love Love Love by Mike Bartlett at Lyric Hammersmith. Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian    Rachel O’Riordan, artistic director of Lyric Hammersmith It was four days after press night that we had to close Love, Love, Love [a satirical drama directed by O’Riordan].I’d like to finish its run and convey the message that the show can, and will, go on. We won’t be the same people but I want to convey the message that this was a pause, not an end. The Lyric was originally a music hall. People went to music halls during the war to laugh. In trauma we need to be together and have a release. And we can’t at the moment. Laughing together again, sitting side by side, will be a very powerful thing. Antigone [directed by Roy Alexander Weise, and part of the same season of productions] was in its first day of rehearsals when I had to tell the company we were closing. The Sophoclean drama is all about a world that has been decimated and has to start to rebuild itself. We were working on the translation by Seamus Heaney, who lived through the Troubles and was profoundly affected by the suffering he saw. I feel that when we programme it again, it will be playing to audiences who live in a world that is also trying to rebuild itself, emotionally and economically. It will have added intensity."
31,cancer,DJ Mark Radcliffe gets commemorative bench after cancer recovery,"It is an established way to commemorate the dead: dedicating a bench to a loved one’s memory and placing it in one of their favourite locations. But the BBC DJ Mark Radcliffe has been bestowed the honour in life after a bench bearing his name was installed in the grounds of Manchester University, where he studied in the late 1970s. The inscription reads: “Mark Radcliffe loved sitting here … and still does thanks to advances in cancer research.” It marks the broadcaster’s recovery from cancer after being treated at the Christie hospital in Manchester last year, and is part of the Re-Write Cancer campaign, which aims to raise £20m towards the cost of building a £150m cancer research facility in Manchester. The new building – a joint project between Cancer Research UK, the Christie and the university – will bring together the largest concentration of scientists, doctors and nurses in Europe. Radcliffe, who has shows on Radio 2 and 6 Music, was diagnosed with head and neck cancer at the end of last year, requiring the removal of tumours from his neck and mouth. The illness forced him to spend several months off air. He returned to work in February. Radcliffe said: “After everything the Christie have done for me, it was a no-brainer to do this. I’m very proud to be associated with this campaign so that other people can be as lucky as me and get treated there.” The bench is situated right outside what was once the office of Radcliffe’s father, who was a communications officer at the university. He died last year. “Sitting there I felt like he was looking down on me,” Radcliffe said. More benches should celebrate life, he said. “I get a bit fed up of all those plaques, with people claiming a bench for one person. What about everyone else who sat on it? There’s something a bit selfish about it. “Easy for me to say, I suppose. I did feel self-aggrandised that I’ve left a little bit of myself on the campus of the University of Manchester. But it’s good to celebrate life and it’s quite nice to sit on a bench and be wrapped around by survival.”  The new centre will be built next door to the Christie, on the site of the former Cancer Research Manchester Institute, which was seriously damaged in a fire in 2017. Although much vital research work was salvaged, more than 300 scientists and support staff were displaced and are temporarily relocated 13 miles away at Alderley Park in Cheshire. "
32,cancer,Surreal scenes from Christmas parade in Cancer Alley – in pictures,"The Shell Norco Manufacturing Complex has been operating by the banks of the Mississippi River in southern Louisiana for almost a century. A sprawling set of oil refineries and petrochemical plants that dominate the landscape and pollute the air about 20 miles outside the city of New Orleans. The complex has the capacity to refine 10.1m gallons of crude oil a day and can produce up to 3.33bn pounds of ethylene a year. In 2018 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) accused Shell of violating clean air laws for over a decade and reached a settlement with the corporate giant shortly after. Since 2001 the Norco Civic Association, a community group heavily backed by Shell, has run a Christmas parade that winds through the industrial complex, which sits on the site of old sugarcane fields in the heart of a region known as “Cancer Alley” due to its high levels of industrial pollution.  Photographer Julie Dermansky has been photographing this Christmas Parade for the past four years. To her, “this scene illustrates the disconnect humankind has with the damage they are doing to the environment.” The Civic Association says the parade promotes “unity in the community”. These are some of her images from the surreal scenery.     Beauty Queen in a convertible riding in Norco’s annual Christmas Parade in Norco Louisiana on Dec 6, 2015..

33,cancer,'Electronic nose' could smell breath to warn about higher risk of oesophageal cancer,"An electronic device that “sniffs” breath may offer a new way to identify people with a condition that can lead to cancer of the oesophagus, researchers have revealed. Recent figures suggest there are about 9,000 new cases of oesophageal cancer, or cancer of the food pipe, every year in the UK. According to the charity Cancer Research UK, people diagnosed with Barrett’s oesophagus – a precancerous condition in which cells lining the food pipe change and may grow abnormally – have more than 11 times greater risk of getting a particular type of oesophageal cancer called oesophageal adenocarcinoma compared with the general population. Barrett’s oesophagus often has no symptoms but is more common among those with long-term acid reflux problems, while being male, over the age of 50, and overweight or obese are among the other risk factors. UK figures suggest about 3% to 13% of people with Barrett’s oesophagus will go on to develop oesophageal adenocarcinoma, a type of cancer that is on the rise in western countries. Currently, diagnosis of Barrett’s oesophagus relies on endoscopy – an expensive and invasive technique. Now researchers said they have developed an “electronic nose” that can distinguish between patients with and without Barrett’s oesophagus just by analysing their breath. The team said they hope the non-invasive approach could increase take-up of screening among those at risk of the condition – and hence reduce the number of cases of oesophageal cancer.   Related: Taking aspirin with acid reducers can slow advance of esophogeal cancer    “If you have a test available that is non-invasive and easily [detects] patients at risk of developing oesophageal cancer, then of course the participation rates will be much higher as compared to using upper endoscopy,” said Prof Peter Siersema, co-author of the research from the Radboud Institute for Health Sciences in the Netherlands. “Taking this test takes only five minutes,” he added. Patients thought to have Barrett’s oesophagus could then be referred on for further investigation and treatment. Writing in the journal Gut, Siersema and colleagues reported how they tested their device on 402 patients who were scheduled to undergo an endoscopy. Among these patients, 129 went on to be diagnosed with Barrett’s oesophagus, 141 had gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and 132 had neither problem. Before they underwent an endoscopy, each patient was asked to breath into an “electronic nose”– a device that can detect different volatile molecules. In the breath, such molecules result from processes in the body, however while many of these occur in a healthy individual, some may be linked to particular diseases, either reflecting changes in cells or changes in the local community of microbes caused by a disease. As a result, a particular composition within a breath sample may act as a hallmark of a condition. The team’s portable electronic nose incorporated a type of artificial intelligence to look for these patterns. The team first trained the system on samples from 90% of the patients, allowing it to pick out patterns among the molecules in samples from those with and without Barrett’s oesophagus, before testing the system’s diagnostic prowess on the remaining 10% of samples. This was repeated 10 times. Overall the results reveal that the nose correctly identified patients with Barrett’s oesophagus 91% of the time, while it correctly identified those without the condition 74% of the time. When the test was restricted to only those with either gastro-oesophageal reflux disease or Barrett’s oesophagus, the system was still able to distinguish patients, albeit less accurately. Siersema said the team are now planning to repeat the work in a group of 1,000 patients, which he expects will increase the system’s accuracy. The team hope to subsequently test the device’s predictive powers in further groups, including in a primary care, or GP, setting. Siersema said that if all went well the device might be available to GPs in two to three years. Rebecca Fitzgerald, professor of cancer prevention at the MRC cancer unit at the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study, said the approach merited further research. “It is interesting technology that tackles an important clinical problem – early detection of oesophageal cancer,” she said, although she noted the results suggested there would be a lot of false positives if the electronic nose was applied to a healthy population. “Further refinement and validation will be required but these initial data are encouraging,” she said."
34,cancer,Women can be protected from cervical cancer – so why aren't we doing it?,"For too many women, cervical cancer is a death sentence. But it doesn’t have to be. A life-saving preventative vaccine can dramatically cut cases and put the world on track to eliminate this deadly disease. The UK first began offering a vaccine against HPV – the primary cause of cervical cancer – in 2008. According to a 2018 study by Public Health England, infections of certain cancer-causing types of HPV have since fallen by 86% among 16- to 21-year-old women. A study conducted in Scotland last year found that the vaccine reduced pre-cancerous cervical lesions by up to 90%. But such impact has been largely confined to wealthy countries, where the vaccine is widely available. Today, 90% of all cervical cancer deaths around the world occur in developing countries, many of which have yet to introduce inoculation. Just 21 low-income countries have the vaccine. While demand for the vaccine is high, efforts to roll it out in developing countries have been threatened by a global supply shortage. With limited doses available, millions of women and girls are left without protection against a largely preventable disease, simply because of where they live. Last summer, the UK announced the expansion of their HPV vaccination programme to include boys. Other countries, including the US, Germany and Australia, have implemented similar policies. The US also recommends the vaccine for certain women up to 45. Encouraging more people to get vaccinated is unquestionably a positive thing. But, in the context of a global shortage, expanding the population that receives inoculation could mean girls and women in poorer countries are left behind. It should be noted that vaccinating girls against HPV protects boys too, through herd immunity: when enough girls in a community are protected, the virus can’t spread from person to person and everyone is safeguarded. The effects of the vaccine shortage are compounded by lack of access to timely screening and treatment options in low- and middle-income countries. Reliable preventive care services to spot cancer early, like pap smears and visual inspection with acetic acid, are often unavailable. This can mean that cancer diagnoses are often made too late, if at all. Even when cervical cancer is diagnosed, many areas do not have healthcare facilities with cancer specialists, or the equipment for treatments like radiation and chemotherapy. These services are also expensive, putting them out of reach for many. Without access to the HPV vaccine, girls and women in the regions of highest need are left without any tools to protect themselves. In November, the World Health Organization’s strategic advisory group of immunisation experts recommended that all countries temporarily postpone the implementation of HPV vaccination strategies for boys and older age groups. The expert group also suggested that countries consider adopting a vaccination schedule where the second dose is administered three to five years after the first, as appropriate to the national context. Deferring the second dose for younger girls does not affect the vaccine’s effectiveness and will make more doses available now, when they are urgently needed.   Related: Cervical cancer is an avoidable disease – in theory, at least    Implementing these recommendations and steering vaccine supply toward countries at high risk could save hundreds of thousands of lives. The HPV vaccine shortage has an end in sight – new manufacturers are entering the market and more doses will be available eventually, though probably not until 2024 at the earliest. But millions of girls should not have to wait years to receive the life-saving benefits of HPV vaccination. To create a future where girls and women don’t have to bear the burden of cervical cancer, leaders need to take steps to ensure that the limited doses we have go to the regions where they can save the most lives. Countries must also invest in life-saving services like cervical cancer screening and treatment programmes that can protect women who haven’t received the vaccine. If we take these actions, we’ll be sending a clear message that the lives of girls and women in poorer countries really are equal to those in rich ones.

35,cancer,"10 US oil refineries exceeding limits for cancer-causing benzene, report finds","At least 10 US oil refineries have been emitting cancer-causing benzene above the federal government’s limits, according to a new report from the Environmental Integrity Project. The group reviewed a year of air monitoring data recorded at the fence lines of 114 refineries, as reported to the Environmental Protection Agency. The facilities are not breaking the law, but they are required by EPA to analyze the causes of the emissions and try to reduce them. Eric Schaeffer, the executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, said while some refineries have made improvements, others are still releasing benzene at harmful rates. “Benzene comes with elevated cancer risk but also lots of non-cancer issues that are harder to quantify,” Schaeffer said. People can get sick from low levels in the long term or high levels in the short term. Benzene is just one of multiple dangerous pollutants emitted by refineries – which turn oil into gasoline and other products. Studies have shown the populations living around refineries – often people of color and low-income families – to have worse asthma and other respiratory problems.   embed   Benzene harms cell processes. It can keep bone marrow from producing enough red blood cells and can damage the immune system and increase the risk of infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Over the long term, benzene exposure causes other problems, including cancer, according to the Department of Human Health and Services. The data is being collected and reported for the first time following a 2012 lawsuit by the Environmental Integrity Project and seven community and environment groups. The highest-emitting refinery, the Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery in Pennsylvania, shut down in June after erupting in explosions and fires. It was polluting benzene at five times the government’s limit. Most of the other benzene polluters – six out of the top 10 – are in Texas. The second-worst refinery is the Holly Frontier Navajo refinery in Artesia, New Mexico, where levels were more than three times the EPA’s “action level” of 9 micrograms per cubic meter, which requires companies to address the pollution. The federal agency collects data from a number of air monitors around a plant. It takes the average for each station and then uses the highest of those numbers to determine a refinery’s benzene level. The researchers found concerning spikes outside of the time range they analyzed as well. One monitor in June and July of 2018 detected benzene in a concentration of 1,000 micrograms per cubic meter at the distance of about three football fields from an elementary school. The community within a mile of the Artesia refinery has 3,318 residents, 74% of whom are Hispanic and most of whom live below the poverty line. Schaeffer said the extremely high levels led to public pressure and action from the government. Corey Williams, the policy and research director at Air Alliance Houston, said in many cases people living near the refineries and other industrial facilities know they might be dangerous but haven’t always had proof. “I think it’s something that a lot of people have come to accept as part of living in the energy capital of the world,” Williams said. An EPA spokesperson said that “it is important to note that benzene concentration levels monitored at the perimeter of a refinery do not reflect benzene levels in the community”, and that “the federal action level is intended as a benchmark to flag when emissions are higher than expected, so that facilities can look for the cause and take early action.” “Should exceedances be ongoing, this may be a flag for EPA to do further analyses regarding potential community risk,” the spokesperson said."
36,cancer,NHS 'should not pay' for US surrogacy after cancer misdiagnosis,"The NHS should not have to pay for patients to have surrogate children through commercial agreements in the US, the supreme court has been told in a controversial medical compensation case. Whittington hospital NHS trust in north London has admitted negligently failing to detect signs of cervical cancer for more than four years. That oversight led to the woman, identified only as XX, developing highly invasive malignancy, which required chemo-radiotherapy treatment and left her infertile at the age of 29. She was awarded £580,000 in damages but the high court refused to make further payments to cover the costs of four surrogacies in California because such commercial arrangements are illegal in the UK.  XX, now 36, has said one of her “central ambitions in life” is to have a family and that, despite the “profound, distressing and life-altering injuries” caused by her treatment, her loss of fertility is her “major concern”. Her lawyers have argued that she should be granted the costs of surrogacy in California, where the practice is legal and binding, saying that “in 2019, the civil courts should no longer have any role in censuring a woman’s reproductive choice”. Last December, the court of appeal overturned the high court ruling declaring that the patient was entitled to an additional £560,000 to cover the cost of having children with commercial surrogates in the US. At the supreme court on Monday, the Whittington trust appealed against that decision, maintaining that commercial surrogacy is “contrary to public policy”. The case is the last that Lady Hale, the president of the supreme court, will hear before her retirement next month. Opening the trust’s appeal, Lord Faulks QC said: “This is a very sad case.” XX should not be entitled to “the cost of obtaining a child through surrogacy, whether that should be by way of altruistic or commercial surrogacy in the UK or abroad. “Whatever the view the court takes about altruistic surrogacy, there should be no award of damages for commercial surrogacy since an award would be contrary to public policy.” Faulks said there had not been a significant move towards commercial surrogacy in the UK and that the parliamentary process [as opposed to the courts] was much better suited to any change in the law. In written submissions, XX’s barrister, Christopher Johnston QC, said both his client and anyone involved in the proposed commercial surrogacies would not be transgressing any laws in the UK or California. There had been a significant shift in favour of surrogacy in the approach of parliament, government and society in the past 20 years, he said, and it was almost certain the family courts would facilitate any such surrogacy by granting an order confirming that XX and her partner were the surrogate children’s parents. In those circumstances, Johnston added, “consistency in the application of the law strongly supports rejecting this attempt to censure Ms XX’s reproductive choices and bar her from the full compensation to which she would otherwise be entitled”. She had very limited opportunities to have a baby from her own eggs, with each attempt facing “a significant risk of failure”, he added. Johnston also said that “in the UK, where surrogacy arrangements are unenforceable, there is the additional risk that the surrogate mother would keep Ms XX’s baby”. The supreme court is hearing the case on Monday and Tuesday. It is is expected to reserve judgment until the new year."
37,cancer,Cargo plane pilots could ferry vital stem cells as Covid-19 hits cancer treatment,"Cancer specialists are preparing to use cargo plane pilots instead of couriers to deliver life-saving stem cells to patients in need as global travel bans and border closings have created a “logistical nightmare” for the delivery of bone marrow and organ donations. DKMS, an international bone marrow donor center based in Germany, which helps thousands of patients who need bone marrow and stem cell transplants find donors every year, said it has been scrambling to help at least 113 patients who are awaiting their stem cell transplants in the next two weeks. Dozens more are scheduled for transplants in the next 30 days. In many cases, the patients have already begun a grueling treatment of high-dose chemotherapy and radiation to prepare for their transplants, and will need stem cells from donors to arrive on time. The process of delivering the stem cells has been severely complicated by global travel bans, border closings and quarantine rules that force couriers into isolation for 14 days after they have returned from a high-risk area. DKMS scored a major victory last weekend when its US partner, the National Marrow Donor Program, helped secure a travel waiver from the Centers for Disease Control that will allow couriers who are non-US citizens and non-residents to travel to the US to deliver stem cells collected from European donors. But the group is still beset by other logistical issues and concerns, including questions about whether future planned donations will be hampered by flight cancellations and staffing issues in hospitals overwhelmed by Covid-19 patients. Closed borders within Europe are also creating havoc, with DKMS pointing to one difficult recent case in which stem cells were collected from a donor in Poland, brought to Frankfurt, Germany, and then sent to the US. Travel bans in India and Israel are also a big problem. “One of the problems we have right now is that there are less and less couriers and normal passenger flights will be reduced in the days and weeks,” said Elke Neujahr, the global chief executive of DKMS, who said the group is trying to recruit new couriers. “We think we will run out of regular commercial flights soon.” One possible solution – which Neujahr said will probably be necessary beginning two weeks from now – will be for cargo plane pilots to personally carry the stem cells on their flights so that they can be delivered to medical professionals at airports, and then brought to hospitals. Asked if she believed cargo pilots will be willing to help, since stem cells must be carried in-person, Neujahr said: “I think they will do it, because if they know they can save a life, their willingness will be very, very high.”   Related: Coronavirus map of the US: latest cases state by state    The problems facing DKMS and similar organizations show how the pandemic is affecting every aspect of medical care, including for the most vulnerable cancer patients. While many hospitals are delaying non-emergency treatments and surgeries in the face of the pandemic, the aggressive nature of many blood cancers means that transplants cannot be delayed. Marcel van den Brink, head of the hematological malignancies division at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and international chairman of DKMS, described several big challenges he faced last weekend, from tracking the movements of staff who have come into contact with patients who are positive for Covid-19, to planning for a possible drastic reduction in available doctors and other staff due to illness, which could require pulling doctors from other services to help treat Covid-19 patients. “There is no doubt that cancer care is going to be compromised and Sophie’s Choice-like choices will have to be made. We are doing everything we can now … some folks are saying this might change medicine forever,” he said."
38,cancer,Coroner lists failures in care of nurse who died of cervical cancer,"There were gross failures in the care of a nurse who died from cervical cancer after doctors wrongly told her a smear test and biopsy were normal, a coroner has concluded. The Avon coroner, Maria Voisin, said neglect contributed to the death of 49-year-old Julie O’Connor, who died in a hospice in February last year 12 months after the cancer was finally confirmed. Voisin said: “It is clear there are a number of failures in her care, that her condition should have been known and action should have been taken when it was not.” She spelled out four failures and three gross failures from September 2014 to November 2016. O’Connor repeatedly went to see her GP over a 14-month period complaining of gynaecological problems and was referred three times – twice under the two-week cancer pathway – to Southmead hospital in Bristol for further tests. One expert said O’Connor would have had less than a 1% chance of developing cervical cancer had she received the appropriate treatment when she was wrongly given the all-clear from the smear test in 2014. A second said there was clear evidence of cancer when O’Connor had a biopsy in October 2015 and a third said had O’Connor’s cancer been diagnosed and treated in August 2016 she most likely would have survived for at least five years. The inquest heard that by August 2016 O’Connor had returned to her GP with the same symptoms and was referred back to Southmead. She was seen within two weeks but told her cervix “looked normal”. In November she was still unwell and her GP made a third referral to the specialists, who saw her in February 2017. She was due to undergo further tests at Southmead the following month but decided to see a consultant at a private hospital instead. On examining O’Connor, they immediately suspected cervical cancer, which was later confirmed. Further tests showed signs her cancer had spread and she underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Consultant gynaecologist Prof Robert Hammond said if the smear test had been acted upon, O’Connor would had the affected cells removed – giving her less than 1% chance of developing cervical cancer in the future. Voisin asked Hammond: “Is it fair to say she would not have died in February, if she did?” He replied: “Yes.” During the inquest, O’Connor’s husband, Kevin, 50, who works for the Civil Aviation Authority, expressed concern at her inquest that there could be many other “victims”. He said there were “systemic failures” by North Bristol NHS trust in the care of his wife and raised concerns about the investigations into what went wrong. “I am concerned about the trust’s ability to learn from past mistakes. The root cause analysis does not look at the root underlying cause,” he said. “The root cause analysis does not account for further potential victims. I am extremely concerned that a proper wider independent investigation has not taken place. “This negligence is of serious public concern. There may be other victims who have received false negative pathology reports, and false gynaecology clinician examinations, at the North Bristol NHS trust, who need to be reviewed.” North Bristol NHS Trust deputy medical Director Tim Whittlestone said: “Firstly I would like to repeat on behalf of North Bristol NHS Trust our sincere apology for the mistakes we made in failing to diagnose Julie’s cancer. “I would also like to say how sorry we are to her loving family and friends for causing them pain, distress and loss. “North Bristol has investigated these errors and more importantly that we have learnt lessons from our mistakes. “I would like to reassure patients that as a result of Julie we have improved the way we examine patients and diagnose cervical cancer.”"

40,cancer,"'Holy grail' of cancer cure hides progress made, says charity","The obsession with a cure for cancer as the “holy grail” of research on the disease means the public is unaware of how much progress has been made in allowing sufferers to live longer, a charity has found. The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) said the effect risked creating an overly binary “cure or nothing” approach to cancer that could be unhelpful, not only in masking progress, but to understanding how best to tackle the disease in future. A survey for the organisation found that less than one-third of people think cancer can be controlled long term, despite survival times for those diagnosed doubling in a decade and their quality of life improving. The average patient now lives more than 10 years after diagnosis, turning it into a manageable disease long term. But only 28% of people believe cancers can be controlled long term, and 26% think major progress is being made against the disease, the poll – conducted by YouGov – found. In comparison, 46% of people said they believed heart disease can be managed in the long term and 77% said the same for diabetes. The ICR, a charity and research institute, said focusing exclusively on a cure overlooked the “huge” progress made. The reality for many with advanced cancers is that cures are not yet possible, but “we are doing much better at offering new personalised treatments that can greatly extend lives”, the ICR said. The charity is calling for more attention to be given to cancer’s ability to resist treatment so more people can live longer. One third of people misunderstood the widely used term “all clear” to mean the disease is completely cured, rather than simply undetectable and with the potential to still return, the poll of 2,103 members of public and 366 patients found. Only 60% understood the term “drug resistance” means cancer treatment has stopped working, with many assuming the term related to antibiotic treatment. Fifteen per cent of the public, and 16% of cancer patients, were not aware that cancer can resist treatment and return. The ICR is launching the world’s first “Darwinian” drug discovery programme at its new cancer centre aimed at increasing the proportion of patients whose disease can be controlled long term. A final £14m needs to be raised to finish the Centre of Cancer Drug Discovery, and equip it with the state-of-the-art facilities needed for it ambitious Darwinian drug programme. Scientists who will be working there believe its pioneering approach can deliver long-term control and effective cures for cancer comparable to progress made in HIV. Barbara Ritchie Lines, from Birmingham, underwent eight years of treatment after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005. Her cancer is now undetectable.She said: “When I first got diagnosed, I was told that I had maybe only 12 months – but it’s been 14 years, and here I am. I’m so grateful that I now have all this time to spend with my new grandchildren.” Dr Olivia Rossanese, who will be head of biology at the centre, said: “We believe cancer should no longer be a case of ‘cure or nothing’. At the ICR our aim is to discover many more anti-evolution treatments to overcome drug resistance, so we can not only cure a greater proportion of patients but also to give others with advanced disease the chance of a much longer and better life”. Prof Paul Workman, the ICR chief executive, said: “Overcoming the challenge of cancer evolution and drug resistance is the key to defeating cancer. If we can finish off cancer evolution, we will effectively finish cancer.”"
41,cancer,My cancer recovery was relatively smooth. Why do I feel in limbo?,"In the past few months I have been diagnosed with, treated for and ultimately recovered from breast cancer. At all stages the kindness and professionalism of everyone I was in contact with was impeccable, my partner was emotionally and practically supportive at every step and my recovery has been smooth and relatively swift. However, I cannot help but feel I am now in a sort of limbo, having had a serious disease come and go but not having suffered enough for it to “count”. What can I do to accept and truly own what has happened to me without locking myself in a permanent loop of being a cancer victim as opposed to a cancer survivor? I once knew a reporter who’d filed from Chechnya, Afghanistan, Iraq and Beirut. He felt lucky, as far as things go in these places; nobody he knew died, he never saw an explosion. But long after he came home, he still startled easily, slept badly, felt unstuck from ordinary life. Still, he wouldn’t permit himself to use the label “traumatised”. He had a picture of what trauma looked like and it didn’t match what had happened to him.   Related: I'm 50 and disillusioned about love. How should I be in my next relationship? | Leading questions    Eventually his therapist told him something that I try to remember: trauma is anything that was too much for too long. And for some things, one second is too long. I understand why you feel like you’re in limbo, like you can’t quite say “I understand” to other survivors but people who’ve never had cancer can’t quite understand you. But the trap we can fall into is to think that this comparative ranking of actual experiences is a guide to whether what we feel is legitimate. We get stuck asking whether we’ve got the “right” ratio between the thing we went through and the damage it did. The problem with this question is that it tricks us into focusing only on what actually happened, when in fact events don’t damage us on their own. They enlist accomplices on the way to hurting us, getting help from our fears and memories and the childishly hopeful part of us that thought we’d make it through unscathed. But these look completely different in everyone, so the same event can drop into two different minds and blossom in two completely different ways, like inkdrops in water. There just isn’t a reliable ratio between events and damage, and as long as we ask whether we’ve got the right one, we are asking something we are likely never to know. What we can know, if we let ourselves, is how the things we went through changed us. The task isn’t to evaluate the answer but to learn to spend some time with it – give yourself permission to feel whatever the answer is; you might have changed more than other people, you might have changed less than other people. This is not the kind of answer you can be wrong about. But somewhere coiled inside it we might find that whatever else our trauma does to us, whether it stamps itself on our bodies or wakes us up at night or just makes us grateful that we still get to wake up and see birds, it gives us a kind of gift: a vivid understanding of the fact that most other people, too, have been through something that was too much for too long. ************************************* Ask us a question Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

42,cancer,"Offer cancer screenings during lunch breaks, report urges","People could be offered cancer screenings in their lunch breaks in a bid to reverse the alarming fall in those attending appointments, under plans being considered by NHS bosses. Those invited for screening should be able to go in the evening or at weekends, to stop them having to take time off work, according to a major report ordered by ministers and the NHS. The health service must kickstart a consumer revolution in how people access potentially life-saving tests as part of a package of “urgent action” to arrest a slide in the number of people who turn up to be screened, Prof Sir Mike Richards said. Text messages and social media campaigns should also be used to encourage people to attend, the government’s former cancer tsar added. And while GP surgeries and health centres should be used, other premises near where people live should also be pressed into service, he added. Driving up participation is a priority for the NHS because take-up rates have fallen so dramatically in recent years. For example, just 71% of women in England turn up to their appointment to be screened for cervical cancer – the lowest proportion for 21 years – while a similarly low percentage undergo screenings for breast cancer. Bowel cancer has the lowest take-up rate of all: just 58% of those invited come for their appointment. Richards examined trends in screening attendance for those three cancers as well as diabetic eye disease and the risk of someone suffering an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Those two have higher attendance rates, of 82.7% and 80.5% respectively. “Screening programmes are a vital way for the NHS to save more lives through prevention and earlier diagnosis and currently they save around 10,000 lives every year. That is something to be immensely proud of,” Richards said. “Yet we know that they are far from realising their full potential. People live increasingly busy lives and we need to make it as easy and convenient as possible for people to attend these important appointments,” he added. Screening programmes for a range of conditions collectively invite more than 15 million people a year to attend. But only about 10 million – two in three – turn up for the appointment. The NHS in England has already started to do more to make screening easier for people to undergo by offering lung cancer checks in lorries in supermarket carparks. GP practices in south-west London have found that ringing and sending letters to people who did not attend their bowel cancer screening appointment led to a 12% rise in take-up. Similarly, messages posted on Facebook community groups have helped boost attendance at breast cancer screening appointments in Stoke-on-Trent by 13% since 2015. Setting out detailed plans, Richards added: “The slow decline in the number of people who take up the offer of screening out of those eligible … [which is] particularly evident in the breast and cervical screening programmes … must be reversed.” Cancer charities welcomed the likely overhaul of screening that will now follow. Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, urged ministers to implement Richards’s recommendations in full. “At the heart of this issue are people and their families whose lives can be turned upside down by a cancer diagnosis. Screening and early detection can improve and even save their lives.” Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, said getting more people to turn up would help it achieve its aim of saving 55,000 more people a year from dying of cancer by 2030, by improving early diagnosis. “His sensible recommendations keep all that is good about NHS screening services while rightly setting out a blueprint for more convenient access, upgraded technology and progressively more tailored approaches to early diagnosis.” Robert Music, chief executive of Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust, said: “We have long been calling for more accessible appointments, with women able to book and attend screening at locations other than the GP they are registered with, and are pleased to see this referenced.”"
43,cancer,"Nell Gifford, owner of Giffords Circus, dies of breast cancer","Nell Gifford, the owner and co-founder of the retro-chic Giffords Circus, has died of cancer, it has been announced. She was diagnosed with breast cancer five years ago. After doctors told her earlier this year it had spread and she had a year to live, Gifford continued running between hospital and the circus ring, performing in this year’s summer show on a white horse, with a long blond wig hiding her cropped hair. On Monday, it was announced that Gifford, 46, had died. She leaves twins, Cecil and Red, aged nine, who also often appeared under the Giffords big top. A familiar figure striding around the circus’s headquarters on a farm in Stroud, Gloucestershire, most often in fluorescent orange builders’ trousers and a baggy sweatshirt, or sitting for makeup and hair extensions, Gifford was never one for self-pity. “Cancer is boring,” she would tell visitors. In the circus world, among staff and performers, she inspired loyalty and admiration. The writer and journalist Lucy Cavendish described meeting Gifford 20 years ago, describing her as “majestic, beautiful, slightly terrifying, talented, inspirational”. “I was in awe of her back then and that feeling never left me … she was interesting, fascinating, passionate,” Cavendish wrote on Facebook. “She was magical. She will be much missed but she lives on in every single one of us who ever sat in that big top and glimpsed, even for a nanosecond, the glory of Nell Gifford.” Gifford had undergone several rounds of chemotherapy for breast cancer in the last four years, but told her local paper a few months ago that doctors had given her 12 months to live after discovering it had spread to her bones and lymph nodes. Gifford had four siblings. She was close to her father Rick, a television producer, and her mother Charlotte, who had three children from her first marriage, including Emma Bridgewater, the celebrated pottery maker.  She was no stranger to tragedy. Gifford was 18 and had been offered a place studying English at Oxford when Charlotte, then 52, fell from a horse while hunting and suffered a catastrophic brain injury. She never fully recovered but lived for a further 22 years needing round-the-clock care. “Some people really close to me have never had a family tragedy, they’ve never experienced severe loss when they were young, but that’s just good luck. My sisters and I did. We lost our mum and when something like that happens you realise at what point things can go really wrong in your life,” Gifford told the Guardian two years ago. Gifford took a gap year and ran away to New York, where she joined the circus. After returning to the UK to take up her studies, she then worked in various European circuses before meeting her husband, Toti, a farmer’s son. The couple, who separated several years ago, set up Giffords Circus together. “The circus is my raison d’être, I suppose. This is my job and I feel lucky to have it. The circus is very therapeutic. It’s a community and a really fun way of living,” Gifford said. “The circus has been a great support network, especially when I’ve been ill. When you walk into the tent, you leave your troubles at the door and celebrate. It’s escapist, magical, beautiful, funny.” "
44,cancer,Louisiana's 'Cancer Alley' residents launch march against pollution,"For two straight weeks residents of southern Louisiana, will march, walk and ride between New Orleans and Baton Rouge in an attempt to win political and popular support for a grassroots campaign against toxic pollution in the region. At a launch event in New Orleans on Tuesday, organizers sought to frame the fortnight of sustained activism in the context of a crucial gubernatorial runoff election next month, which will see the conservative Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards face off against Republican Eddie Rispone in a race already being closely observed by the White House.   Related: Japanese owners of plant at heart of US Cancer Town refuse to meet activists    The coalition of activists from the region – known colloquially as “Cancer Alley” due to its high volume of petrochemical plants – urged Edwards in a letter, shared with the Guardian, to assist in their efforts to curb toxic emissions and block the construction of new plants in the region while also assuring the governor of their support next month. “We call on all progressives to unite behind the only candidate that can move this state forward. You can depend on our Movement. We have differences that we will have to settle and work out after the election.” It states. The letter adds: “Black voters need stimulation and understanding that their votes do count in state races and there is infrastructure to solve the myriad of problems we solve.” High turnout in African American communities in Louisiana is pivotal to the Democratic pathway to victory, a feat Bel Edwards pulled off during his first election victory in 2015. The governor campaigned extensively in black communities during the first primary earlier this month but did not win enough of the vote to avoid a runoff election under Louisiana’s “jungle primary” system, which sees candidates of all parties face each other on the initial ballot. Many of the worst-affected communities in the Cancer Alley region are predominantly black, including Reserve in St John the Baptist parish, which has the highest risk of cancer due to airborne toxicity anywhere in America. Reserve is the focus of a year-long Guardian series, Cancer Town. Marchers plan to visit numerous sites over the two-week period, including St John the Baptist parish and neighboring St James parish, and will be joined next week by the national moral revival campaigner the Rev William Barber, who visited Reserve earlier in the year as part of an event co-sponsored by the Guardian.   Related: Cancer town: life in the shadow of a chemical plant - podcast    Last week Democratic presidential frontrunner senator Elizabeth Warren placed Cancer Alley and Reserve at the centre of an ambitious environmental justice platform aimed at addressing the racial inequality associated with toxic pollution in America. But the issue of pollution in the region still fails to galvanize much of the local political scene. Last weekend Larry Sorrapuru, a St John the Baptist councilman and the most vocal local political critic of air pollution issues in the parish, lost his seat following elections. Edwards’ administration also has a mixed record on the issue. The state environment department, LDEQ, has repeatedly sought to downplay community concerns about air pollution, which are centered on emissions from the Pontchartrain Works facility, a synthetic rubber plant that emits the toxin chloroprene –listed as a likely carcinogen by the EPA. Following mounting concern and attention, however, the Edwards administration has committed to conducting a study on cancer prevalence rates in Reserve following the publication of an independent study showing “highly unusual rates” near the plant. “The governor has never communicated with us,” said Bobby Taylor, president of the Concerned Citizens of Saint John. “But we hope they will come in and work with us, be part of the community. “This march is about bringing as much attention as we can to this community and others on the route, because we need to bring more focus to this from local people.” Taylor plans to be present throughout most of the two weeks of activism."
45,cancer,There is hope for a new test to diagnose early-stage lung cancer,"You rightly report that one of the key reasons lung cancer is the biggest cause of cancer deaths in the UK is that up to 56% of lung cancers are only discovered in A&amp;E where patients present with late-stage symptoms, by which point they often have only months to live (Report, 31 January). Every year in the UK around 40,000 people are diagnosed with lung cancer and 35,000 people die – it kills more women, for instance, than breast, cervical and ovarian cancers combined, and is the world’s biggest cancer killer. However, there is hope. We write as the clinical trial manager and a nurse involved in the recently completed Early Detection of Lung Cancer in Scotland trial. This trial undertaken by NHS Tayside, Glasgow and Greater Clyde and Lanarkshire in association with the University of Dundee, involved 12,209 patients and was co-funded by the Scottish Chief Scientist office, the Scottish government and UK biotech company, Oncimmune. Early detection is the key to stop the unacceptably high death rate as early-stage lung cancer has a five-year survival rate of almost 60% – late detected lung cancer has a five-year survival rate of only 3%. We have all been lucky enough to witness first-hand a small number of patients’ lives being saved by ground breaking new British technology. While we are hopeful, further results, analysis and research is needed before the blood test can be considered for wider use by the NHS in the at-risk population.Pauline Armory Registered nurse, MSc, clinical trial managerMaxine Arnott Registered nurse • It is wrong to put the blame of late-stage lung cancer diagnosis on GPs, who overall are doing a good job of referring patients with suspected cancers, with more than 75% of patients who are found to have cancer being referred after just one or two consultations. The symptoms of lung cancer – principally a prolonged cough – are also symptoms of more common, less serious conditions, making the decision to refer a difficult one, as it must be balanced with risks associated with overdiagnosis, and overburdening specialist services. GPs need better access to diagnostic tests in the community and training to use them and interpret the results so that our decision to refer can be as informed as it possibly can be. What GPs don’t need is undue criticism for a situation beyond their control when they are working under intense pressure, without the sufficient time or resources required to provide the holistic care that GPs excel at delivering.Prof Martin MarshallChair of the Royal College of GPs • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

46,cancer,Sharp 80% rise in liver cancer deaths in UK,"Deaths from liver cancer in the UK have shot up in recent years, with a rise of almost 80% in numbers between 2007 to 2017, new figures reveal. Experts say there are several factors behind the rise, including the fact that more people are being diagnosed with the disease, which is notoriously difficult to detect in its early stages, meaning it has a poor prognosis. According to Cancer Research UK, which released the latest figures, if the cancer has progressed to the point that surgery is not an option, survival is often only a matter of months. “A lot of progress has been made saving lives from cancer, but it’s worrying to see deaths from liver cancer increasing at such an alarming rate,” said Michelle Mitchell, chief executive of CRUK, adding that the charity is pursuing research into the biology of the disease to develop better treatments, with immunotherapy one of the options being explored.  The figures reveal that deaths from liver cancer in the UK rose from 3,200 in 2007 to 5,700 in 2017, reflecting the 80% rise. After taking into account changes in the population, an increase in deaths from liver cancer remained, with the rate rising 50%, from 5.9 per 100,000 people in 2005-07 to 8.9 per 100,000 in 2015-17.   chart   There was also a 60% increase in the rate of people diagnosed with the disease in the same time period. A number of factors are linked to a higher risk of liver cancer, including older age, having HIV or Aids, having a family history of the disease, and also ethnicity, with liver cancer being more common in black and Asian people. However the CRUK team say the increase in cases of liver cancer was probably down to, at least in part, a rise in obesity and associated health conditions. It is estimated that just under a quarter of all cases of liver cancer are linked to being overweight or obese. Overall, half of all liver cancer cases are thought to be preventable, with smoking, drug abuse and drinking alcohol among the risk factors for the disease.   Related: Offer cancer screenings during lunch breaks, report urges    A separate analysis of data for England by the National Cancer Research Institute, confirmed that liver cancer was a growing problem, revealing that the rate of new cases of the most common type, as well as deaths from it, tripled between 1997 and 2016. For men, deaths from this type of the disease rose from 1.93 per 100,000 people to 5.97 per 100,000 people in that period, while for women deaths rose from 0.51 per 100,000 people to 1.4 per 100,000 people. Experts say the steep rise in this particular form of liver cancer, known as hepatocellular carcinoma, might in part be down to improvements in diagnosing individual types of cancer. The team also found that this form of liver cancer was particularly common among more deprived members of society, with a quarter of cases in the bottom fifth of the population for deprivation. Mitchell added that the rise in deaths looks set to continue, with the number of people diagnosed with liver cancer expected to rise by 38% between 2014 and 2035. Hassan Malik, a consultant hepatobiliary surgeon at University Hospital Aintree, said the new figures should be a call to policymakers to focus on prevention and treatment of liver cancer. “Prevention is always better than cure, and this is particularly the case for liver cancer, which is usually only detected in its advanced stages when it is almost impossible to cure,” he said."
47,cancer,Revealed: Denka lobbied to undermine science behind ‘likely’ cancer-causing toxin,"Facing public pressure to rein in its pollution, a Japanese chemical manufacturer has instead launched an aggressive, years-long campaign to undermine the science showing that its compounds could cause cancer, according to newly released documents reviewed by the Guardian. Chloroprene, the primary constituent of the synthetic rubber neoprene, is the major air pollutant in the town of Reserve, Louisiana, an area which according to the Environment Protection Agency has the highest risk of cancer due to airborne toxins anywhere in the US. The town, and the chemicals plant operated by Denka Performance Elastomer, is the subject of a year-long Guardian reporting project, Cancer Town.   series box   Robert Taylor, director of the Concerned Citizens of St John – the community group leading the fight for clean air in the town – said a reversal of the EPA classification would be “devastating” for his fellow residents. “I think it’s very audacious of them to challenge all of this work that the government has done. To me it’s indicative of how callous these people are and how they really just don’t care about the people here,” Taylor, who has numerous relatives that have died of cancer he blames on the plant, said. “If they are successful it would leave us at the mercy of this plant.” In 2010, the EPA concluded an extensive, independent, peer-reviewed assessment of chloroprene which found that the compound was “likely to be carcinogenic to humans”. The federal government has recommended a maximum level of chloroprene humans should inhale over a lifetime as 0.2 micrograms a cubic metre. The agency, however, doesn’t enforce its guidelines. For years Denka has been quietly fighting to discount the underlying science that proves chloroprene is a dangerous carcinogen even in low amounts. Denka argues that lifetime chloroprene exposure levels could be 156 times higher than what the EPA has determined and that the chemical shouldn’t be considered a likely carcinogen. A series of documents, shared with the Guardian and released to lawyers for Reserve residents under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), shows the company and its contractors have pursued EPA scientists and pushed them to accept their own new modeling, which Denka has offered multiple new peer-reviewed studies to try to bolster. Emails show EPA officials resisting Denka’s efforts. A spokesman for Denka said the company is “dedicated to sound science” and stated it has “worked collaboratively with EPA to seek EPA’s reconsideration of the faulty science” underlying the 2010 classification. The plant, named the Pontchartrain Works facility, was built by the US chemicals giant DuPont in the mid-1960s, and began producing neoprene in 1968. DuPont sold the facility to Denka in 2015, shortly before the EPA found that a census tract next door to the plant had a cancer risk rate 5o times the national average. Denka’s campaign began shortly after Donald Trump won election and just days before he took office, with an “urgent” memo to the presidential transition team on 17 January 2017, accusing EPA of “using faulty and highly inflated risk data”. The company said the EPA’s findings about the dangers of chloroprene would hurt its bottom line, according to another set of public records obtained by the Sierra Club under the FOIA. “These studies will result in unwarranted compliance costs that pose a direct threat to [Denka’s] ability to keep its facility open and to keep jobs in Louisiana,” Denka said.   Related: 'It’s been killing us for 50 years': residents on living in Cancer Town    A Denka spokesman pointed to the $35m spent by the company to install emissions controls in recent years. The company said these installations have reduced chloroprene emissions by 86%, but it has been challenged on this claim by the Louisiana department of environmental quality (LDEQ). The plant continues to emit chloroprene above the 0.2 EPA guideline, according to the agency. Emails show lawyers working for Denka repeatedly seeking meetings with top EPA officials throughout 2017. In September 2017, Ramboll Environ, Denka’s consultants, testified at a Republican-run House hearing to criticize the chloroprene review as bad science. Denka’s crusade continued through 2019, new records reviewed by the Guardian show. Ken McQueen, EPA’s regional administrator over Louisiana, met with the company as recently as 30 October. A Denka spokesman said the purpose of this meeting was “to introduce plant management and executives” to EPA officials and that meeting included a short update on Denka’s request for reconsideration of the agency’s chloroprene findings. Emails earlier this year show EPA officials repeatedly pushing back on Denka’s campaign, arguing that the new studies Denka presented weren’t enough and that the full model would have to undergo internal peer review at the agency. The EPA has since paused its reconsideration of chloroprene until that peer review is complete, the agency confirmed by providing the Guardian with a letter written from the air quality planning director, Peter Tsirigotis, to Louisiana’s environment secretary, Chuck Carr Brown, on 23 September. Tsirigotis noted that EPA’s chloroprene review is not an air quality standard and is not used directly to regulate plants. “Risk is one factor that we need to consider, along with information on costs, energy, safety, control technologies and other relevant factors,” Tsirigotis said. ••• Emails show the EPA’s Tina Bahadori, who was at the time director of the National Center for Environmental Assessment, insisting that Denka’s model be further analyzed by the agency. On 6 June, she explained that Denka’s physiologically-based pharmacokinetic, or PBPK model – must pass peer review before it could factor into any of EPA’s decisions. A PBPK model is a technique for predicting how a human or animal will absorb and metabolize a chemical. “I want to emphasize … the focus of this engagement is on the model and its acceptability in the context of this request for reconsideration,” Bahadori told Harvey Clewell, the principal consultant at Ramboll Environ. “We are not having a discussion about the risk calculations.” Clewell – who has also conducted tobacco industry-funded studies with his models - pushed back in two more emails, asking if protocol had changed. “No, nothing has changed,” Bahadori said.  Clewell declined to answer specific questions from the Guardian, citing “client confidentiality”, but stated that company’s work for Denka “meets the highest scientific, professional and ethical standard”. “We are confident that the ongoing EPA quality assurance review and upcoming EPA peer review of the chloroprene PBPK model will find our methodology and conclusions to be scientifically valid, he said on behalf of the company. A Denka spokesman said the company believes “a robust and thorough peer review process is the best way to reach a sound scientific consensus”. Experts who have reviewed the situation say that if Denka is successful in its appeal, it could have license to release even more chloroprene into the air in Reserve, avoiding possible future regulations. Denka is already facing a civil suit in the state courts involving dozens of local plaintiffs under nuisance abatement laws. The decision on chloroprene could also set a precedent for other chemical manufacturers to seek reviews to the science that has deemed their products unsafe. Penny Fenner-Crisp, the former deputy director and senior advisor for EPA’s pesticide program who is now retired, said the type of model Denka is backing is also under discussion in evaluations of two industrial solvents that make people ill, methylene chloride and NMP. “It’s a big deal. I think it’s an appropriate big deal because it is providing a tool to better understand at least partially the similarities and differences between the test animals and people,” Fenner-Crisp said. But Sonya Lunder, a senior toxics adviser Sierra Club, said Denka’s fight for lax guidance on chloroprene fits a broader trend of industry trying to delay, complicate and control the regulatory process. “I think industry knows that these numbers have an incredibly powerful impact, or can, on downstream regulation,” she said."
48,cancer,Ex-Labour MP had breast cancer surgery days before losing seat,"The former Labour MP for Kensington has revealed she underwent treatment for breast cancer days before narrowly losing her seat to the Conservatives in the general election. Emma Dent Coad told the BBC she received the diagnosis after a routine screening on 14 November and underwent a procedure to remove the cancer three days before polling day. The 65-year-old, who is still a Labour councillor in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, said she decided not to share the diagnosis with the public, because she didn’t want it to become an issue in the campaign. Dent Coad was elected as the seat’s first Labour MP in 2017, a week before 72 people were killed in the fire at Grenfell Tower in the constituency. She lost the seat by 150 votes in last week’s general election. “I was very lucky, it was picked up very early after a screening. It was pre-lump stage,” she told the the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire. “I always knew it was a possibility. I have four sisters, two of them have been through it and survived […] I was hoping I had got away with it. “I’m OK, actually, because I’m going through the process and I feel quite positive about it. But it was a horrible shock at a really terrible time.” Dent Coad said part of the reason she had decided not to make her diagnosis public was because she and her family needed time to deal with the news. “[It was also] partly because I just didn’t want it to be a factor, at all, either positive or negative, in my campaign,” she said. “I didn’t want it to be an issue at all, so we had organised everything beautifully and I just stepped out when I had to and the machine of the campaign continued around me, and [I pay] tribute to those people who did that.” Speaking earlier this week, Dent Coad said part of the reason she lost her seat was because of claims by remain-supporting advocates of tactical voting that her Lib Dem rival, Sam Gyimah, was the most likely candidate to beat the Tories. “People believed it,” she said. “Some of my own friends did, they voted Liberal Democrat. They said: ‘I’m really sorry Emma, but I’ve seen the polling. You can’t win.’ And I lost by 150. Only 76 people needed to think: ‘Give us a break’ and I would have been back in.”"
49,cancer,"Pain, cancer, death: Michigan families devastated by toxic chemicals in their water","In the years before 2017, Sandy Wynn-Stelt and her husband had suspicions about the water they drew from a well on their House Street property in the Michigan town of Belmont. She attributed the bad taste to it being well water, but the “weird film” on their morning coffee was difficult to explain. By June 2017, state officials alerted her that PFAS from a nearby, decades-old dump belonging to Wolverine World Wide, a shoe giant best known for the Hush Puppy brand, had contaminated their well.   Related: Why you need to know about PFAS, the chemicals in pizza boxes and rainwear    Tests found shocking levels. The Environmental Protection Agency’s PFAS advisory water limit is 70 parts per trillion (ppt). Health officials found levels in the well as high as 90,000 ppt. Wynn-Stelt told the Guardian she now suspects the PFAS-laden product Wolverine uses to make its shoes water and stain resistant was behind that weird film. “I now know it was probably Scotchgard,” she said.  Wynn-Stelt and her neighbors in this small west Michigan community are among the PFAS crisis’s human toll – those suffering the horrors that await humans with too much of the toxic chemical in their bodies. PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 5,000 fluorinated compounds dubbed “forever chemicals” because they don’t naturally break down and there’s no known way to destroy them. They’re found in everything from food packaging to clothing to eyeliner to firefighting foam. The chemicals are also strongly linked to cancer, low birth weight, autoimmune disorders, thyroid issues, and a range of other serious diseases. By the time Wynn-Stelt learned of the contamination, it was too late. She and her husband, Joe Stelt, had been drinking dangerous levels of PFAS for years, and Stelt had died from liver cancer in March 2016. The level of PFAS in Wynn-Stelt’s blood soared to 750 times that of the national average. She now suffers from recurrent thyroid problems and developed gout, and more serious issues are likely. She has been left “scared to death” and overwhelmed. “I’m sitting here full of this stuff and not knowing what it’s going to do to me five years, 10 years from now,” she said. “I lost my husband, my home is worth nothing. I couldn’t give it away this close to a toxic dump … or after they dumped toxic waste on my land.”  As the chemicals gather around the planet, public health officials have found more than 700 contaminated sites and waterways around the country, and the PFAS crisis’s breadth is coming into focus. Researchers recently identified dangerous levels in rain, and areas around military bases are regularly contaminated. By some estimates, 21 million Americans are drinking PFAS-contaminated water – in the fall, an environmental group found the chemicals in California and Kentucky’s water supplies.    I’m sitting here full of this stuff and not knowing what it’s going to do to me five years, 10 years from now  Sandy Wynn-Stelt     However, no state has more contaminated sites than Michigan, although officials say that’s because the state is conducting more tests to look for PFAS. Biosolids contaminated with it were discovered two years ago in Lapeer, where a chrome plating facility discharged the chemicals into the Flint River. A few hours north in Oscoda, the air force is refusing to clean up contamination from a shuttered base, while officials have found contaminated wells at schools and daycare centers across the state. Still, PFAS production and use is unabated in the state as Republicans in Michigan, Congress and the White House have successfully blocked stricter regulations. Meanwhile, those living with the contamination call life an “absolute nightmare”. Wynn-Stelt said neighbors have faced cancer, miscarriages, autoimmune disorders and other health issues. That includes Jen Carney, whose children, ages 15 and 11, are among 22 kids living near the House Street dump. The family’s well tested as high as 600 ppt while a neighbors’ hit 11,000 ppt. The Carneys all have elevated PFAS levels in their blood, and in the years before the revelation, Carney and neighbors suffered from unexplained twitching, eye pain, migraines, distorted vision and numb arms and legs. “I was, at the time, 38, and I was thinking, ‘Oh my God, I’m going to be in a wheelchair soon,’” Carney said. Once the family switched from PFAS-contaminated water to clean water, the issues vanished. Carney’s son, however, hasn’t been so fortunate. He endures severe gastrointestinal problems that forced him to miss so much school that Carney now homeschools him. She said she hopes time will alleviate his symptoms. Though it’s evident to families in the area that PFAS are behind their ailments, the chemicals haven’t been medically proven to cause them, so their illnesses can’t be used in the lawsuit that local families have filed against Wolverine.     PFAS-laden animal hides camouflaged with moss near Meaghan Schweinzger’s home. Photograph: Courtesy Meaghan Schweinzger    “I know in my heart that it’s connected, and my primary care doctor believes it’s connected, but we have to have it scientifically connected,” Carney said. “Unfortunately, until we do that, we can’t hold the polluters accountable.” The 76-acre House Street landfill most recently served as a Christmas tree farm, and neighborhood residents didn’t know Wolverine had previously used it to dump toxic animal hides treated with 3M’s Scotchgard at its tannery in nearby Rockford.  The chemicals not only flowed a few hundred feet to House Street’s wells, but far beyond. That plume and six others from nearby Wolverine landfills now stretch 25 miles and have carried PFAS to the state’s waterways. The EPA, state and Wolverine are undertaking a massive cleanup effort. So far, the company has installed about 700 whole-home filters and excavated tons of soil in the area. As part of a settlement in a lawsuit stemming from the pollution, Wolverine will pay $69.5m to extend municipal water service to those around House Street who have private wells. “Wolverine will also continue the cleanup and remediation efforts it began [last] fall around its former tannery and House Street sites in cooperation with the EPA,” the company said in a statement. It’s also suing 3M for allegedly concealing Scotchgard’s dangers from it and other customers.   Related: A trail of toxicity: the US military bases making people sick    The cleanup effort extends to areas outside Wolverine’s former landfill where residents say it was also dumped. House Street resident Meaghan Schweinzger’s kids used to camp out, sled, and have bonfires in a clearing at the edge of the woods behind their home. In 2017, Schweinzger was horrified to discover that Wolverine had also left barrels full of toxic waste and PFAS-laden animal hides now camouflaged with moss in the brush just a few feet from where her kids played. Schweinzger, Wynn-Stelt, and others aren’t taking it lying down. They’ve appeared in front of the Michigan legislature, Congress, and spoken at a number of conferences and events to help put a face on the crisis and share the distressing uncertainty. Wynn-Stelt said she thinks at night about Joel Stelt’s bout with cancer, and how she faces what could be a difficult illness without him. “To know how painful that was for him, and how I literally had to carry him to the bathroom, and how I couldn’t leave his side – it was horrible to watch, and now I think, ‘Who’s going to do that for me’”? she said. * This article was amended on 22 January 2020 to clarify a reference to dumping and to include Wolverine’s stance on no deaths being proven to be linked to PFAS from the site."
50,cancer,Air pollution nanoparticles linked to brain cancer for first time,"New research has linked air pollution nanoparticles to brain cancer for the first time. 
The ultra-fine particles (UFPs) are produced by fuel burning, particularly in diesel vehicles, and higher exposures significantly increase people’s chances of getting the deadly cancer. Previous work has shown that nanoparticles can get into the brain and that they can carry carcinogenic chemicals. 
Brain cancers are rare, and the scientists have calculated that an increase in pollution exposure roughly equivalent to moving from a quiet city street to a busy one leads to one extra case of brain cancer for every 100,000 people exposed. 
“Environmental risks like air pollution are not large in magnitude – their importance comes because everyone in the population is exposed,” said Scott Weichenthal, at McGill University in Canada, who led the study. “So when you multiply these small risks by lots of people, all of sudden there can be lots of cases. In a large city, it could be a meaningful number, particularly given the fact that these tumours are often fatal.” 
The research analysed the medical records and pollution exposure of 1.9 million adult Canadians from 1991 to 2016. Such large studies provide strong evidence, though not a causal link. Weichenthal said the correlation seen between brain cancer and nanoparticles was “surprisingly consistent”, but as this is the first study, it is important that other researchers replicate it. 
The discovery of abundant toxic nanoparticles from air pollution in human brains was made in 2016. A comprehensive global review earlier in 2019 concluded that air pollution may be damaging every organ and virtually every cell in the human body. 
Toxic air has been linked to other effects on the brain, including huge reductions in intelligence, dementia and mental health problems in both adults and children. The World Health Organization says air pollution is a “silent public health emergency”. 
The new study, published in the journal Epidemiology, found that a one-year increase in pollution exposure of 10,000 nanoparticles per cubic centimetre – the approximate difference between quiet and busy city streets – increased the risk of brain cancer by more than 10%. 
The pollution levels in the cities studied – Toronto and Montreal – ranged from 6,000/cm3 to 97,000/cm3. Weichenthal said people living with pollution of 50,000/cm3 have a 50% higher risk of brain cancer than those living with 15,000/cm3. 
“I think [Toronto and Montreal] are typical of major cities,” he said. “I wouldn’t expect the nanoparticles to be any less harmful anywhere else.” The analysis by the researchers took account of factors including income, smoking and obesity, and whether people moved house. 
“We don’t know a lot about the causes of brain tumours, so any environmental factors we can identify are helpful in increasing understanding,” Weichenthal said. The team only had air pollution data for the more recent period of the study and assumed the differences between different streets and districts were the same in the past. “We think this is reasonable because major highways don’t move around,” he said.

Prof Jordi Sunyer, at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health in Spain, who was not involved in the new research, said: “This is an important finding, given that UFPs are directly emitted by combustion cars and several studies in animals have shown UFPs could be more toxic than larger particles.” 
Prof Barbara Maher, at the University of Lancaster, UK, said iron-rich nanoparticles from traffic pollution were likely to be carcinogenic and were therefore a plausible possible cause of brain cancer. She said nanoparticles were not regulated and were rarely even measured. 
 
  
  
   
    
    Air pollution has been described as the ‘new tobacco’ by the head of the World Health Organization. Over 90% of the world’s population suffers toxic air and research is increasingly revealing the profound impacts on the health of people, especially children.
    Children and babies’ developing bodies are most at risk from toxic air, with 300 million living in places where toxic fumes are six times above the international guidelines.&nbsp;
    A comprehensive global review found that air pollution may be damaging every organ and virtually every cell in the human body. It causes issues from heart and lung disease to diabetes and dementia, and from liver problems and bladder cancer to brittle bones and damaged skin. The systemic damage is the result of pollutants causing inflammation that then floods through the body, and from ultrafine particles being carried around the body by the bloodstream. A Canadian study recently linked air pollution nanoparticles to brain cancer for first time
    In the UK, while deaths attributed to air pollution have halved in the last four decades, most urban areas have illegal levels of air pollution. One in 20 deaths in the UK is still attributable to small particle pollution alone.

The research used three-year averages of nanoparticle levels, but Maher said understanding the health impact of repeated exposure to short-lived spikes was vital: “We have measured these outside primary schools in the UK, where UFP particle numbers regularly exceed 150,000 per cubic centimetre of playground air.” 
Weichenthal said he avoided heavily polluted streets when walking and cycling. “At an individual level, it is always a good idea to reduce your exposure to pollutants. But the more important actions are at a regulatory level, where you can take action that reduces everyone’s exposure – that is where the real benefits come in.”"
51,cancer,Civil rights leader John Lewis says he has stage 4 pancreatic cancer,"Congressman John Lewis, the civil rights leader and Democrat representative for Georgia, is receiving treatment for stage 4 pancreatic cancer, his office has said. “I have been in some kind of fight – for freedom, equality, basic human rights – for nearly my entire life. I have never faced a fight quite like the one I have now,” Lewis, 79, said in a statement released on Sunday evening. “This month, in a routine medical visit and subsequent tests, doctors discovered Stage IV pancreatic cancer. This diagnosis has been reconfirmed,” he said. “While I am clear-eyed about the prognosis, doctors have told me that recent medical advances have made this type of cancer treatable in many cases, that treatment options are no longer as debilitating as they once were, and that I have a fighting chance,” he added Lewis is the only surviving speaker from the 1963 March on Washington, the landmark protest that culminated in Martin Luther King’s famous “I have a dream” speech. He has represented Georgia’s 5th Congressional District, which includes much of Atlanta, since first being elected in 1986. Lewis said he planned to return to Washington in the coming days while he begins his treatment. “I may miss a few votes during this period, but with God’s grace I will be back on the front lines soon. Please keep me in your prayers as I begin this journey,” he added."
52,cancer,Tackling ovarian cancer: explaining the disease and potential treatments,"Ovarian cancer may be the cancer that women fear the most. In 2018, nearly 300,000 women around the world were diagnosed with ovarian cancer and approximately 180,000 women died as a result of the disease. In England, approximately 6,780 women are diagnosed each year. According to the World Ovarian Cancer Coalition, only 45% of women with ovarian cancer live for five years after diagnosis, as compared with 89% of women with breast cancer. So what is being done to improve these figures? Rebecca Rennison, director of public affairs and services at Target Ovarian Cancer, explains that women in the UK have often been diagnosed too late for effective treatment because they, and their doctors, do not recognise the symptoms of ovarian cancer. Symptoms can be difficult to recognise. Some, such as persistent bloating, stomach pain, urinary symptoms, loss of appetite and change in bowel habits, may be confused with other conditions. About 41% of women visit their GPs three times or more before being referred for tests, and 45% wait more than three months to receive their diagnosis. “You need a system that diagnoses a woman with ovarian cancer promptly,” she says. The earlier a woman with ovarian cancer is diagnosed, the better the prognosis is likely to be. There has been a lot of progress in recent years – 58% of women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed following a referral from their GP, compared with 47% just over 10 years ago. However, many women are still only diagnosed after emergency treatment at A&amp;E. And for women with advanced ovarian cancer, the disease will recur in approximately 75% of cases. As a result, there is still a high unmet need – many women with ovarian cancer are often diagnosed with advanced stage disease where effective treatments are limited; the disease may not progress from stage 1 to stage 2 to stage 3-4 but may start in the fallopian tube and spread to the abdominal cavity were it is already a stage 3.     Early diagnosis of ovarian cancer is often difficult because symptoms such as persistent bloating and stomach pain can be confused with other conditions. Photograph: KatarzynaBialasiewicz/Getty Images/iStockphoto    Treatment commonly involves surgery and chemotherapy. Radiation therapy is rarely used for the treatment of ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. However, it may be used selectively to treat some women with clear cell ovarian cancer after chemotherapy. Occasionally, it can be an option for treating small, localised recurrent cancer. Over the past few years, some women have also been given drugs called Parp inhibitors after their chemotherapy as a maintenance therapy, but they have not been prescribed for the majority of patients. Parp (poly-ADP ribose polymerase) is a protein within our cells that helps damaged cells repair themselves. Parp inhibitors work to prevent Parp from repairing cancerous cells, which may lead to those cells dying. These inhibitors are given to some women as maintenance therapy after a course of chemotherapy to delay the time before a potential recurrence. But only a minority of patients have been eligible to take them as initial therapy, mainly the 15% of women who have a gene mutation called BRCA. According to Axel Hoos, senior vice president, R&amp;D and therapeutic area head of oncology at GSK: “[The use of Parp inhibitors] is highly targeted treatment and the effect in the right patient population can be substantial.” However, until recently, consideration had not been given to whether people without BRCA mutations would still be likely to respond to the treatment; cancer cells with no BRCA gene mutations already have poor repair systems. “Not enough attention had been given to people without genetic anomalies, or no detectable anomalies, to see if they were still prone to respond [to Parp inhibitors],” Hoos emphasises. A few years ago, only about 15% of patients – those with BRCA mutations – had been considered eligible for Parp inhibitors.   Related: Asthma inhalers: what next for the drug delivery tech that dates back to 1778?    Additional options in ovarian cancer treatment have made Rennison hopeful. “We have seen the new generation of Parp inhibitors coming through, which is really exciting,” she says. It is already clear that women with ovarian cancer are benefiting from Parp inhibitors as maintenance therapy after chemotherapy. “Many will still experience progression in their disease but obviously the longer women are surviving the better,” Rennison continues. “There have been great advances but we wouldn’t be doing our jobs if we didn’t say there is still a huge amount to be done.” In the future, Parp inhibitors may be able to be approved for use in the treatment of other cancers. “Further research could open the door for [diseases] such as lung, breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers,” explains Hoos. Hoos previously worked in other areas of oncology, specifically with immunotherapy. “This is an expanding area of science that can provide dramatic benefits to patients,” says Hoos. “There is no better time to work in oncology than today. There is so much more we can do as researchers that can help patients with cancer.”"
53,cancer,Cervical cancer self-tests may be key smear alternative – study,"Swabs or urine samples taken at home could be as effective at identifying women at high risk of cervical cancer as traditional smear tests, according to new research. Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women globally. In the UK, women aged between 25 and 64 are invited for cervical screening every three years. While cervical screening can save lives, many women find having a clinician take a swab of their cervix unpleasant, embarrassing or are worried it will hurt, with recent figures from Public Health England (PHE) revealing a quarter of women do not attend their appointment. At present, swabs are carried out by medical professionals to see if there are any abnormal cells in the cervix, which would mean a referral for further investigation. Sometimes, if the changes are borderline, the sample is also tested for types of human papilloma virus (HPV) that are high risk for cervical cancer. Screening to look for HPV first is in the process of being rolled out, raising the possibility of self-collection of samples. PHE has already begun a pilot for a home smear test, while research has shown that HPV can also be detected in urine, meaning a less invasive approach might also be possible.   Related: Offer cancer screenings during lunch breaks, report urges    However, self-tests have a drawback – they do not provide cervical cells that can be examined should HPV be found. Now researchers say a new type of test based on DNA within self-collected urine or swab samples might provide an accurate way to determine whether an HPV-positive woman is likely to have precancerous or cancerous cells. The study, which is being presented at the National Cancer Research Institute conference in Glasgow and has not yet been published or peer reviewed, involved a test called S5. This detects whether DNA from four types of HPV linked to increased risk of cervical cancer has been modified through a process known as methylation. The test also looks at whether one particular human gene has undergone such changes. Previous work has shown high levels of methylation at specific sites in such DNA indicates a greater risk of a woman having cells that could turn into cervical cancer, or the presence of cancer itself. “Some HPV infections will resolve naturally, but the ones that are methylated are less likely to do so,” said Prof Jack Cuzick of Queen Mary University, part of the team behind the work. To explore the potential of the test, the team focused on 600 women who had already been found to have unusual cells and/or HPV, and had gone to a colposcopy clinic to have their cervix examined. Each woman was tested for HPV and provided a vaginal swab she had taken herself. Just over 500 of the women also provided a urine sample. DNA was then extracted from the samples and analysed to give an average score for the degree of methylation. The results reveal that for both urine and vaginal swabs from the women, the S5 test had about a 73% chance of correctly spotting women with advanced abnormal cells as diagnosed by colposcopy – putting it on a par with the standard test for high-risk HPV. But when the S5 test was used on HPV positive women, the figure rose to 96%. “This methylation test has been used on clinical samples and then shown to help identify those women with HPV [who also] really have serious disease,” said Cuzick. “This is the first time we have suggested that the same can be done on a self sample.” Dr Belinda Nedjai, another member of the team, said the findings suggest it might be possibly to use home samples both to spot those with HPV and identify those who are likely to have precancerous or cancerous cells and hence need to be referred for colposcopy investigations. That could mean an end to clinic-based cervical smears, although she said such an approach should first be used for women who do not attend screening appointments. Nedjai added the S5 test could also be valuable in countries without a screening programme in place."
54,cancer,Mass cervical cancer vaccine rollout could save 62 million lives in next 100 years," More than 74m cervical cancer cases and 62m deaths could be averted in the next 100 years if 78 of the world’s poorest countries rapidly deploy HPV vaccinations, cervical screening and cancer treatment, two new studies have projected. The predictive modelling is published on Friday in Lancet by Université Laval, Harvard University and Cancer Council New South Wales working with the World Health Organisation. All three teams independently developed their models based on the biological understanding of cervical cancer, and multiple data sources from multiple countries located in east Asia and Pacific, Europe and central Asia, Latin America and Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. “One of the exciting things for us about the new studies is the three teams did independent work but got very similar results,” director of research at Cancer Council NSW and adjunct professor Karen Canfell said.   Related: Cervical cancer is an avoidable disease – in theory, at least    While there has been some success in high-income countries like Australia, cervical cancer is still the fourth-most common cancer for women in the world, and the leading cause of cancer death in some low-income countries. A large majority of the 570,000 new cervical cancer cases worldwide in 2018 were in women living in low- and lower-middle income countries. The combination of vaccination of girls, along with twice-lifetime cervical cancer screening and access to invasive cervical cancer treatment was predicted to reduce cervical cancer incidence by 97% and mortality by almost 99%, averting more than 74 million cervical cancer cases and more than 62 million deaths in the next 100 years, she said. To reach this goal in the 78 low- and lower-middle income countries, the countries will need to get to 90% of girls vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV), 70% twice-lifetime cervical screenings with HPV testing, and 90% coverage for treatment of pre-invasive lesions and invasive cancer by 2030. “The idea is countries will use this to understand the impact of decisions that are made for investing in health today,” Canfell said. The research will be considered by WHO’s executive board next week, and by countries at the World Health Assembly in May.   Related: Cervical cancer could be eliminated in most countries by 2100 – research    Australia has led the charge in preventing and treating cervical cancer, and last year Canfell said Australia was on track to eliminating cervical cancer by 2035, and this week, Public Health England also released a study showing that as of the end of 2018 – 10 years since the vaccination program was introduced – there were no HPV infections detected in 16 to 18-year-old females. Canfell said every country would have its own challenges in implementing vaccinations, screenings and treatments. “All three of those interventions are proven, and they’re very effective in high-income countries, but they all have challenges in terms of logistics and implementation,” she said. “One of the biggest challenges is all three things will have to be country-level considerations of how to do it within the health systems that exist, or building health systems to implement these interventions. There will certainly be differences in the way things are implemented.”"
55,cancer,"Some gut bacteria may increase bowel cancer risk, research suggests","Bacteria in the gut might influence the chance of developing bowel cancer, research suggests, in the latest study to link human health to the microbes within. The gut microbiome – the collection of fungi, bacteria and viruses within our gut – is a booming topic of research, with scientists suggesting certain microbial makeups could be linked to conditions ranging from anxiety to obesity. But tinkering with this collection of microbes can also be beneficial: there has been growing interest in using faecal transplants to treat certain cases of Clostridium difficile. “We are trying to do a lot in terms of cancer prevention. Despite the fact the microbiome could be at play there is a lot more that is needed, and interdisciplinary research that is needed, to try and help in that field,” said Dr Kaitlin Wade, a researcher at the University of Bristol who is presenting the findings at the National Cancer Research Institute’s cancer conference in Glasgow.   Related: Bowel cancer rise among UK under-50s prompts screening call    The study – yet to be published or peer reviewed – involved Wade and colleagues looking at the genetic and gut microbiome data of about 4,000 people across three European projects and exploring whether there were genetic variants linked to the presence of certain gut bacteria. As such genetic variants are randomly spread throughout the population, the approach is a type of natural experiment. The team found 13 genetic variants each linked to variations in a different type of gut bacteria. They then looked at another set of data from about 120,000 people to see whether those with the genetic variants had a greater tendency of developing bowel cancer. The results reveal those whose genes increased the likelihood of having a type of Bacteroidales bacteria had a 2% to 15% increased risk of the disease. The team said the findings back up previous research suggesting bacteria are more common in those with bowel cancer. But since genetic makeup is set at the start of life, the study suggests these bacteria could be playing a role in actually causing bowel cancer. Many questions remain, including whether the genetic variants linked to the gut bacteria are directly driving the increased risk of bowel cancer. “The actual genetic changes [themselves] could be associated with the disease first and foremost which then drives variation in the bacteria,” said Wade. It could also be that these variants drive a preference for a certain diet, which could directly affect the risk of bowel cancer, or influence the makeup of the microbiome, affecting the chance of developing the disease. Wade said the team now needed to pin down the exact species of Bacteroidales that appear to be linked to bowel cancer, and added that further research was needed to explore whether changing levels of these microbes could reduce bowel cancer risk – and whether such an approach could have unintended consequences.   Related: Bowel cancer trial aims to reset gut bacteria    “What we need to do in terms of further work is to understand not only what the [specific] bacteria [behind this link] are,” said Wade, “but understand what potential off target effects there could be if we were interested in altering [these bacteria].” Prof Tim Spector, an expert in the gut microbiome at King’s College London and author of The Diet Myth, said the study was a step in the right direction in unpicking the link between bowel cancer and the microbiome, but that there was a long way to go. “The problem is – like genes – there is no one single criminal and there are likely to be hundreds of microbes changing our risk of [bowel] cancer,” he said. “At present our best defence is to cultivate the most healthy diverse gut communities by eating a wide diversity of plants, full of fibre and polyphenol chemicals.” • This article was amended on 4 November 2019. In an earlier version, we referred to a study that looked at bacteria data from “about 2,000 people”. This has been corrected to say “about 120,000 people”."
56,cancer,Anger over UK's failure to ban breast implants linked to 61 cancer cases,"At least 61 women in the UK have been diagnosed with a potentially fatal cancer linked to breast implants, but the type they received continues to be used, with no plans by the regulator to follow France and Australia in banning them. Lawyers for more than 40 of the women, who are bringing legal action against the manufacturers as well as the clinics and doctors who carried out the surgery, say the textured implants linked to anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) should be withdrawn from the market. Smooth implants are available instead, which have no proven connection to the cancer of the white blood cells. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says the disease is very rare, but Sarah Moore, a solicitor at Leigh Day law firm, believes there are more cases than the regulator is aware of. “I think there has been misdiagnosis and under-diagnosis, and I think we have to bear in mind that in the last 18 months there have been 17 more reported cases of ALCL,” she said. “There is now greater patient awareness and as a result, I think women are pushing for diagnosis. I think we’re going to see a significant increase in diagnosis, unfortunately.” The leading manufacturer of textured implants, Allergan, has withdrawn them from worldwide sale. In December 2018 its European kitemark for the implants expired – the French agency that had granted certification had asked for extra safety data that the company said it could not provide in time. They have not been on sale in Europe since then. The US authorities asked the company to recall its textured implants in July 2019 and Allergan took them off the market. France and Australia have since banned the sales of all textured implants, although neither has suggested that women should actively seek to have them removed. In the UK, other brands of textured implants are still in use. Neither NHS England, the NHS Business Services Authority nor the MHRA could say how many had been given to women in the NHS after a mastectomy for breast cancer. The MHRA says women should be counselled about the risk of breast implant-associated (BIA) ALCL, but it says the chances of having to undergo revision surgery are higher with smooth implants. “We understand the concern that some individuals may have about this very rare disease. Research is ongoing in the UK and worldwide to better understand how BIA-ALCL develops,” said an MHRA spokesperson. “Based on our analysis of the latest scientific evidence and expert clinical input, our advice remains unchanged: there is no new evidence of an increased risk to patients and there is no need for people with breast implants to have them removed in the absence of any symptoms.” Moore says the MHRA’s position is worrying. “It is deeply concerning that the MHRA continues to adopt a ‘keep calm and carry on’ position when it comes to BIA-ALCL,” she said. “We are continuing to be approached by women who have been diagnosed in the last year and who have had to battle to get that diagnosis and appropriate treatment.” Her clients were motivated by anger and a sense of justice, she said. None was given any warning, even those who had surgery as late as 2016, when the World Health Organization published guidance on the link with cancer. “They were never told there were these risks involved and they feel incredibly angry. They have had a product which is supposed to be life-enhancing and yet it has caused them to suffer potentially life-threatening cancer.” Prof Fabio di Pompeo Santanelli, chair of plastic surgery at the University Sapienza of Rome, has been sounding the alarm about BIA-ALCL since 2011, he said. In October he and a US expert, Dr Mark Clemens, convened the first world forum on the disease. Santanelli presented data for the number of women affected in Europe, showing 287 diagnosed cases so far and 11 deaths. He believes doctors should feel morally obliged not to use textured implants. “Do you agree you can implant something for cosmetic reasons – because breast augmentation and breast reconstruction are cosmetic procedures? Are you allowed to risk giving someone lymphoma for a cosmetic reason? In my view, no – not a single one,” he said. BIA-ALCL causes fluid to build up around the breast and can cause lumps, swelling and pain. Caught early, it can be easily treated by removal of the implant and the scar tissue around it. If it is not, it may spread. Moore believes the UK should ban all textured implants and that there needs to be far better regulation of the cosmetic surgery industry. “The cosmetic surgery market is just rife with cowboys. It’s rife with poor regulation and it preys on quite a vulnerable sector of society,” Moore said. “It seems to me that this cancer is a rather grim but logical sequela of leaving an industry unregulated for so long.” The MHRA spokesman said it was “working closely with clinical stakeholders to raise awareness of this rare disease” and pointed to information on its website. “Clinicians are reminded of the importance of reporting to us any cases of ALCL in their patients who have, or had, breast implants via our yellow card scheme. This information will help us build a more accurate picture of the occurrence of this rare disease,” he said. ‘I have to live with this for the rest of my life’     Carla Wilson, who is in remission from lymphoma. Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian    Carla Wilson, 37, had never heard of a blood cancer linked to breast implants when she decided, after much research, to have surgery in 2012. She was given the standard warnings about infection and other minor risks. But even though the medical regulator knew in 2011 that textured implants had been linked to a kind of lymphoma, none of the three separate surgeons she saw mentioned it. The swelling in her right breast four years afterwards, in December 2016, was nothing to worry about, said her surgeon. “He basically said to me, ‘You have probably pulled something at the gym.’ He said to have a hot bath and some ibuprofen and sent me on my way,” she said. But the swelling kept coming back. She saw her GP. “She actually said, ‘This is cosmetic surgery – you should go and see your surgeon,’ but the vibe I got was that she was very judgmental about the fact that I’d had surgery,” said Wilson. By then, the MHRA had sent letters to doctors warning about BIA-ALCL. But nobody was looking for it, and if Wilson had not been a persistent self-advocate, she said, “Who knows what would have happened?” Wilson had been given a textured implant made by Nagor, which is still on the market in the UK. When emails to her surgeon received no response, she contacted the clinic. Another surgeon, who ran it, invited her in and realised the swelling needed urgent attention. He advised that a build-up of fluid should be drained and the implants be replaced – but she would have to self-fund the surgery, which cost several thousand pounds. Luckily, she said, she could raise the money. “Without that, I could have gone on for another six to 12 months, and who knows what could have happened? It doesn’t bear thinking about,” she said. After the operation, she expected to be given the all-clear. Instead, she was asked to sit down. Tests on the fluid had come back as “highly suspicious” of the blood cancer ALCL. “It was a bit of a smack in the face. It had never even been on the table before,” she said. The implants then had to be removed in a third operation, along with the scar tissue that forms around them inside the breast. This time, the GP was sympathetic. Wilson was referred to an NHS breast care consultant and then into the private sector because she had medical insurance. “I wasn’t allowed any kind of reconstruction, which is difficult for a woman in her early 30s. What I was left with was a mess,” she said. “It affected me a lot as a person. I got very depressed. I lost confidence. It was affecting my job because I wasn’t able to work properly through the surgeries. It was a really difficult time.” In a recurrence 12 months later, her breast swelled up again. “I was kind of numb. You go on autopilot. I’d been told it wouldn’t come back,” Wilson said. “I thought it must be a complication. Something normal.” But it was ALCL again, and within days she was in the operating theatre for the fourth time. And finding herself by now a better-informed patient about this rare disease, she spent stressful weeks arguing that the evidence indicated that neither chemotherapy nor radiotherapy would benefit her. “So far I have remained in remission,” Wilson said. “But this is something I’m going to have to live with for the rest of my life.” Nevertheless, she said, “I’m one of the lucky ones. I’m quite active in advocacy circles. People die from this.”"
57,cancer,Low-cost breast cancer drug 'could save lives in low-income countries',"A cheap version of the groundbreaking breast cancer drug Herceptin has been approved by the World Health Organization, raising the possibility of lifesaving treatment for the first time for women in low-income countries. Herceptin is the brand name of trastuzumab, a drug which by 2006 in the UK was the subject of a huge battle for access for the 20% of women with the type of cancer, called HER2+, that it targets. Trial results released at a conference in the United States fired up campaigners. There were marches in the streets, legal actions and an unprecedented political decision by the then UK health secretary Patricia Hewitt to pay for the drug regardless before any cost-effectiveness assessment had been completed. It is now a standard treatment for women with HER2+ cancer in affluent countries, with a high cure rate, particularly in early cancers. The WHO listed it as an essential medicine for all countries to buy, but it has been unaffordable in much of the world, with a price tag of about $20,000 (£15,000) per patient. With the drug now out of patent, the WHO has approved a biosimilar version – a cheap copy – of the monoclonal antibody made by a company in the Netherlands. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said it was good news for women everywhere. “Women in many cultures suffer from gender disparity when it comes to accessing health services. In poor countries, there is the added burden of a lack of access to treatment for many, and the high cost of medicines. Effective, affordable breast cancer treatment should be a right for all women, not the privilege of a few,” he said. The medicine, made by a company called Samsung Bioepis, was assessed by WHO and found comparable to the original in terms of efficacy, safety and quality. That means it is eligible for procurement by United Nations agencies and for national tenders. The price will be 65% lower than Herceptin itself, which at about $9,000 is still a burden for lower income countries, but it is expected that other companies will now come forward for WHO approval. Some of them already sell trastuzumab for as little as $4,000 per patient, but without the WHO stamp their drugs can only be sold in countries that have their own approval process.   Related: Breast cancer may be detected by blood test five years before clinical signs show    Death rates from breast cancer are high in low income countries, even though it has become a very curable disease in the more affluent parts of the world. In 2018, 2.1 million women contracted breast cancer and 630,000 of them died from the disease, many because of late diagnosis and lack of access to affordable treatment. WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer estimates that by 2040 the number of diagnosed breast cancers will reach 3.1 million, with the greatest increase in low- and middle-income countries. “We need to act now and try to avoid more preventable deaths,” says Dr Mariângela Simão, WHO assistant director general for medicines and health products. “The availability of biosimilars has decreased prices, making even innovative treatments more affordable and hopefully available to more people.”"
58,cancer,Ruth Bader Ginsburg says she is 'cancer-free' after spate of health scares,"Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is starting the year off “cancer-free” and has resumed an active role as part of the supreme court’s liberal bloc. In a rare interview with CNN, the 86-year-old justice, whose health has preoccupied the public as the court shifts to the right under Donald Trump’s presidency, offered an update: “I’m cancer-free. That’s good,” she said, sounding “energized”, according to CNN. The oldest member of the court has experienced a series of health scares recently. In November, she missed oral arguments in the court due to a stomach bug and was hospitalized later that month with a fever. In August, Ginsburg underwent a successful treatment of a tumor on her pancreas, announcing that there was “no evidence of disease elsewhere in the body”. She was operated on for lung cancer in December 2018 and has survived the disease four times.   Related: Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a hero to women. A future without her is a chilling prospect | Moira Donegan    The court is expected to take on several landmark cases this year, including ruling on a severely restrictive Louisiana abortion law and whether Congress can compel the release of Trump’s tax and financial records. Oral arguments in the court will resume next week. Should Ginsburg vacate her seat on the court, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, indicated that he would confirm a Trump nominee to replace her, despite blocking a nominee from Barack Obama during the 2016 election year. In a July interview with NPR, Ginsburg made light of her health scares, recalling that a senator, after she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2005, “announced with great glee that I was going to be dead within six months”. “That senator, whose name I have forgotten, is now himself dead,” she said. “And I am very much alive.”"
59,cancer,Reporting on 'Cancer Town': 'We will hold politicians accountable for inaction',"As you turn a sharp bend on Louisiana’s Highway 44 on the way in to the small town of Reserve, the horizon is broken almost immediately by a tall, imposing structure that billows large plumes from its stacks. This is the Pontchartrain Works, a towering chemicals plant that has stood on this land, about 45 miles from the city of New Orleans, for over 50 years. For decades, the residents of Reserve had accepted the plant’s existence as a minor inconvenience. It is an eyesore and the cause of frequent foul-tasting air. But there was little available evidence to suggest that a series of extraordinary illnesses experienced in the community – rare autoimmune diseases, chronic lung problems, multiple cancer deaths – were linked to pollution from the plant next door. That was until 2015, when the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released an “air toxics” report that said Pontchartrain Works was the primary reason that Reserve was the location with the highest risk of cancer due to airborne toxins anywhere in the US. This is largely due to a substance called chloroprene, now listed as a “likely carcinogen”, that is emitted by the plant, which is now the only place in America to produce a synthetic rubber called neoprene. In an area of land next to the plant, a sprawl of suburban housing occupied almost entirely by African American residents, the cancer risk is 50 times the national average. It’s this site that I and my former colleague Jamiles Lartey have visited numerous times in the past six months for the Guardian’s year-long reporting project Cancer Town. Our aim has been to give sustained, international coverage to the fight for clean air in this area of southern Louisiana, with a series of investigative reports, profiles, historical context and reporting from neighbouring communities fighting similar battles against big polluters. We have followed the small but growing number of activists from Reserve as they marched dozens of miles to protest, and covered two trips that residents have made to Japan, where they tried in vain to force meetings with the executives of the Japanese petrochemicals company Denka, which operates neoprene production at Pontchartrain Works. This summer we co-sponsored two town hall events in New Orleans and Reserve with the national civil rights leader Rev William Barber, who has placed air pollution here at the centre of his national moral revival campaign and challenged the Democratic candidates for president to visit Reserve.     Rev William Barber, centre right, at the entrance to the Pontchartrain Works, flanked by a community activist, Robert Taylor (centre left), and Sharon Lavigne of the environmental campaign group Rise St James. Photograph: Julie Dermanksy/The Guardian    “If you cannot come here to Reserve, then you don’t have any business being president,” Barber said outside the Pontchartrain Works on a sweltering day back in July. “If you can’t come here to Cancer Alley, you don’t need to be at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.” His words have not gone unnoticed. Last month, the Democratic frontrunner Elizabeth Warren released an environmental justice platform placing air pollution in Reserve at the centre of her ambitious policy pledge. The New Jersey senator Cory Booker has also visited the region and pushed legislation in Congress. But if the residents of Reserve are to be victorious – their demands include that emissions from the plant fall to what the EPA defines as a safe exposure limit – they will need support from local legislators. Louisiana, in America’s deep south, has earned a reputation for its notoriously lax approach to environmental regulation, often favouring a cash-rich oil industry that dominates the state’s economy. Indeed, many local officials have old employment ties to the plant, which for almost five decades was run by the US chemicals giant DuPont. But, since the start of our project, there have been rare signs of progress for the community. Shortly after its launch, Louisiana’s state environment department issued notice that it planned to sue both DuPont and Denka over alleged violations of the Clean Air Act. A civil lawsuit is ongoing. The governor of Louisiana has commissioned an official health study to examine cancer rates in Reserve amid criticisms of current data. The local school board has begun examining whether to close an elementary school that sits a few hundred feet from the plant. Much of the long-term outcome from this battle lies in the results of two elections. The first, the race for Louisiana’s next governor, will be decided on Saturday. The conservative Democratic incumbent, John Bel Edwards, who despite being a petrochemical industry backer has inched towards action in Reserve, faces off against a Trump-endorsed Republican, Eddie Rispone, who has expressed no interest in the community here. The second is the presidential election next year. The Trump presidency has already spelled disaster for environmental causes in the US, with the rolling-back of dozens of protections and a decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. Four more years will almost certainly lead to further damage in Reserve. Irrespective of the results, the Guardian is committed to covering what happens next in Cancer Town. To telling the stories of those who have lost loved ones to disease they link to emissions from the plant. To report stories showing the consequences of loose and poorly enforced environmental law along with its deep connections to race and economic inequality in this region. And to hold politicians accountable for inaction. Our reporting here has drawn us into the community’s struggle. And we are thankful to the residents who have invited us into their homes and told us intimate details about their own health and the devastation they have felt losing loved ones to cancer. I often think of the words of Robert Taylor, a leading community activist in Reserve who has lived here his whole life. Taylor has lost his mother, sister and nephews to cancer, his wife is currently fighting the disease, and his daughter is battling a rare intestinal disease linked to chloroprene. “I still can’t believe that this one community could be asked to suffer this much, merely for the profit of these foreign corporations,” he told us. “What kind of people are they to knowingly wipe out a whole community of people for profit?” "

61,cancer,#WhatsYourExcuse: Canadian teen with terminal cancer urges others to vote,"After receiving a devastating diagnosis of terminal cancer last week, an 18-year old Canadian woman is using her final days to inspire her fellow citizens to vote in the country’s upcoming election. Maddison Yetman was diagnosed with cancer last week after finding strange bruising on her legs. She was told the advanced stage of the sarcoma meant she probably had only days left. But in a video posted to Twitter on Tuesday, Yetman flips through a series of signs, telling Canadians that despite her “very limited time”, she had managed to cast a ballot in her first federal election.    This is my last chance to make a difference. Please share this with your network and get out and vote! #whatsyourexcuse @justinpjtrudeau @andrewjscheer @jagmeetsingh @MaximeBernier @liberalca @cpc_hq @ndp @peoplespca @CanadianGreens #cdnpoli #Elxn43 #canpoli pic.twitter.com/xxfXxuOrEf&mdash; Maddison (@MaddiYet) October 15, 2019    “If I can find the time to vote, you can find the time to vote,” Yetman says, finishing on a placard that reads: “#WhatsYourExcuse.” “She has time left on this Earth that is measurable in hours and she took time to vote,” her uncle, Brent Williamson, told the Canadian Press. “And yet 30 to 35% of Canadians won’t bother to go vote.” The video, which has been viewed nearly 500,000 times, has been shared by federal leaders, who praised the teen’s message “I’m speechless. This is truly powerful, Maddison – thank you for your courage in the face of adversity,” tweeted Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic party. “Please watch Maddison’s video, and please hear the call to action. Your voice, like Maddison’s, deserves to be heard.”   Related: Scandal on all sides as Canada  heads for ‘election of discontent’    The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, thanked Yetman for “reminding us how precious a vote is”. With less than a week before Canada’s general election, there is uncertainty surrounding voter turnout, following an acrimonious campaign. In early voting last week, Elections Canada reported 4.3m ballots – a surge of 29%. But experts cautioned that a holiday weekend – which made voting more convenient – was probably a large factor in encouraging early turnout. Still, Yetman’s family is hopeful her message will resonate in the coming days. “At her young age she understood how important our democracy is and our political system, and really wanted to play a part in it,” said Williamson. “[She] got to [vote] for one election and it’s pretty unfortunate she won’t be around to do it for others.”"
62,cancer,NHS bed shortages cause late cancellation of cancer surgeries,"One of the NHS’s biggest hospital trusts has apologised to a 78-year-old man after it had to cancel his cancer surgery twice in a month because of a lack of beds. On both occasions the patient, who has liver cancer, waited in the hospital for six hours and was ready to go into the operating theatre to have his tumour removed when he was sent home. Staff at Leicester general hospital explained to him that there was no high-dependency bed for him if he experienced complications during the surgery. “When I was diagnosed, I was told it was treatable, there was a good outcome because we’d caught it in good time. But when does good time run out? The stress levels go up every day that this carries on,” said the man, a retired electrical engineer, who did not want to be named. “I’ve been sent home twice now after mentally and physically preparing for an operation. Meanwhile, I’m sat here, with cancer of the liver, not knowing when I will be rid of it.” The man was initially due to have the operation on 13 August and, when that was called off, given a new date of 10 September. Both times the surgery was cancelled after he had taken drugs to prepare him for the procedure and had not eaten since the night before. He is one of a number of people with cancer whose surgery has been cancelled by University Hospitals of Leicester NHS trust because of a shortage of high-dependency beds. He is now due to have the operation on 25 September, 128 days after he was diagnosed. His case, first publicised by the Leicester Mercury, is a stark illustration of an NHS-wide problem, which specialists in intensive care say is worsening. People in need of a new hip or knee, or of vascular surgery, are having operations delayed as well. “It is unacceptable that some people living with cancer are experiencing last-minute cancellations for surgery for nonclinical reasons. These people will have prepared both practically and emotionally for their operation, and this news will cause additional stress and upset at an already difficult time,” said Dr Moira Fraser-Pearce, a spokeswoman for Macmillan Cancer Support.  “We worry that these cancellations in Leicester are just one example of similar challenges faced by NHS trusts across the country, and symptomatic of a system which is underfunded and understaffed. This must not become the ‘new normal’.” A record 4.4 million people are waiting to go into hospital in England for a planned procedure, such as a hernia repair or cataract removal. But many trusts are finding it impossible to treat 92% of those patients within 18 weeks, as they are required to do by the NHS constitution, because of bed shortages and staffing problems, which the doctors’ pensions problem has exacerbated – senior doctors have been reducing their hours and turning down extra work, to avoid large tax bills on their pensions. Labour’s shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, a Leicester MP, said: “To have life-saving cancer operations cancelled twice like this is an absolute disgrace. I can’t imagine the anguish this gentleman and his loved ones must be going through.” Dr Carl Waldmann, dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, a doctors’ professional body, said that 80% of intensive care units across the UK had to transfer patients elsewhere last year because of bed shortages, and that 40% had closed beds as a direct result of staffing problems. While the ageing population and life-extending advances in medicine have increased the demand for high-dependency and intensive-care beds, this has not been accompanied by any rise in bed numbers, leaving hospitals often struggling to cope, Waldmann said. John Adler, the Leicester NHS trust’s chief executive, said: “Cancelling operations is not a decision we ever take lightly. We recognise the worry and distress that cancelling an operation can cause our patients and their families. But the safety of our patients is our main priority. “Between 1 January and 17 September 2019 we carried out over 5,000 operations on patients with cancer. Regrettably, 0.2% of those patients had their planned surgery cancelled twice, but we made it a priority to rebook those operations as soon as possible. “We cannot operate on patients if we have nowhere to care for them. We cancelled these cancer operations predominantly due to the lack of a bed in intensive care.” The trust is building an 11-bed extension to the intensive care unit at its Glenfield hospital. It plans to add six more beds at Leicester Royal Infirmary, and hopes eventually to increase its supply of beds from 66 to 100. It may do the same at Leicester general too. Adler added: “The key constraint is the availability of sufficient medical and nursing staff for the additional beds. But we will add extra beds if we safely can.”"
63,cancer,Rod Stewart given all-clear following secret cancer treatment,"Rod Stewart has revealed he was diagnosed with prostate cancer two years ago, and has now been given the all-clear, following treatment. Speaking at a fundraising event for the Prostate Project charity, he said: “Two years ago I was ­diagnosed with prostate cancer. I’m in the clear now, simply because I caught it early … I’ve worked for two years and I’ve just been happy, and the good Lord looked after me.” He recommended men have their prostates checked: “Guys, you’ve got to really go to the doctor … Finger up the bum, no harm done.” At the event, he also reunited for a performance with former Faces bandmates Ronnie Wood and Kenney Jones. It is the second time Stewart, 74, has had treatment for cancer – in 2000, he was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. “I felt fearful, vulnerable to a degree that I never had before,” he later wrote in an autobiography, but the tumour was quickly removed. “No chemotherapy was required – which, in turn, meant there was no risk that I’d lose my hair,” he wrote. “And let’s face it: if we’re ranking threats to the survival of my career, losing my hair would be second only to losing my voice.” Stewart is beginning a short Las Vegas concert residency this week, ahead of an arena tour of the UK beginning in Manchester on 23 November. His most recent album, Blood Red Roses, was released in September 2018 and reached No 1 in the UK."
64,cancer,Asylum seeker denied cancer treatment by Home Office dies,"An Ethiopian woman who was denied potentially life-saving cancer treatment for six weeks amid confusion about whether she should be charged by the NHS has died aged 39. Kelemua Mulat, who had advanced breast cancer, was refused chemotherapy last year after Home Office and NHS officials decided that she was not eligible for free care. Mulat, a mother of one, was eventually treated by the internationally renowned Christie hospital in Manchester after its doctors expressed concern and said her need was “immediately necessary”, which is permitted treatment under the rules.   Related: Home Office prevented asylum seeker's urgent cancer treatment    Her lawyer, Jeremy Bloom, said that her death showed the “real and sickening human cost” of the government’s hostile environment strategy, which forces the NHS to impose upfront charges on migrants deemed ineligible for free care. Bloom, of the law firm Duncan Lewis, said Mulat “suffered unnecessarily as the result of a flawed policy”, which “seek[s] to make hospital staff act as immigration officers, a job for which they are ill-prepared and ill-suited”. Mulat is one of hundreds of patients who have been denied treatment for serious health problems under the policy, which is strongly opposed by Britain’s doctors. In Mulat’s case, consultants at Christie hospital believed that chemotherapy was “immediately necessary” in April last year to treat the metastatic breast cancer that had spread to her abdomen and spine. However, she was refused treatment for six weeks due to the way her asylum claim had been processed by the Home Office. She eventually began chemotherapy on 7 June after her case was highlighted by the Guardian. After she was initially turned away from the Christie, Mulat was prescribed a “stopgap treatment” of a daily Letrozole tablet and a monthly Zoladex injection. For this she was invoiced £3,379, causing significant distress. Bloom said Mulat should have been automatically eligible for treatment after doctors deemed it “immediately urgent and necessary”. Yet despite her illness and vulnerability, he said she was “forced to fight a legal battle to secure the treatment that she needed and to have a bill cancelled that may have affected any future applications for leave”.      Kelemua Mulat Photograph: Handout    He added: “Ms Mulat’s additional pain and suffering may have been avoided if the Home Office had provided accurate information to the hospital about her immigration status – or better yet, if hospitals were not compelled to carry out this discriminatory and unjust policy.” Mulat had no family in Britain but was cared for by her close friend and legal next-of-kin, Sara Jackson, who blamed the government’s hostile environment policy for her death. “The Home Office, they killed her – they really did,” said Jackson, an interpreter for Ethiopians living in Britain. “This girl needed help at that time. I love this country and my kids were born in this country but the way this happened – the way they stopped her treatment – it has to be highlighted.” In June last year, Mulat told the Guardian she felt she had been “left to die” by the government. Her cancer caused crippling pain throughout her body and she was unable to retain any food or water without struggle. Jackson said her condition deteriorated significantly in recent weeks and she was moved to a hospice in Salford, where she died on 8 September. Mulat’s friends have launched a crowdfunding campaign to grant her dying wish for her body to be flown back to her mother and daughter in Ethiopia. The cost for the repatriation is £4,500, said Jackson, adding that any additional money would be sent to Mulat’s daughter and used for a service at the Ethiopian orthodox church in Manchester. Anna Jones, the co-founder of charity RefuAid, which supported Mulat, said: “It took six weeks of advocacy and navigating bureaucracy within the Home Office to have Kelemua’s care at the Christie hospital permitted. “Six weeks of chemotherapy and treatment is likely to have made some difference to her prognosis. This is yet another example of how the unnecessary bureaucracy within the Home Office and the current government’s policy of creating a hostile environment is causing needless deaths.” Mulat arrived in Britain in July 2015, five years after fleeing Ethiopia when her partner, the father of her daughter, was reputedly shot dead by pro-government forces after he took part in protests.   Related: Home Office Windrush report damns hostile environment policy    She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013 in Greece, where she underwent treatment paid for by the United Nations refugee agency. Her first asylum claim in Britain was rejected in August 2016 and her section 4 asylum support, which includes NHS healthcare and a £35.39 weekly support allowance, was stopped in February this year. Mulat was later granted limited leave to stay in the UK on the grounds of her private life when the Home Office became aware of her deteriorating health. She had been surviving on food parcels, donations from nurses at the Christie and Wythenshawe hospitals and supermarket vouchers from the British Red Cross destitution service, while living in Home Office accommodation in Salford with four other female asylum seekers. On 25 April Mulat’s lawyers submitted new evidence arguing that she would face political imprisonment if she were forced to return to Ethiopia. However, the Home Office classified the evidence as “further submissions” instead of a fresh application: a small but crucial difference which meant that, in the eyes of government bureaucrats, Mulat was not entitled to free healthcare. Had her evidence been seen as a fresh asylum claim, she would have been allowed chemotherapy immediately. Mulat also reapplied for section 4 support on 25 April, which would have entitled her to free healthcare, but this was not granted until six weeks later – a day after the Guardian contacted the Home Office. A Home Office spokesman said: “Our thoughts and condolences are with the family and friends of Ms Mulat. We are committed to ensuring that asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute are supported while applications are considered, including having free access to NHS healthcare.”"
65,cancer,'There should be clear warnings': hair dye cancer risk stokes fear in black women,"Priscilla Graves is a hairstylist with 15 years’ experience straightening and coloring black women’s hair. She has endured bouts of dizziness, nausea and difficulty breathing from applying potent chemical straighteners, and regularly deals with distraught clients suffering alopecia and painful blisters after using dyes and lotions specifically marketed to African Americans. “I try to find out online what’s in the products, but the government should be doing more to keep us safe and keep dangerous chemicals out of cosmetics,” said Graves, 34, at a salon in Harlem. “There should be clear warnings on the labels, we need more information.” The risks are very real. A new landmark study that tracked almost 47,000 American women over eight years has found that using permanent hair dye increases a black woman’s risk of breast cancer by 45%, compared to an increased risk of 7% in white women. The more frequently women colored their hair, the greater the risk, rising to 60% for black women who used permanent dyes at least every five to eight weeks. Prior studies on the link between hair dye use and cancer had been inconsistent. It’s not certain why, but several studies suggest that cosmetic products specifically designed for use by black women and children contain more chemicals that disrupt the endocrine or hormonal system than products aimed at white women. Disrupting the endocrine system – which regulates reproduction, metabolism, sleep, tissue function and growth and development – can cause cancerous tumors, birth defects, reproductive problems, developmental and neurological disorders. The way dye is applied and differences in hair texture and absorption could also play a role.     Priscilla Graves mixes hair dying product at the Aicha’s African braiding salon in Harlem. Photograph: Demetrius Freeman/The Guardian    Hair products sold in the US contain more than 5,000 chemicals, including aromatic amines in dyes that can cause DNA mutations, parabens in hair lotions that are linked to reproductive and hormonal problems and known carcinogens such as formaldehyde, which are used in embalming fluids and some popular hair smoothing or straightening products. But information about toxic chemicals is not easy to find. Manufacturers are not federally required to list ingredients on professional salon products. In the EU, at least 1,300 chemicals are banned or restricted in cosmetics such as shampoos, soaps, dyes and nail polish, while the US has outlawed or curbed only 11. The study, published in the International Journal of Cancer, is the first to analyze the link between chemical hair straighteners and breast cancer since the introduction of so-called Brazilian keratin treatments, which contain up to 11.5% formaldehyde, to the global market in the 2000s. The researchers found that regardless of race, using hair straighteners at least every five to eight weeks increased the risk of breast cancer by 31%. About 74% of black women reported using chemical straighteners compared to only 3% of white women. “Black women straighten their hair to assimilate,” said Amelia Govan, 31, a sales rep who as a teenager straightened her hair every month. “We have to fit in – you never see black women with braids working in corporate.” “It’s popular with African American women, who still associate curly hair with being ugly,” said Graves, whose current salon does not use Brazilian keratin treatments on safety grounds. “That stuff makes you sick, it made my eyes and throat burn. It should be banned.” Graves’ mother has used chemical straighteners all her life and is currently undergoing treatment for breast cancer; several other relatives have had the disease. “I need to know what’s in the products, as I’m already high-risk,” she said. “My clients are increasingly worried about the dangers.” Breast cancer is an unequal disease. Almost one in three African American women diagnosed with breast cancer dies – a 40% higher mortality rate than white women, according to the Centers for Disease Control.     Priscilla Graves at the Aicha’s African braiding salon in Harlem. Photograph: Demetrius Freeman/The Guardian    The reasons for the disparities are not fully understood, but black women are more likely to be diagnosed later, and with aggressive tumors. African Americans are also disproportionately exposed to high rates of carcinogens and other dangerous chemicals from polluting fossil fuel plants and factories – and toxic cosmetics.  The global beauty industry is huge: in 2017, the cosmetics products market was worth $532bn and is expected to grow 50% by 2023. Last year in the US, consumers could choose from 2,727,847 lines of cosmetic imports from 177 countries. African Americans spent $473m on haircare in 2017, accounting for almost 9% of sales. But standards and regulations vary hugely across the world. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is not required to approve or review the safety of cosmetic products and ingredients, other than color additives. In fact, participation in many FDA regulatory mechanisms, such as product registration and recall, is completely voluntary for manufacturers. In 2018, for instance, the FDA issued a warning about hair smoothing products containing formaldehyde, but was powerless to recall or ban them. The beauty industry says the onus should be on consumers, not manufacturers. “People have been told that these straighteners are not a good idea, industry should not be held responsible if they choose not to pay attention to recommendations,” said Ken Marenus, president of the industry group Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors (ICMAD). He insists that most US manufacturers already follow international standards, but agrees that regulations needs to be updated.    The current standards are ineffective and inadequate, and it’s especially bad for black women  Janet Nudelman      “The current standards are ineffective and inadequate, and it’s especially bad for black women because products marketed to them are the most toxic,” said Janet Nudelman, director of Breast Cancer Prevention Partners’ campaign for safe cosmetics, which wants American consumers to be protected like those in Europe. The congressional energy and commerce committee is currently considering legislation which would overhaul cosmetics regulation and could vastly expand FDA powers. The most ambitious bill on the table is proposed by the Illinois congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, and includes provisions designed to protect “highly exposed and vulnerable populations” including salon workers and women of color. The bill would immediately ban 12 toxic ingredients such as formaldehyde, parabens, lead compounds and coal tar dye, and includes federal money for research into chemicals linked to adverse health effects among women and girls of color and the marketing of those products, as well as support research to develop safer alternative ingredients. . In Harlem, consumers and stylists want more information, and better protection from toxins. Hairstylist Astou Sow, 40, who is originally from Senegal but lived in France before moving to the US, said: “In Europe they care much more about quality, safety and good health. Here it’s mostly about business and money.”"
66,cancer,Democrat takes first public stance on air pollution in Cancer Alley after Guardian report,"Louisiana’s lone Democratic congressman Cedric Richmond has taken his first public stance on air pollution in the town of Reserve and has committed to holding a public meeting with residents later in the year, following a report in the Guardian examining his track record on local environmental issues. Richmond, a senior House Democrat who co-chairs Joe Biden’s presidential campaign, has held Louisiana’s second congressional district since 2010. The area covers some of the most polluted air in America, along a corridor of industrial facilities between New Orleans and Baton Rouge known colloquially as “Cancer Alley”.   box   Richmond, one of the highest recipients of oil, gas and chemicals industry donations in the Democratic House caucus, had made scant public remarks about pollution in Reserve, the subject of a year-long Guardian series “Cancer Town”. In one census tract in Reserve the risk of cancer due to air pollution is 50 times the national average. The primary cause of this risk is a pollutant named chloroprene, listed by the EPA as a likely human carcinogen, which is emitted by a synthetic rubber plant operated by the Japanese chemicals company Denka since 2015 and by chemicals giant DuPont from 1967. But in a letter sent this week to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Louisiana’s environment secretary, Chuck Carr Brown, Richmond states: “Louisiana has been disproportionately affected by the detrimental environmental effects of plant emissions. While economic vitality is important, it cannot ignore the reality of deteriorating air quality and the risks it poses. “For far too many years, people in communities along the Mississippi River have repeatedly expressed these very concerns which has prompted the federal government to intervene in the absence of action.” The EPA has moved to change its air monitoring system in Reserve, which currently takes air quality readings once every six days to examine whether Denka is emitting chloroprene over the lifetime exposure guidelines, set by the agency, of 0.2 micrograms per cubic meter. Readings are often still dozens of times above the threshold but have fallen since Denka entered a voluntary agreement with the state to reduce emissions by 85%. From April, the EPA will use new “Spod” air monitors that are designed to track spikes in pollutants. While some local environmentalists have hailed the move, others remain concerned that the new technology will not record dangerous levels of chloroprene emissions above the 0.2 guidelines set by the EPA but below a significant “plume” of the toxin. Richmond commended the EPA’s move in his letter, acknowledging the “importance of closely monitoring dangerously high chloroprene emissions moving forward”. But he called on the EPA and Carr Brown to call a meeting to explain the new technology to local residents. Jalina Porter, a spokeswoman for Richmond’s office told the Guardian that a date for the meeting had not yet been set as the congressman was awaiting a response. Porter said it was expected the congressman would hold a town hall on the issue at a venue close to one of his office locations in New Orleans. Robert Taylor, executive director of the Concerned Citizens of St John the Baptist parish, the community group fighting for clean air in Reserve, said Richmond’s proposed town hall meeting was “a good thing, but only if he’s sincere in helping us in this serious dilemma”.“What is more important to me is to stop that plant from poisoning us,” Taylor said. “It’s puzzling to me that this meeting will be held in New Orleans. Should we move all of the people out of Reserve to New Orleans? Maybe we should move the Denka plant to New Orleans too?”"
67,cancer,Can the new cervical cancer screen catch those most at risk?,"The way we screen for cervical cancer in Australia has changed dramatically, bringing us closer than ever to achieving eradication of the disease by 2035. Medical developments have made the test much more accurate, and testing less frequent - which may help those most at risk. Pap smears, the tests used from 1991 until the new screening was introduced in 2017, are at best a nuisance, at worst a traumatic ordeal. For many, that has meant foregoing them altogether. Only six out of 10 Australian women test at the required interval of every two years. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people, those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, and the economically disadvantaged are overrepresented in the number that don’t test. This has real consequences for those individuals. More than 80% of cervical cancer occurs in people who aren’t screened regularly or at all, and therefore aren’t warned early enough to prevent cancer developing. DIY makes testing an option for more people People can administer the new cervical screening test themselves, providing a more acceptable option for women, nonbinary or transgender people who don’t currently test and are most at risk. Cervical screening is a very intimate procedure. A speculum is inserted into the vagina and used to widen the opening, allowing the doctor or nurse to take a sample of cells from the cervix, which sits at the neck of the uterus. If you feel uncomfortable, you’re not alone. Dr Lara Roeske, a spokeswoman for the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP), says it can be overwhelming for some. “Fear, embarrassment, pain, or the perception of pain, are big barriers to getting tested,” she says. Also, cultural sensitivities, a history of abuse, trauma, and discrimination experienced by women and LGBTQI people can make what is an already a potentially difficult experience much worse. “That’s not a small group,” says Dr Roeske, a co-author of the National Cervical Screening Program guidelines. With the help of detailed instructions, people can perform the test alone, in a private room, at their GP or family planning clinic (it can’t be taken home).

If you haven’t heard of it, ask your GP Self-collection has been an option for Australians since December 2017. Anyone over the age of 30 who is not experiencing symptoms, is not pregnant, and whose last screening was meant to happen more than two years ago is eligible. Research has proved that the self-collection test is as good as a test done by a doctor or nurse. The evidence shows that the new test is something women want, with more than 85% of participants in an Australian pilot program taking it up when it was offered. But there’s still a surprising lack of general awareness.            “We would love more people to know about it and to talk to their GP or nurse about whether they’re eligible for self-collection,” says Dr Roeske, adding that GPs conduct more than 85% of cervical screening in Australia. “They’re a really powerful voice in getting women to participate. “If you decline the speculum exam, for whatever reason, your doctor or nurse can support you and explain how to take the test. It’s a life-saving pathway and it’s about access and equity. Those who don’t test for a whole host of reasons now have an option.” Safer than ever, more accurate and less often The new cervical screening test only needs to be done every five years, from the age of 25 until the age of 70-74. RACGP president Dr Harry Nespolon says: “It’s a better test done less often. And telling a woman she will only need to be tested every five years has meant more patients are willing to be screened.” The longer interval is possible because the new test looks for the human papilloma virus (HPV) strains that may eventually cause cervical cancer. The pap smear detects already existing abnormalities, and doctors need to make an educated assessment about the risk of cancer developing. Dr Roeske says: “Now we’re looking directly for cause, at the DNA of the HPV virus. That’s the big difference. “We test specifically for 14 types of HPV known to be causal and contribute to over 93% of cervical cancer in Australia. “If you don’t have any of those types, we can actually say your risk of developing cancer of the cervix or a significant lesion in the next five years after this test is extremely low. “You’re safer at five years with an HPV test than at two years after a pap smear.” The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) is Australia’s largest professional general practice organisation - our mission is to improve the health and wellbeing of all people in Australia by supporting GPs, general practice registrars and medical students."
68,cancer,Antibiotic use before cancer treatment cuts survival time – study,"Taking antibiotics in the month before starting immunotherapy dramatically reduces a cancer patient’s chances of survival, according to a small but groundbreaking study. Scientists at Imperial College London believe antibiotics strip out helpful bacteria from the gut, which weakens the immune system. This appears to make it less likely that immunotherapy drugs will boost the body’s cancer-fighting capability. In their study of nearly 200 cancer patients in two NHS hospitals, the researchers found that those who had taken broad-spectrum antibiotics for just a few days for common problems such as chest infections survived for a median of two months after immunotherapy, compared with 26 months for those who had not been on antibiotics. The substantial difference in survival, and clear evidence from CT scans that tumours grow more rapidly in those who have taken antibiotics, has led the researchers to call for more work to be done urgently to guide doctors. “Antibiotics clearly wipe out some of the gut microbiota,” said Dr David Pinato, from ICL’s department of surgery and cancer, who was one of the authors of the study published in the journal Jama Oncology. “If you have got a good microbiome, you are more likely to have educated your immune system to fight cancer better.” The results were the same no matter which antibiotics people were on or the type of cancer they had. In lung cancer, where chest infections are more common, median survival was 2.5 months in those who had been on antibiotics before starting the immunotherapy drugs, known as checkpoint inhibitors, versus 26 months in those who had not. In melanoma it was 3.9 versus 14 months, and in other tumours five weeks versus 11 months. The patients on antibiotics were not particularly ill. They were not on drips in hospital but tended to be taking a brief course of five to seven days as outpatients. Importantly, the outcomes and survival rates of patients who received antibiotics while they were on immunotherapy were not affected. It is already well known that some people respond much better to immunotherapy than others. In about 20% the cancer disappears completely and there can be hopes of a cure, but others do not do well. Scientists and commercial companies are hunting for reasons, looking at the type of tumour and its molecular traits. Pinato said the strong finding in their small observational study was unexpected. Others studies had suggested different factors that might reduce survival, “but this association seems to be pretty solid”, he said. It will not be the only reason for poor immunotherapy outcomes, but the authors say it is imperative that more research is done to establish how much of a factor it is. “It is important that patients who need antibiotics to treat bacterial infections receive the drugs they need,” said Pinato. “But these findings urge more care in the decision-making process for some patients. It raises questions of whether we need a higher threshold for antibiotic prescribing in cancer patients due to receive immunotherapy.” The health service is already under pressure to use antibiotics only when necessary, in order to conserve their power to kill dangerous strains of bacteria by avoiding resistance developing. “This probably adds a further layer of complexity to the idea of antibiotic stewardship,” said Pinato. The findings also provoke questions as to whether strengthening the gut microbiome might help the immune system fight cancer, an issue the ICL team now hope to explore."
69,cancer,Australia's high cancer survival rates attributed to earlier detection,"Australia has better cancer survival rates than other similar high-income countries, a global study has found. The study, published in the Lancet Oncology journal by the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership, reviewed 3.9m cancer cases from Australia, New Zealand, the UK, Norway, Ireland, Canada and Denmark and compared the one-year and five-year survival rates for seven types of cancer: bowel, oesophageal, pancreatic, stomach, rectum, lung and ovarian. Australia had the highest five-year survival rate in all but lung and ovarian cancer. The five-year survival rate in Australia for oesophageal cancer was 23.5%, stomach cancer 32.8%, colon cancer 70.8%, rectal cancer 70.8% and pancreatic 14.6%.   Related: Blood cancer taskforce seeks to tackle diseases that kill 20 Australians a day    All countries showed an improvement in one- and five-year survival rates over the data period, which extended from 1995 to 2015. The UK had the lowest five-year survival rate of five of the seven cancers, the exceptions being oesophageal (lowest in Denmark) and ovarian (lowest in Ireland). The chief executive of Cancer Council Australia, Prof Sanchia Aranda, said the higher survival rates could be attributed to earlier detection, which she said was due to the management of referral and screening services in Australia. Australia had the densest per capita availability of imaging services for the seven cancers represented in the study, Aranda said. “In Australia our primary care practitioners can refer patients for a full range of investigation, whereas in places like the UK that’s mediated through a secondary referral to a specialist,” she told Guardian Australia. “So we can get it done much earlier, and either rule out cancer or make a directed referral.” Australia’s split public and private health system also allows a doctor to refer a public patient to a private diagnostic service, with part of the cost of that service covered by Medicare. Aranda said that model took the burden off the public system and “evens out outcomes” but there was still a sharp divide in survival rates between wealthy people and those from lower socioeconomic groups.   Related: Most lung and bowel cancers being diagnosed too late, data shows    “People in the lowest socioeconomic group have a 37% higher mortality from cancer than people in the highest economic group,” she said. “So we shouldn’t be complacent about being number one. It should spur us on to make sure that those outcomes are equitable across their population.” People from lower socioeconomic groups had a lower rate of participation in national screening programs for breast, bowel and cervical cancer, Aranda said. Poorer people are 40% more likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer, and 2.5 times more likely to die from it. Among Indigenous communities, rates of mortality are 3.8 times higher. Only four in 10 eligible Australians (those aged 50 to 74) take part in the national bowel screening program. A 50% increase in participation would save an additional 84,000 lives through early diagnosis by 2040, Aranda said. The director of cancer medicine at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Prof Danny Rischin, said the study showed the Australian system was working relatively well to provide high quality care. But he urged caution in interpreting the data, because of classification differences between jurisdictions. “I think the important trend is that overall, looking at the seven countries and across the different cancers, we’re right up the top for all of them and if we’re not first we’re second,” he said. “So I think overall the results suggest that our system is working relatively well.”"
70,cancer,Contraception and lowering the risk of cancer,"In her article on the increasing use of contraception to control menstruation (Why more and more women are giving up periods, G2, 18 July), Nicola Davis only briefly alluded to one of the biggest cancer prevention stories that most people are unaware of. There is consistent evidence from large studies published over the last 15 years that women who used oral contraceptives have a 30-50% lower risk of ovarian cancer compared with women who have never used oral contraceptives. The level of protection increases with the length of time of use and continues for decades after the oral contraceptive is stopped. Similar, slightly smaller levels of cancer reduction are seen for womb cancer. In contrast, the increased risk of breast cancer associated with oral contraceptive use is much more widely known, even though the level of risk is modest and disappears five-10 years after stopping the pill. If more efforts can be made to extol the virtues of the pill as a cancer risk reduction agent, it is likely many more deaths from ovarian cancer can be prevented.Dr Marc TischkowitzReader in medical genetics, University of Cambridge • The recent government tender to provide free period products in schools is a worthy response to period poverty. But with the enormous amount of plastic period products thrown away daily in the UK, is this not an ideal opportunity to get an entire generation using sustainable products? Or to boost the agenda of plastic-free schools by 2022? So it’s hugely disappointing to see Procter &amp; Gamble, the largest maker of plastic period products, on the advisory board.

71,cancer,‘We’re calling this the death’s door tour’: cancer and the power of sport,"It’s June 2014, and James Howarth is in a waiting room at Orpington hospital. A few weeks earlier, he’d been in to see the doctor about his acid indigestion. Too much beer and curry, he reckoned. But there was something there, a growth, on his pancreas. Now he’s waiting for a Cat scan. He gets talking to another patient, a cockney, Paul, who says to him: “So what cancer you got, son?” and James says back: “No, not me, mate – they’re just eliminating things. It’s a cyst, a growth, a mass.” Paul blinks and looks at him. “Don’t be so fucking naive mate, this is a cancer ward.” And James sits there blank, and his mind fills with fear “like a lock as the gates are opened”. “Could be worse mate, you could support West Ham,” Paul tells him, “you don’t, do you?”   Related: England in ‘no rush’ to extend Eddie Jones’s contract, says RFU chief    I met James outside Yokohama International Stadium, a couple of hours before Wales’s Rugby World Cup semi-final against South Africa. I was doing vox pops about England’s win in the other semi, and he and his mate Nigel were wearing white tops. We spoke about how happy they were – “best day of our lives” they said, “we All-Blacked the All Blacks” – and how they’d consoled the Kiwi couple who’d been sitting next to them: “Now you know how we feel.” And then, as I was breaking away, James told me: “You know we’re calling this the death’s door tour because I was given six months to live.” I was still thinking about him when I got back home. So I found him, and phoned him. Paul the cockney was right. James has lymphoma. When they first diagnosed it, the consultant told him: “For the next six months, you have a new job, and that job is to fight cancer and fight for your life.” And James thought about his wife, and he thought about his three children, and he thought about his parents, he thought about all the big things we should be thinking about while we’re worrying about the little things we do think about. He thought about what he’d done, and what he wanted to do, and what he wanted to do was this: watch England win the Rugby World Cup, at home, in 2015. “I guess people deal with things in different ways,” he says, “someone who’s more sane than I am, more well-adjusted, might have goals to watch their children get married, but my kids are all so young, and I needed something much more short-term, and that’s what it was.”     Hathaway Academy headteacher James Howarth pictured before he left the school in 2017. Photograph: Courtesy of Hathaway Academy    Once, James had been a rugby player himself, “at a decent standard”. Then he’d become a PE teacher, at some hard schools, in Tottenham, in Canning Town, in Peckham, and, in the end, he became the head at the Hathaway Academy in Grays, Essex. “If I had a talent, it was to be able to relate to the most challenging children through sport,” he says. “My whole life has been built around sport and education, my friends are PE teachers, my wife is a PE teacher, I hired her when I was head of department, so our lives are totally entwined with sport.” James did better than England in 2015. He made it to the final. And then he started to think about what was next. For four years, James’s life, like those of so many of the other 363,000 people who are diagnosed with cancer in the UK each year, has been measured out in hospital visits. Some of them lasted hours. Some lasted weeks. He’s been in remission, and been rediagnosed, been in remission again, been rediagnosed again. On Facebook, you can watch the video of the last assembly James gave at Hathaway, when he finally quit teaching. He sounds urgent, almost angry. “Look at yourself, take action, do something,” he tells the children, “don’t end up running on the spot, don’t waste your time doing things that aren’t related to moving forwards.” No one ever told him he was crazy to think he could get to Japan in 2019, crazy to think he might see England win there, though, goodness knows, they must have thought it. James has lost a kidney, lost feeling in a leg, been through rare surgery, and an experimental course of drugs. He knows he will die with his cancer. Nine years ago, my own mother did too. The last trip we took together was to Japan, for my brother’s wedding. Talking to James, I remember how hard it was for her in that wheelchair, which she resented just as much as he does. “It’s not who I am.” “I think they know that I’m a belligerent bastard, and it wouldn’t matter what they told me,” James says. “My biggest worry was that England were going to lose to Tonga in the first group match, because I wasn’t getting there till the second week.” But England kept winning. Tonga, USA, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand. And here’s the thing. When, in the end, they lost, that was OK. Because the more they won, the less winning mattered. “I saw four of the 10 best games of rugby I’ve ever seen,” he says, “I saw the Scotland v Japan game with my mum. Our relationship had been really strained, and for us to be able to bond over a game of rugby, to get to a place I never thought we’d get back to … well, sport brings people together, doesn’t it? And that World Cup helped me re-establish my relationship with my parents, it gave me time to drink and be stupid with my best mate, and I saw the final with my kids and my wife.” When he got home, they told James the pain he’d been feeling in his spine was a fracture, caused by a new tumour pushing into the bone. “I’m already thinking about the Lions in 2021,” he says. I tell him I’ll see him there, outside Ellis Park. And I think that sport matters, and sport doesn’t matter at all, not in the ways we imagine.

72,cancer,UK still behind in cancer survival despite recent surge,"Cancer survival rates in the UK have improved markedly over recent decades but still lag behind those of comparable countries, a major research exercise has shown. The study looked at one-year and five-year survival of cancer patients in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway and the UK between 1995 and 2014. It found that while the chances of surviving cancer have improved in the UK, they have not caught up with other countries, which are also doing better thanks to new technologies and efforts to catch the disease at an earlier stage before it becomes hard to treat. Better surgery, in particular, led to a rise in five-year survival rates for colon cancer in the UK from 48% to 62%. One-year survival for lung, ovarian and oesophageal cancer all increased by about 15 percentage points over the 20 years. However, the UK fared worst of the countries examined in four of the seven cancers measured by five-year survival rates: rectal, pancreatic, lung and stomach.   Related: Australia high cancer survival rates attributed to earlier detection    John Butler, a co-author of the study and clinical adviser to Cancer Research UK, said: “There isn’t one specific reason why survival in the UK has improved – it’s a combination of many different factors. Over the last 20 years we’ve seen improvements in cancer planning, development of national cancer strategies and the rollout of new diagnostic and treatment services. “For lung, ovarian and oesophageal cancer in particular, survival has increased largely because the quality of surgery has radically improved, and more surgery is taking place than before. More people are being looked after by specialist teams, rather than surgeons who aren’t experts in that area. “But while we’re still researching what can be done to close the survival gap between countries, we know continued investment in early diagnosis and cancer care plays a big part. Despite our changes we’ve made slower progress than others.” Cancer Research UK, which helped fund the study known as the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership, said more NHS cancer staff were needed if the UK was to catch up. “More people than ever before are surviving cancer thanks to research and targeted improvements in care. But while we’re on the right track, the numbers show we can certainly do better,” said Sara Hiom, the charity’s director of early diagnosis. “We will not see the necessary improvements in diagnosis and access to treatment unless we have enough of the right staff across our NHS. Cancer Research UK has been calling for staff shortages to be addressed because, quite simply, it will give people a better chance of surviving their cancer. “If we are to achieve world-class cancer outcomes in the UK, then we need to see comparable investment in the NHS and the systems and innovations that support it. It’s never been a more crucial time for the government to put new money where it matters.” The study, published in the Lancet Oncology journal, looked at 3.9 million cancer cases across the seven countries. The researchers say the variations between countries are probably mostly to do with how early the cancer is diagnosed, whether the patient receives prompt treatment and whether they have other health problems at the same time. Australia, Norway and Canada generally had better survival rates than New Zealand, Denmark, Ireland and the UK. In the most recent years with data available, between 2010 and 2014, Australia topped the five-year survival league table in five out of seven cancers – oesophageal (23.5%), stomach (32.8%), colon (70.8%), rectal (70.8%) and pancreatic (14.6%). In the latter two cancers, the UK had the lowest survival rates over five years, at 62.1% and 7.9%. The UK was also last in lung cancer (14.7%), in which Canada did best (21.7%), and stomach cancer (20.8%). Ovarian cancer survival was highest in Norway (46.2%) and lowest in Ireland (36%).   graphic   The lead author, Dr Melina Arnold of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, said: “The improvements in cancer survival observed are likely a direct consequence of healthcare reforms and technological advances that enable earlier diagnosis, more effective and tailored treatment and better patient management. “Improvements in surgical techniques and new guidelines including preoperative radiotherapy as well as better diagnosis and scanning, enabling better staging of cancers and selection for targeted therapies, have all improved patient outcomes.” The trajectory over the two decades shows the UK improving but failing to catch other countries that are also improving. However, NHS England rejected the findings, claiming things have changed. “In the five years since the study’s research ends, cancer survival has actually hit a record high, thanks to improvements in NHS cancer services, including the introduction of revolutionary treatments like proton beam therapy and immunotherapy,” said a spokesperson. “The NHS long-term plan will build on this progress by ramping up action to spot more cancers at the earliest possible stage when the chance of survival is higher, saving tens of thousands more lives every year.”"
73,cancer,'Evil economics': William Barber condemns proposed plastics facility in Cancer Alley,"For the second time in two months the moral revival campaigner and civil rights leader the Rev William Barber has visited an area of toxic pollution in Louisiana known colloquially as “Cancer Alley” as he places the fight for clean air there at the centre of a national protest movement. The North Carolina-based activist, thrust on to the national stage after the success of the Moral Mondays protests in his home state, joined a group of local demonstrators in St James parish, between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, on Wednesday as they rallied against a proposed plastics manufacturing facility nearby.    series box   The sprawling, $9.4bn site in the parish’s fifth ward, pushed by the Taiwanese petrochemicals giant Formosa, would consist of 14 separate plants across 2,300 acres of land and, if approved, would be allowed to roughly double the amount of toxic emissions in the parish from 1.6m lb to 3.2m. The proposed construction, known as the Sunshine Project, has won the support of local and state officials, including Louisiana’s Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, with the promise of 1,200 permanent jobs as well as thousands of temporary construction jobs. It would be built in the parish’s fifth district, which is 85% African American. On Wednesday evening Barber argued the project was backed by “evil economics”. “It comes down to greed,” Barber said. “You could take an area like Cancer Alley and focus on things that would fix the environment and put people to work cleaning up the mess. But it’s almost as if people decide ‘we just want money’. And then they decide who can we make the money off of that will give us the least resistance. It’s evil economics.” Formosa did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Some wearing @ExtinctionR stickers: pic.twitter.com/gUncJ1tsVS&mdash; Oliver Laughland (@oliverlaughland) October 23, 2019    Barber last visited the region in July as part of a series of Guardian co-sponsored town hall events in New Orleans and Reserve, which is the focus of a year-long series, Cancer Town. Reserve, in neighbouring St John the Baptist parish, has the highest risk of cancer due to airborne toxicity anywhere in the US, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The primary cause of this elevated risk is emissions from a synthetic rubber plant, the Pontchartrain Works facility, operated by the Japanese chemicals giant Denka. The plant is the only place in America to emit the compound chloroprene, listed by the EPA as a “likely carcinogen”. Earlier in the month Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren released a detailed environmental justice platform which referenced pollution in Reserve and Cancer Alley. On Wednesday, Barber said he had been in contact with a number of the leading Democratic candidates, including Warren and the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, renewing his call for them to visit polluted sites in southern Louisiana. Barber briefly broke off from an interview with the Guardian to call Warren’s personal cellphone, leaving a voicemail: “We really need to bring the campaign through Cancer Alley. We need to bring worldwide and national attention to what’s going on here. And how it is the direct relationship between policy and justice, racism and economic greed,” he said.     “If I die, I’m going to die standing. If I die, I’m going to die speaking the truth.” @RevDrBarber preaching in full flow at the Mount Calvary Baptist Church: pic.twitter.com/sWrfqplEC6&mdash; Oliver Laughland (@oliverlaughland) October 24, 2019    The march on Wednesday was part of a two-week campaign throughout the region, which began last Tuesday. Numbers have ebbed and flowed over the days of activism as organizers hope for a large turnout at the governor’s mansion in Baton Rouge next Wednesday. Barber will return to the city for that march. “If you go into these parishes where [the petrochemical industry] already exists, people understand there is a problem, so I think we have public opinion on our side,” said Anne Rolfes, executive director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, a not-for-profit environmental justice group involved in the protests. “The gap that we have is people believing they can do something about it and I think that part of this is building excitement, building camaraderie, and then really looking at our strategies and our tactical plans for succeeding,” she said. Barber said his continued visits to the region were having a profound effect on his campaigning. “When I hear the deep faith of the people here. When I see people like Robert Taylor [a leading campaigner in Reserve], who could be my grandfather, and he’s standing up with power in his voice and commitment in his body, his heart, you know, that is inspiring. I’m humbled that they would even call and say: ‘Would you do something with us?’” "
74,cancer,"Neglected NHS cancer hospital is unfit for purpose, says report","An NHS cancer hospital has such crumbling buildings, out-of-date equipment and staffing problems that patients’ safety and quality of care are at risk, a bombshell report for health service bosses has warned. Patients at the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre who are acutely unwell or dying are receiving substandard care because it lacks the medical expertise and facilities needed to manage them properly, and its services need to be moved, an inquiry has found. Mount Vernon in Hillingdon, north-west London, is one of the NHS’s specialist cancer hospitals, along with London’s Royal Marsden and the Christie in Manchester. The impending loss of most or all of Mount Vernon’s services will be of concern to Boris Johnson, as his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency is nearby. Voters in the seat are among the 2 million people in London, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Berkshire for whom Mount Vernon is their nearest specialist cancer centre. However, despite its decrepit physical infrastructure, it is not one of the six hospitals the prime minister this week said would be rebuilt over the next five years with a £2.7bn injection of NHS capital funding. The 117-year-old London hospital is so dilapidated and short of doctors and nurses that it cannot provide modern cancer care or even basic elements of treatment such as consultants undertaking daily ward rounds, new inpatients being reviewed within 14 hours of arrival and rapid access to diagnostic testing and their results. The group of experts who undertook the urgent review on behalf of NHS bosses have concluded that Mount Vernon has been neglected for so long that it can no longer operate safely as an important regional centre of cancer care, is unviable and as a result its services need to be moved and rebuilt from scratch elsewhere. “Maintaining safety of patients cannot be guaranteed in the near future. Status quo is not an option. There is a need for urgent action. Current estate is not fit for purpose, particularly ward buildings for acutely unwell and end of life inpatients,” the report says. Leaking roofs have forced Mount Vernon’s management to move some services from one part of the hospital to another, the 34-page report reveals. The wards containing its 37 inpatient beds – where people are treated for complications of cancer or recover from radiotherapy or chemotherapy or are in their last days – are in “very poor” condition. And its lack of an intensive care or high dependency unit and operating theatres means that “large numbers” of patients have to be transferred from Mount Vernon to other hospitals because it is unable to look after the very sick. “Much of the existing estate used by MVCC is dilapidated and not fit for purpose,” the report says. An “urgent backlog maintenance of existing clinical facilities” needs to be tackled. Its lack of staff has become “critical” and means that some patients are not getting helped by a nurse who specialises in their form of cancer. Shortages are being exacerbated by an exodus of experienced doctors and nurses. The report found: “Staff losses are impacting upon the service. There are additional clinical risks such as the backlog of patient letters and notes as a result of inadequate administrative support. “Recruitment and retention of expert staff is an increasing problem and is becoming critical.” In addition, personnel “are, in the main, demoralised and frustrated” over the hospital’s uncertain future. It is thought to be the first time in the NHS’s 71-year history that a major facility specialising in the country’s second biggest killer disease has been deemed to pose a risk to patients and been declared unfit for purpose. Cancer charities said the hospital’s shortcomings were “deeply worrying” and reflect the serious workforce shortages and reliance on old equipment that are increasingly common in NHS cancer services after almost a decade of austerity funding of the health service. “Time after time we’ve heard about staff shortages causing crises in NHS cancer services, and this is yet more evidence of the unbearable pressure on the system,” said Matt Case, Cancer Research UK’s policy manager. “Recent government commitments to investing in NHS buildings and equipment are a welcome first step, but must be met by significant investment in cancer staff, or stories like this will continue to emerge and cancer patients will not receive the care that they deserve.” Prof Nick Slevin, a consultant clinical oncologist at the Christie hospital, led the clinical advisory panel of experts which undertook the urgent review in May at the request of NHS England’s east of England region. Slevin states in the report that it was undertaken because “acute support services have been progressively depleted on the site over many years such that there is current and increasing concern regarding patient safety”. He adds: “Services continue to be provided within very poor quality accommodation with much equipment reaching the end of its life without a replacement plan.” For example, one linear accelerator (linacs) machine used to deliver radiotherapy has been temporarily upgraded so the hospital can continue using it because it cannot afford to buy a new one. Other problems highlighted by the panel’s report include:  Information technology and electronic patient record systems are so poor that they constitute “a clinical risk”. Staff provide excellent care in difficult circumstances but are struggling due to “excess workload”. Doctors cannot access the results of CT and MRI scans out of hours. Delays of up to six weeks in typing up letters detailing patients’ latest condition means that nurses staffing Mount Vernon’s 24-hour telephone chemotherapy advice line may inadvertently give wrong advice.  The experts have recommended that Mount Vernon is either replaced in full beside an acute hospital, or that that happens but some radiotherapy and chemotherapy services remain on the existing site. With Mount Vernon’s days numbered, three major London NHS trusts – the Marsden, University College London Hospitals and Imperial College Healthcare – as well as Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge – are interested in its replacement being built on their site. Whichever gets it will take over running it from East and North Hertfordshire trust. Gwyneth Tyler, Macmillan Cancer Support’s head of services for south and east England, said: “The findings from the recent review into the Mount Vernon Cancer centre are deeply worrying. People living with cancer deserve access to the best possible care from the moment they are diagnosed and cancer centres cannot provide this without capital investment in their infrastructure and workforce.” An NHS spokesperson said: “The review of Mount Vernon Cancer Centre is ongoing to ensure the service is able to respond to the significant advances in cancer treatment over recent decades. This includes identifying a specialist cancer provider to run the centre.”"
75,cancer,Mark Radcliffe ‘surprised’ to lose BBC show during cancer,"Mark Radcliffe has said he was surprised to be bumped from his BBC 6 Music afternoon show while undergoing cancer treatment at the end of last year. The radio presenter’s programme with Stuart Maconie was moved to Saturday and Sunday mornings in order to give Shaun Keaveny the 1pm weekday slot, as part of a reshuffle in which Lauren Laverne became the station’s breakfast show host. “We felt … surprised,” Radcliffe told the Radio Times. “And disappointed. Some of the things [BBC management] have done mystify me still, but actually, in terms of my health, it’s probably better not to have to do three hours a day, five days a week.” Radcliffe, 61, agreed to stay with Maconie even as the show dropped from five to two days a week – a move he said was “like renewing our marriage vows”. The Cheshire-based Radcliffe was diagnosed with head and neck cancer at the end of last year, requiring the removal of tumours from his neck and mouth. He is now in remission. The illness forced him to spend several months off air, during which time Maconie broadcast on his own. Radcliffe, who is promoting his new book, Crossroads, on moments that changed music, told the magazine that he had become more upbeat after his illness. “People always say: ‘You’ve got to stay positive.’ Easier said than done. But when it comes to the crunch, what’s the alternative? “Everybody sneers at John Lennon, imagining there are no possessions while he lives in his big, white house. I found myself being quite kind to him [in the book], because surely part of life is about thinking: we can get through this. It made me a more positive person … At first, I was a bit like a religious zealot. People would say: ‘I’m not sure about this new Radcliffe, where’s the cynical one?” BBC 6 Music reaches 2.3 million listeners a week, according to the latest audience figures, more than tune in to Radio 3. The broadcaster also said he looked back on his ill-fated brief stint on the Radio 1 breakfast show during the 1990s as half of Mark and Lard as a “blip” and suggested he was much happier with the 6 Music show and his Folk Show on Radio 2: “I’ve never been a big deal – more of a medium deal.”"
76,cancer,"With pancreatic cancer, what Stephen needs is legalised cannabis","I was lying face down when I first heard about Stephen Schulman. I’d been feeling sorry for myself, complaining of an aching wrist and back – the vestiges of an age-inappropriate roller-skating accident - while my massage therapist Elisa worked to soothe my pain. Eventually, our conversation turned to her friend Stephen. At only 41, just months after marrying the love of his life, Stephen had gone to the doctor complaining of stomach pains and the inability to keep anything down. He re-emerged with a diagnosis: stage-3 pancreatic cancer, inoperable due to a very large tumor wrapping itself around a major artery in his abdomen. In essence, a death sentence. Elisa had been buying Stephen sublingual CBD oil – $89 for one ounce – because it proved to be the only thing effectively alleviating the tingling and numbness that had recently consumed his fingers and toes. He and his husband Wade’s savings had been bled dry by their $2,400-a-month insurance premium plus general expenses. Stephen is unable to work since his life has become a blur of excruciating pain, treatments, hope, fear and heavy doses of opioids like fentanyl and oxycodone.     A magnet given to Stephen by his friend Becky sits amongst only a portion of the medication on his bedside table. ‘I keep it there,’ Stephen says, ‘to remind me to keep going.’ Photograph: Ali Smith/The Guardian    Stephen first heard about the reported pain relief benefits of medical marijuana and CBD oil for cancer patients a year into his treatment. When he asked his doctors about applying for a medical marijuana card, their reluctance confused him. Still, he persisted and when he started using both, he found they controlled his symptoms as well or, in some cases, better than opioids. He also found out that no insurance company covers their high costs. As Elisa told me Stephen’s story, I considered how the small discomforts I’d come in with made it harder for me to get around in the day or to sleep well at night. How they made me feel irritable and fragile. And how I could pay a negligible amount of money to a lovely woman to help soothe them for me. My ailments were absolutely nothing by comparison with Stephen’s, yet what he needs is elusive at best, prohibited at worst. Politicians have been embroiled in contentious debates for years about the morality and logistics of legalizing medical marijuana despite reputable studies, like the Rand study, which supports its efficacy. In the meantime, people like Stephen suffer. I decided to document Stephen’s life because his story had something valuable to remind us all about the gap between the abstract moralizing of politicians and the needs of the people they represent. These pictures were taken between January and August 2019.   .   Wade is a freelance hairstylist. Once in a while, he sits Stephen down in the chair in his home salon and treats him to a haircut, shave and facial mask.   .   Stephen remembers clearly what it felt like to be diagnosed: “It just hits you like a ton of bricks: ‘Everything is about to change.’ Your life is going to be about doing chemo, radiation, things you wouldn’t normally do and it’s going to be a hard, uphill battle.”     Stephen and Wade Photograph: Ali Smith/The Guardian     .   Wade adds Osmolite formula, a therapeutic nutrition for patients with increased calorie and protein needs, to a drip every other night to help Stephen maintain a healthy weight. The procedure takes eight hours and is very uncomfortable. Lack of appetite and nausea leading to unhealthy weight loss are common for pancreatic patients. The use of medical marijuana has helped Stephen greatly with these symptoms.     “We have to lean on each other every single day.” Stephen says of his relationship. “Trust one another. Care for each other and be up front about how we’re doing and how we’re feeling every single day. There’s no way I would have been able to get through this diagnosis without Wade. I appreciate him more every day. I know that sounds corny, but it’s true.” Photograph: Ali Smith/The Guardian    Artist Jason Naylor, whose self-described mission is to “spread color and positivity across the globe”, heard about Stephen’s plight through social media and made him the “Love” painting, which he hand-delivered to the couple, that hangs above Stephen and Wade’s bed. Overwhelmed by medical expenses, Stephen and Wade accepted the offer of a friend to set up a GoFundMe page for them. “We have to lean on each other, trust one another, and be up front about how we’re doing and feeling every single day,” Stephen says of his relationship. “There’s no way I would have been able to get through this diagnosis without Wade. I appreciate him more every day. I know that sounds corny, but it’s true.”     Clyde, one of the couple’s two cats, looks on as Stephen tries on his kickboxing gloves.

But insurance has, so far, refused to pay for it or the chemotherapy I’ll need beforehand, and it is astronomically expensive.”     “It makes me smile a little to wear fun, colorful socks,” Stephen says in reference to his “cock socks.” Photograph: Ali Smith/The Guardian    “It makes me smile a little to wear fun, colorful socks,” Stephen says in reference to the “cock socks” he wears to physical therapy.     “I think it’s funny,” Stephen remarks, “that in America you’re able to buy alcohol, which is known to cause all these problems, but CBD oil and medical marijuana are more regulated and looked down upon. It’s sad because they’ve definitely helped me immensely.” Photograph: Joshua Bright/The Guardian    “I think it’s funny,” Stephen remarks, “that in America you’re able to buy alcohol, which is known to cause all these problems, but CBD oil and medical marijuana are more regulated and looked down upon.

Dispensaries can’t distribute edibles because it’s much harder to control the doses a patient receives in them. Every dose at Columbia Care New York is consistent and titrated, meaning it’s increased, if need be, slowly over time.   dr reed   Tricia Reed, PharmD, Columbia Care New York’s lead pharmacist, describes the purported benefits of some of their products. “High THC products are good for nausea, vomiting and severe pain, giving more of an opiate-type pain relief. THC is a good muscle relaxer and helps with sleep. CBD is a great anti-inflammatory, works well for nerve pain, and is an anti-convulsant so it’s good for seizures. Every dose has to deliver the exact milligram per milliliter as prescribed. Each time you take an inhalation from the vapor, it gives you a specific mg.”     When a patient visits Columbia Care for the first time, they meet with a pharmacist who takes them through a full consultation to determine what products they may respond to best. While THC and CBD have been used for thousands of years, we now know there are close to 100 lesser known cannabinoids that technology has given scientists the ability to detect and extract. Columbia Care’s pharmacists like Dr. Reed are highly knowledgeable in order to ensure that patient safety comes first. Photograph: Joshua Bright/The Guardian    When a patient visits Columbia Care for the first time, they meet with a pharmacist who takes them through a full consultation to determine what products they may respond to best. “In the higher-THC products,” Reed explains, “there can be a euphoric feeling which might not be so bad for patients going through a hard time. It’s similar to the side-effects you’d get from other meds like Valium. I encourage patients to think of it that way. It’s just a side-effect similar to those of other medications they may have already taken. There is still that sense of taboo or stigma that goes along with marijuana. A lot of what we’ve been trying to do is to de-stigmatize it. Rosemary Mazanet, an oncologist by original training, is chief scientific officer for Columbia Care. “When I think about the disconnect between the enormous promise that cannabis products bring and the fact that there’s such an air about it that makes it tawdry, it comes down to the fact that it’s federally illegal.”     Rosemary Mazanet is an oncologist by original training, and now Chief Scientific Officer for Columbia Care. Photograph: Joshua Bright/The Guardian    She adds: “In the state of Massachusetts, where I live, the Massachusetts Medical Society sent a letter to doctors stating that they could recommend cannabis when it was made legal there, but that they were at risk for losing their license. ‘We don’t know what will happen, but the federal government may take action,’ the letter essentially said. We do know that physicians at any hospital that’s federally funded will be terminated if they recommend medical marijuana to a patient. That’s made physicians understandably very reluctant. I do get angry because this should be easy and it’s not. We need to fix it!”     “Cancer is a mind fuck,” Wade asserts. “You’re hit with devastating and debilitating news that your loved one’s life has an expiration date and you realize your own powerlessness and that begins to take its toll on your spirit. All you can do is try to remember that love is the greatest gift you can give anyone.

I have no other choice.”"
77,cancer,Genetic testing kits 'may wrongly reassure those at risk of cancer',"Consumer genetic tests could be giving false reassurance to those at heightened risk of cancers, according to findings presented at an international conference this week. The study, by clinical genetic testing company Invitae, revealed that tests for breast and bowel cancer risk by direct-to-consumer companies such as 23andMe give negative results to the vast majority of those carrying DNA mutations in the genes under investigation. “These tests should not be taken at face value at all, whether they are positive or negative,” said Edward Esplin from Invitae ahead of the annual meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics in Houston, Texas. “The data really underscores that there needs to be increased awareness that results from this type of screening may not be wrong but they’re woefully incomplete.” The research also showed that those from Asian and African-American backgrounds were more likely to carry mutations that were not designed to be detected by the consumer tests. The research focused on DNA-based tests relating to breast, ovarian and bowel cancer that were recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The tests operate by a subject sending a DNA swab in the post for analysis and then receiving results with information about how their genetics could influence their health. In the case of breast and ovarian cancer, the FDA has approved a screening test for three specific mutations on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are most common in people of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. However, these mutations are rare in people from other backgrounds. Similarly, for bowel cancer, 23andMe offers FDA-authorised tests for two mutations, which are most common among individuals of northern European ancestry. The company explains the limitations of these tests to consumers and on its website. Esplin said that despite this, consumers could be wrongly reassured by a negative result. The study analysed the DNA of 270,806 patients who had been referred by healthcare providers for testing of the MUTYH gene, and 119,328 who had been referred for BRCA1/2 genetic testing. It showed that for both tests, the majority of those carrying mutations would not be spotted, which Invitae describes as a “clinical false-negative result”. For MUYTH, 40% of individuals with mutations in both copies of their MUTYH genes – consistent with an almost 100% lifetime risk of bowel cancer – had different mutations to those screened for in the FDA-approved test. This figure rose to 100% for those from Asian backgrounds and 75% for African-Americans. For BRCA genes, 94% of non-Ashkenazi Jewish individuals and 19% of those of Ashkenazi heritage had a mutation that would be missed. Again, the figures were highest for those of Asian (98%) and African-American (99%) ancestry. “It’s performing a disproportionate disservice to individuals of these underrepresented groups,” Esplin said. “A clinical false-negative result can be incorrectly reassuring, excluding a patient from receiving the preventive care they need based on their risk,” he added. “It could be the difference between preventing cancer and developing cancer.” In response to the findings, 23andMe said in a statement: “The claims made by a competitor that we are returning ‘clinical false negatives’ is incorrect and a false characterisation of 23andMe’s test. Our test is extremely accurate. As part of the FDA authorisation process we’ve demonstrated over 99% accuracy for the variants we test for in our health product.” The company said it makes clear to customers that it tests only for certain genetic variants and that customers should not forgo any recommended testing based on 23andMe results. “23andMe is not a diagnostic test,” the company said. “If an individual has a family history of cancer or other indications for clinical testing we always recommend consulting a healthcare provider first.” Prof Anneke Lucassen, a clinical geneticist at the University of Southampton, said that, in her experience, non-specialists would be likely to wrongly interpret negative results as an “all-clear”. “I do think the ‘false-negative’ rate is an issue, not necessarily through the companies’ fault but through low general awareness,” she said. “Most people who come to clinic ask: ‘Have I got the gene for breast cancer?’ and imagine it’s a single test, not that the test involves looking through around 20,000 letters of the genetic code to see if any one of them might be different.”"
78,cancer,£55m Anglo-US research alliance to boost early cancer detection rates,"Efforts to improve early cancer detection rates have been given a boost with a new major international alliance of researchers backed by £55m of funding. The unit will bring together six universities and charities across the UK and the US to share expertise, ideas and resources to increase the scale of research. The hope is to improve understanding of how cancer arises, develop tests and imaging techniques and design clinical trials to speedily bring innovations to the public. The earlier cancers are detected, the easier they can be treated and the better the chance of survival. At present, there are routine screening programmes in the UK for bowel, breast and cervical cancer, while targeted screening for lung cancer is being piloted. But while experts say these programmes save lives there is more to be done: current methods do not pick up all cases while for many cancers no screening technologies exist. “There’s still a major unmet need,” said Prof David Crosby, head of early detection research at Cancer Research UK, which is part of the alliance and is contributing £40m over the next five years. “In fact around half of cancers are still diagnosed at an advanced stage and the outcomes for those people are very poor.”  The £55m collaboration, dubbed the International Alliance for Cancer Early Detection (ACED), will also delve into knotty issues such as why many people skip screening appointments, and explore how new techniques can be made easily accessible. “With this alliance one of the things that we are very committed to is taking things all the way through from the bench to the bedside,” said Prof Rebecca Fitzgerald of the University of Cambridge, another of the UK institutions. There are even hopes it might one day be possible to offer a tailored approach to prevention whether through surgery or drugs.“There could eventually be drugs that we can give you that nip things in the bud because we can predict what is likely to go wrong in you,” said Crosby. The alliance is looking to develop simple detection techniques based on blood, urine or even nasal swab samples, as well as working with sophisticated imaging techniques such as hyperpolarised MRI – this allows researchers to investigate how cancer cells generate energy and is showing promise in prostate cancer research. Prof Robert Bristow of the University of Manchester, which is also part of the alliance, said another project involves collecting pre-cancerous cells, immune cells and blood vessel cells from individuals with tissues at high risk of cancer and 3D printing them. This will allow scientists to change conditions such as oxygen levels or nutrients to explore what might trigger cells to become cancerous – potentially shedding light on the characteristics of early cancers and even ways to prevent them. “In a human being we never get to see a cancer being born,” said Crosby, adding that established cancers might behave differently to early ones. “If you can essentially give birth to a cancer in a piece of synthetic human tissue in the lab, you can see what it is like on day one and hopefully be able to detect and intercept it,” he said. The researchers acknowledged that some routine screening programmes, including for breast cancer, have been criticised for over diagnosis – a situation where cancers that would not have caused harm are found, often leading to unnecessary treatment. However, they say the alliance will explore techniques that will be better able to find problematic cancers, and distinguish them from those that are harmless – such as the use of MRI imaging to detect prostate cancer rather than traditional biopsies. They are also looking at ways to identify people at high or low risk of certain cancers, meaning those at high risk could be offered more frequent screening than those at low risk.   Related: No screening is better for women with low breast cancer risk, finds study    The announcement of the alliance comes just weeks after it was found that cancer survival rates in the UK, while improving, are lagging behind those of other countries such as Norway, Canada and Australia. Sara Hiom, Cancer Research UK’s director of early diagnosis, said that is down to a number of reasons, including a lack of diagnostic staff that delays diagnosis. “GPs need faster access to smarter tests, so that they only need to send people at the highest risk of cancer to hospital for further investigation,” she said. “ACED will aim to fast-track development of these types of tests and get them into clinical practice as soon as it is safe to do so.”"
79,cancer,Will a push for plastics turn Appalachia into next ‘Cancer Alley’?,"Construction cranes climb into the sky and sprawl across the massive petrochemical facility that will turn a byproduct of fracked gas into plastic on the banks of the Ohio River, just outside Pittsburgh. 
Even at a distance, from the car park of a cancer treatment centre on a nearby hilltop, Royal Dutch Shell’s 386-acre site is a behemoth. It will anchor yet more gas, plastics and chemicals infrastructure in the tristate region of Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. 
The plant would solidify demand for fracked natural gas and the ethane that comes with it out of the ground. It would make 1.6m tons of plastic and 2.2m tons of globe-heating carbon dioxide annually – roughly the same amount the city of Pittsburgh is trying to eliminate. The facility would also release hundreds of tons of toxic compounds into the air. 
As global demand for plastics grows, the buildout of this industry threatens US progress on the climate crisis and clean air. 
Opponents say the vast plastics industry will prolong fracking, even after power companies shift further towards renewable power, such as solar and wind. “To me, it’s so obvious that they are trying to lock us into fossil fuels,” said Terrie Baumgardner, a member of the Beaver County Marcellus Awareness Community. 
At a time when scientists warn humans must stop pulling fossil fuels out of the ground and spewing plastics into the environment, natural gas drilling is booming in Appalachia and the ethane-to-plastics industry there is just getting started.

In a tall office building on a hazy Pittsburgh day, Matt Mehalik, the executive director of a public health collaboration called the Breathe Project, slammed his hand on a table. “This region has been down this path before and we should know better,” he said. “I grew up in Pittsburgh at the time the steel industry unravelled. It has taken 30 years to recover.”  
Dangerous air 
Opposed residents have myriad concerns. The Shell ethane facility, or “cracker” plant, would use extreme heat to turn ethane into ethylene, which becomes the polyethylene in plastic bottles, bags and food packaging. It will be fed by thousands of fracking wells that dot local communities, including next to day-care facilities and school bus stops.

Residents opposing the ever-growing expansion say they worry about illnesses and dozens of cases of rare cancers they never saw in generations past. 
Pittsburgh already has some of the most dangerous air in America. The city received a double-F rating from the American Lung Association for smog and particle pollution from fossil fuels. And Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh, has ranked in the top 2% for cancer risks from air pollution. 
And a report by the Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania last year found that since 2007, companies profiting from fracking had spent nearly $70m lobbying the state government, in part to insist the method was safe. 
“Fracking money has undermined the voice of the people in comparison to the voice of the desire for fracking in the region,” said Mark Dixon, a film-maker and activist. 
The pro-business group the Allegheny Conference on Community Development has boasted the plastics boom could turn Appalachia into a petrochemical hub similar to the Gulf Coast. But there, Louisiana residents have long tried to draw attention to the stretch of communities between New Orleans and Baton Rouge known as “Cancer Alley”.

The conference argues its goal is to attract business and that government regulators are responsible for keeping residents healthy. A spokesman, Philip Cynar, said: “We have to think about the holistic approach … we can do a lot more for the overall benefit of the region if we have a good economy.” 
The fear of health risks is misplaced, according to Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. In consultation with US regulators, it approved Shell’s air pollution plan in 2015. Allegheny County’s health department considered the effects of the plant’s releases of benzene, toluene, hexane, formaldehyde and ammonia – which cause cancer and other serious health problems. The department found the levels would be “well below the health-based risk value” for an individual. 
Shell has said it designed the facility to “obtain the lowest achievable emissions.” 
Aside from air pollution, the Shell plant will be as bad for global heating as putting a further 424,000 cars on the road each year. “It’s a huge paradox,” said Grant Ervin, Pittsburgh’s chief resilience officer. Oil and gas jobs pay well, even for people straight out of high school, he said. But the climate crisis puts humans “at the precipice of a public health disaster.” 
Job creation 
Republicans and Democrats have supported the Shell plant, saying it will bring work to an area that has been hit hard by a downturn in US-made steel and coal. 
Shell says it will create 6,000 construction jobs in the short term and 600 over the longer term. It is unclear exactly how many will go to locals. State lawmakers offered the company a $1.65bn, 25-year tax cut, the biggest break in Pennsylvania history. 
Republican legislators have proposed a package of bills to encourage the natural gas industry, including by speeding the process for permitting projects and providing huge financial incentives. 
Pennsylvania’s governor, the Democrat Tom Wolf, inherited the project from a Republican predecessor and now supports it.  
But the facility and others like it are antithetical to Wolf’s plans to shrink the climate footprint of Pennsylvania, the country’s fourth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide. He wants to cut carbon pollution in Pennsylvania 26% by 2025, and 80% by 2050. His Department of Environmental Protection said the state is requiring the plant to reduce its climate footprint as possible “to help ensure that economic development and environmental protection can go hand in hand.”

Pittsburgh’s mayor, the Democrat Bill Peduto, famously challenged Trump on climate change, saying Pittsburgh would abide by an international pledge to limit heat-trapping pollution, even if Trump would not. 
But Peduto has stayed silent about the plant. 
Construction continues 
Hailed by Barack Obama as a “bridge fuel”, natural gas has become a nightmare for climate advocates. It has spurred a transition from coal, which emits twice as much carbon dioxide. But the bridge does not seem to be ending, and the natural gas production process leaks methane, a potent greenhouse gas. 
The industry has continued to build wells, plants and pipelines – about 27% of natural gas in the US comes from the Marcellus and Utica shales under Appalachia. By 2040, the area will produce 37% of the country’s natural gas, according to the data firm IHS Markit. 
Appalachia has wet gas, meaning it produces both the methane mixture that is used for power and stovetops and natural gas liquids, including ethane and propane. Drillers want a local market at which to sell them all.

Of the Democratic frontrunners for president, senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have pledged to ban fracking. Joe Biden, the former vice-president, has not. 
But the Trump administration is supporting the build-out. 
Ken Humphreys, a senior adviser for regional economic development at the US Department of Energy, said: “Broadly this is about creating the conditions for private capital to flow into the region.  
Between 2018 and 2040, the US’s capacity for making ethylene and intermediate petrochemical products is expected to nearly double. 
The energy department argues that global demand for plastic is rising, and it will either be produced in the US or in countries with more lax environmental standards. 
Humphreys said there were 7,500 businesses within 300 miles of Pittsburgh, employing 900,000 people to make products that incorporated petrochemicals – most of which came from the Gulf Coast. Producing plastic locally would be more efficient, the department said. 
Rare cancers 
In Washington County, Pennsylvania, south-west of Pittsburgh, fracking well pads sit alongside neighbourhoods. One, called a super-frack pad because of its dozens of wellheads, sits in a valley next to the former coal community of Marianna. 
A school bus stop overlooks the site and the children who wait there each morning live in brick homes that were built for coalminers and then abandoned. 
Four counties in south-western Pennsylvania have been afflicted by a rash of rare cancers, including 27 cases of Ewing sarcoma over 10 years in a population of about 750,000. The bone cancer usually occurs in children and young adults. 
A retired paediatrician, Ned Ketyer, said: “Ewing sarcoma is a nightmare for the families that are given that diagnosis, and certainly for the patients and also for the physicians that diagnose it. It starts very quietly but by the time the diagnosis is made it has deepened and spread.” 
There are dozens of other rare cancer cases in the area too. The Pennsylvania Department of Health studied rates of the disease in two school districts and said there was no evidence of a cluster. 
But people are still worried. Last week, 50 environmental advocacy and public health groups as well as hundreds of individuals signed a letter to the Pennsylvania governor asking him to attend a public meeting to hear their health concerns. The state’s epidemiologist attended instead. 
The region has a toxic legacy that predates natural gas – including hundreds of years of coal-mining and agriculture pesticide use. But Ketyer said the cancers did not begin until fracking arrived. 
Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection found the Shell plant’s hazardous air pollutants--which cause cancer and other serious sicknesses--“will not threaten public health and safety,” spokesman Neil Shader said. 
Residents also worry about gas industry accidents. One September morning in 2018, Karen Gdula awoke to an explosion and flames shooting into the air from a 24-inch pipeline buried a few houses away. Her neighbours narrowly escaped with several of their dogs, but they lost their home, another dog and four cats in the fire. 
 
  
  
   
    
    The Guardian has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis – some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear.
    The investigation has involved more than 20 Guardian journalists working across the world for the past six months.
    The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965. The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute,&nbsp;calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: ""The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become.""
    One aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from individual responsibilities to power structures – so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change.&nbsp;
    Another aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.

A second pipeline is under construction that will cross over the one that exploded. Gdula has been working with the construction company to make it safer for the neighbourhood. “My goal is safety,” she said. “We don’t believe we can stop them but we can do what we can to be safe.” 
Global heating 
Natural gas from shale – the type that is extracted with fracking – is expected to double in the US in the coming decades, mostly in the east, according to the US Energy Information Administration. And the energy department expects an enormous 20-fold surge in ethane production in the eastern US by 2025. 
Scientists say to avoid catastrophe from rising temperatures, people must rapidly reduce their emissions from fossil fuels to net zero by 2050. 
The world is already 1C hotter than before industrialisation, and it is on track to warm an additional 2C – worsening extreme weather and poverty and leading to rapidly rising seas. 
The Center for International Environmental Law, a pro-environment group, estimates that by 2050 climate-harming emissions from the production and incineration of plastics could reach 56 gigatons per year, or 10-13% of the budget allowed for keeping temperatures from rising more than 1.5C. 
There is no way of knowing how much a plastics hub in Appalachia will exacerbate global warming and offset the work of states and cities trying to cut heat-trapping emissions. The ethane boom will, however, stretch beyond western Pennsylvania into Ohio and West Virginia. 
In nearby Barnesville, Jill Hunkler said she was driven from her home by fracking. As gas wells were constructed around her, Hunkler said she started to experience headaches, breathing problems, burning eyes and a metallic taste in her mouth. 
Hunkler counts 78 producing wells within five miles of her house, according to data from FracTracker. “There’s just no respect for the local community’s health,” she claimed. 
Bev Reed, a nursing graduate and intern at the Sierra Club, a grassroots environmental organisation, said the community had no say over whether the facility was built. 
“We already know it’s not sustainable and that Appalachia has been pillaged and plundered and raped for pretty much as long as its existed,” Reed said. “We’ve seen enough and we deserve better.”"
80,cancer,Healthcare workers 'should be screened for Covid-19 every week',"Healthcare workers should be screened for Covid-19 every week to protect patients from asymptomatic infection, the head of the Francis Crick Institute’s testing facility has said.  
The call comes amid concerns that hospitals are becoming hotspots for disease transmission and evidence that a significant fraction of those infected show few or no symptoms. 
“For all our fuss about social distancing we’re ignoring one of the main routes of infection in front of our eyes,” said Prof Charles Swanton, who is leading the testing effort at the institute in London. “It’s almost untenable to argue you shouldn’t be screening and isolating healthcare workers.” 
The institute is next week launching a pilot to screen staff at University College hospital to identify asymptomatic Covid-19 cases, but the approach has not been explicitly endorsed by the government and there have been no indications that this is being considered as a national strategy. 
The institute’s testing lab has capacity to run 3,000 tests a day, so would be capable of running a screening operation for staff at UCH, if this approach were adopted. 
 
  
  
   default
  
  
 
A possible concern is that screening could lead to large numbers of doctors and nurses, who are otherwise well, being required to self-isolate. But the alternative – leaving asymptomatic, but potentially infectious staff on the wards – runs contrary to the principle of “do no harm”, Swanton said. 
Patients were very aware of the risk, he added, and were staying at home due to justified fears that they could contract the virus by attending hospitals or seeing GPs. “They’re too scared to go to hospital and you can understand why,” Swanton said. 
The situation appears to be causing fewer emergency calls from people who have suffered strokes or heart attacks, potentially fuelling the rise in non-coronavirus deaths seen in figures released this week. Those with other conditions may also be deterred from seeking medical help. 
On Thursday the Guardian reported that London A&amp;E chiefs were concerned that patients were staying away, saying in a meeting last week: “People don’t want to go near hospital. As a result salvageable conditions are not being treated.” 
Swanton, who is also chief clinician at Cancer Research UK, said: “I’m concerned that cancer patients need to be able to have the confidence to come into wards. We’re in this for another month at least, probably two or three. That’s a very long time to have a delayed cancer diagnosis.” 
 
  
  
   
    What is Covid-19?
    
    Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.
    
    What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?
    
    According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment.
    About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.
    In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:
    
     a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back
     a new continuous cough - this means you’ve started coughing repeatedly
    
    As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.
    
    Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?
    
    Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.
    In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.
    
   
  
  
 
There is growing evidence that a significant proportion of people infected with Covid-19 show few or no symptoms and that up to half of transmission may take place before symptoms occur. 
A study of people onboard the formerly quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was docked in Yokohama, Japan, found 328 of the 634 positive cases (52%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing, and other studies have found a range of 20-80% of people carrying the virus but showing no symptoms. 
To identify such cases, healthcare workers had ideally to be screened weekly in high-risk areas, Swanton said. 
Graham Cooke, professor of infectious diseases at Imperial College London, agreed that screening should be seriously considered as the testing capacity is increased this month. 
“I do think we need to raise the conversation about large-scale testing in healthcare settings,” Cooke said. “Now we’ve got good evidence that there’s significant transmission in people who are pre-symptomatic. We’ve got concerns about transmission in hospitals and we’ve got much-improved capacity for testing. There are reasons to be cautious, but one of them is not to be afraid of what we might find.” 
 
  Callout callout-coronavirus ""> 
 
The government has not released figures on the rates of hospital-acquired Covid-19, but there are calls for this data to be collected and made public. 
“In Sars onward transmission in hospitals was a huge problem,” said Carl Heneghan, a professor and director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, at the University of Oxford. “There’s a data crisis here. We don’t know what proportion are being admitted with Covid-19 and what proportion are getting it in hospital. I suspect it could be 20%.”"
81,cancer,"We don’t mock smokers with lung cancer, so why sneer at the obese?","A report from Diabetes UK says that the number of obese people in the UK has doubled over the past 20 years, with record numbers treated for type 2 diabetes. There are now 13 million adults with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 30 (defining obesity), which is just under 30% of over-16s, with 20% of children obese by the time they leave primary school. This puts extra strain on the NHS, with care required for cancers, heart problems, knee replacements and other obesity-related conditions. All of which recalls Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, terming the obesity crisis “the new smoking” in terms of the calamitous effect on the NHS. However, obesity differs in one key societal respect: people suffering from smoking-derived illnesses aren’t routinely mocked and insulted. We know the drill with obesity by now or should do. While personal responsibility should never be discounted, there are well-documented complex social factors contributing to obesity, including poverty, inadequate health and nutritional education, while food companies flood the marketplace with cheap calorific food full of sugar, fat and salt. Once people enter the downward spiral of obesity, it can be terrifyingly difficult (confusing, exhausting, expensive) to extract themselves. As with other addictions, there are also elements of self-harm and self-medication: eating because you hate yourself; eating to feel better. It can’t help that obese people are demoralised and stigmatised by a society that feels entitled to blame, castigate and ridicule them. By contrast, it may sometimes be acknowledged that smokers “brought it on themselves”, but there’s no culture of mockery. People with lung cancer aren’t harangued; emphysema sufferers aren’t scorned. Why is there such a marked difference in attitudes? Smoking can kill you, but so can obesity. Cigarettes are highly addictive, but so is junk food. For years, tobacco companies were allowed to promote their product as cool and glamorous; food companies are “regulated” with inadequate sugar taxes and so on. In rational terms, obese people deserve a degree of public compassion that they rarely receive. When did people decide to give themselves permission to be crueller, more judgmental, towards the obese than to almost any other struggling social group? It matters, because this entrenched vitriol has evolved into the kind of everyday sizeism that people feel they can get away with. Spouting prejudice lands you in trouble, but you can still have a pop about someone’s weight under the guise of “humour” or “advice”. Maybe it’s time for a change. The new figures on obesity are shocking, but with nearly a third of the adult population classed as obese, that’s a lot of people who could decide to fight back, maybe even demand protections. Finally, fat-shaming could end up recognised for what it is, what it has always been – a hate crime by any other name. Festive crisps and flatpacks? Oh give these ads a rest     Excitable Edgar, hero of the 2019 John Lewis Christmas advert. Photograph: John Lewis &amp; Partners/PA    Who could I sue for my chronic Christmas advert fatigue? There are the usual suspects: John Lewis has gone all out with a bizarre animation about an arsonist-dragon called Excitable Edgar, blasting fire at icy village ponds and Christmas puddings. (Think of it as a nursery-level Game of Thrones, where “winter is coming” but nobody goes topless or dies.) Marks &amp; Spencer has people boogying psychotically in Christmas jumpers in scenes that threaten to evolve into an episode of Black Mirror. Then there are the supermarkets – Aldi producing a Leafy Blinders showstopper about carrots and sprouts. Elsewhere, Boots slightly hysterically bangs on about its new online Bootique concept – who knew that buying bath bombs could be so dystopian? But did Walkers Crisps (Mariah Carey sending up her diva persona) really need to do a Christmas advert? Are Christmas crisps a thing now? Similarly, there’s an advert from Ikea – because, erm, nothing screams yuletide more than easy-to-assemble flatpack furniture? Regarding a Christmas advert from Visa, what concept could possibly make sense apart from: “Ho, ho, ho – you’re overdrawn and it’s not even 2020 yet!” As for Amazon, maybe next year the online giant could spread festive cheer by paying its fair share of taxes? Some are great fun (Argos has a daddy-daughter drumming duo and a crowd-surfing teddy). But there are just too many of them, with every retail name you’ve ever heard of screeching their money-grubbing seasonal greetings in your face. If I tried to watch them all, I’d be there well into the new year, covered in snowflakes and tinsel like a disturbing festive version of Jack Nicholson frozen in the maze at the end of The Shining. Happy Christmas everybody and without meaning to be a curmudgeon, this kind of festive advert overkill could make a Grinch of us all. The ‘rough sex’ defence plea is growing. It’s a shocking trend     Natalie Connoll, whose partner, John Broadhurst, was found guilty of manslaughter by negligence. Photograph: Staffordshire Police/PA    It’s good to see that John Broadhurst has lost his appeal to have the sentence of three years and eight months he was given reduced for the manslaughter by negligence of his partner, Natalie Connolly. Connolly suffered 40 separate injuries, including serious internal trauma, and died as she lay at the bottom of stairs. This case was also notable for being part of what appears to be a growing legal trend for “rough sex” being used as part of a defence plea. Generally, it is claimed that the female victims demand consensual rough sex, dying accidentally as a result. Rough sex is supposed to be about sex, not death. Even if people are into rough sex, it doesn’t mean they have a death wish. As for the apparent epidemic of women demanding to be battered and choked, hardcore pornography has doubtless popularised rough sex, but perhaps we should remember who for. Which gender watches the most pornography? While pondering that question, let’s keep an eye on that worryingly fashionable “rough sex” legal defence argument and make sure it is not becoming a cynical, self-serving exercise that debases and exploits the voiceless victims. • Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist"
82,cancer,Cancer diagnoses crisis after shutdown at Lucas Heights nuclear facility,"Australia is facing a shortage of medicine vital for cancer diagnoses due to a mechanical fault at the Lucas Heights nuclear medicine facility. Less than three months after production was suspended at the new Australian nuclear medicine facility when two workers were exposed to an unsafe dose of radiation, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation has confirmed another shutdown occurred on Friday. While Ansto insists there are “no safety implications” from the failure, a shortfall in production of the radioisotope molybdenum-99 or Mo-99 could have severe implications. Ansto admitted Australia was experiencing “significant impacts on availability of nuclear medicine”, and doctors have told Guardian Australia that unless production resumes they will be forced to “play Pontius Pilate” with their patients’ health.   Related: Australia's high cancer survival rates attributed to earlier detection    “This will be a crisis by next week,” the director of Kalgoorlie Medical Imaging in Western Australia, Peter Tually, said. “I’m going to be presented with six or seven referrals and I’m going to have to make a decision about who I can see and who I can’t.” The $168m nuclear medicine facility at Lucas Heights, south of Sydney, was announced by the federal government in 2012 with the goal of tripling Australian production of Mo-99, the parent isotope of Technetium-99m. The isotope is used to diagnose a variety of heart, lung, organ and musculoskeletal conditions, as well as cancers. Ansto said the supply of medicine made before Friday’s incident has been distributed to hospitals and nuclear medicine clinics, and it was working to “understand the cause of the mechanical defect, and safely rectify the issue”. On Thursday, Ansto said it had secured a limited supply of MO-99 and would be able to supply it from next week. “We expect that the amounts from overseas will gradually increase over the next three weeks, starting with 10 per cent of normal supply from next week and working up to around a third of normal supply by early next month,” Ansto said. “Both investigations and work are continuing to safely progress mechanical repairs within ANSTO’s ANM facility.” Tually, who has been critical of the handling of medicine shortages, said the medical industry was “again reeling” as a result of the shutdown. “My job now is to determine which patient gets a test and which one has to miss out [and] they are not easy phone calls to make,” he said. In June last year production was halted after another mechanical fault. On previous occasions Australia has sourced the product from South Africa or the United States. The Ansto spokesman said the organisation was exploring the possibility of importing bulk medicine while repairs were undertaken. “Manufacturing will resume after the fault is safely and properly rectified,” he said. “We will keep the regulator and nuclear medicine community informed as we work to rectify this issue.” He said “further rectification works will be carried out in a safe way that minimises health risk”, after approval from the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency. Lucas Heights is only one of 11 reactors around the world that produces nuclear isotopes for medical imaging and treatment. As well as providing about 85% of the nuclear medicine products used in Australian hospitals, it produces thousand more doses of Mo-99 for international patients."
83,cancer,The Friend review – standard-issue cancer drama jerks no tears,"There’s a telling moment in the third act of The Friend, a drama of terminal illness, where Dakota Johnson’s character, nearing the end of her life, looks in the mirror and tells her husband, played by Casey Affleck, that she looks ugly. She bemoans the fact that people can no longer look at her and he provides reassurance, telling her she looks as beautiful as ever. It’s a sweet scene on paper but in the Blackfish director Gabriela Cowperthwaite’s fact-based yet sanitised film, it doesn’t ring true. Johnson, at her movie worst, is still supernaturally beautiful with clear skin and a cute pixie cut and the moment showcases one of the film’s biggest failings: an unwillingness to show just how horrifying cancer can be.   Related: Blackbird review – Sarandon and Winslet's lifeless death drama    In the award-winning Esquire article from which the film is based, death is described as “grotesque” and “undignified” and the details are uncomfortably graphic – the author should know, he’s the husband who cared for his wife as she died of stomach cancer in their home. But up on screen it’s as prettified as it would be in a Lifetime movie, Cowperthwaite avoiding the opportunity to root her film in reality, a surprise given her background as a documentarian. The story jumps back and forth through a 14-year period, telling us the story of a couple, Matt and Nicole, as they befriend Dane (Jason Segel), who becomes a mainstay in their lives. When Nicole is diagnosed with cancer, Dane finds himself helping out with the house and their two children more and more until finally he moves in, initially for a two week period before gradually realising that he can’t leave them. There’s promise here with a poignant opening scene showing the unimaginably difficult process of deciding how to tell two young children that their mother’s cancer is terminal. It feels unusually specific and given the source material, I hoped that the film that followed would be equally raw. But while the screenwriter, Brad Ingelsby, does root us in the minutiae of the trio’s day-to-day, it’s never in particularly interesting ways, and over an indulgent 135-minute runtime, we gradually grow tired of them, often questioning exactly why we need to know so much about their lives. It’s also as if both Ingelsby and Cowperthwaite are aware of the potentially generic nature of the film and so they employ a silly, unsuccessful structure which sees the film flipping between different time periods, each vignette accompanied with text that explains how far before or after Nicole’s diagnosis we are. It’s incredibly disorienting and only audience members with a pocket-sized Homeland cork board will be able to slot the timeline into place. It’s a gimmick to make us think there’s more here, like the film’s over-used drone shots, and all it does is frustrate us even further. There are narrative gaps being filled in that we don’t really care about, as if we’re watching a mystery rather than an easy-to-predict drama, and any dramatic tension over the impact of someone’s infidelity is immediately destroyed given that it all happens in a flashback. There’s an over-investment in our interest in these characters, especially since Ingelsby struggles to bring them to life. Johnson is a wonderful actor and she does have her moments here but I never really bought her as a gregarious musical theatre enthusiast and when we finally see her sing, the casting is made even harder to swallow. Segel is firmly, boringly, within his standard man-child wheelhouse, albeit with less comedy and more drama, and so it’s left up to Affleck to carry the movie. He’s easily the best thing about it and the film’s most emotive moments belong entirely to him. But for a film about such a devastating topic, a mother in her 30s dying of cancer, there’s not the stinging sadness that we expect to arrive, and it’s not through lack of trying, with Cowperthwaite virtually offering us tissues for the last 30 minutes. Try reading the article instead.  The Friend is showing at the Toronto film festival and will be released at a later date "
84,cancer,"'War on cancer' metaphors may do harm, research shows","The ubiquitous use of war metaphors when referring to cancer may do more harm than good, according to research into the psychological impact the phrases have on people’s views of the disease. Framing cancer in military terms made treatment seem more difficult and left people feeling more fatalistic about the illness, believing there was little they could do to reduce their risk, researchers found. And while the language is intended to motivate people and make them more vigilant at spotting symptoms and getting them examined, the study found no evidence this was the case. “Our work suggests battle metaphors could have a negative impact on how people think about cancer and those thoughts could undermine people’s intentions to engage in healthy behaviours,” said David Hauser, a psychologist at Queen’s University in Ontario, Canada.   Related: Having cancer is not a fight or a battle    Hauser and Norbert Schwarz, a professor of psychology at the University of Southern California, studied the impact of war metaphors in cancer care after noticing how common the language had become. For example, instead of simply having cancer, patients were invaded by enemy cells that were fought with the latest ammunition in the oncologist’s armoury, in a battle many brave heroes lost. “People use these metaphors thinking they have a beneficial impact, or at least no negative impact, but nobody has actually studied it,” Hauser told the Guardian. In four separate experiments involving nearly 1,000 generally healthy volunteers, the researchers looked at how people’s opinions varied on reading passages about cancer patients that included battle metaphors, journey metaphors, or no metaphors at all. The battle metaphors included words such as “fight”, “attack” and invaded”. Military metaphors may not be benign, the study found. After reading accounts of cancer patients sprinkled with war metaphors, people rated cancer treatment as more difficult than those who read the same passages with journey metaphors, or no metaphors at all. In an article to appear in Health Communication, the researchers warn that highlighting the difficulty of cancer treatment could generate fear that made people put symptoms out of their mind, with potentially harmful consequences. Battle metaphors also made people more fatalistic. On reading passages peppered with war phrases, people agreed more with statements such as, “If someone is meant to get cancer, they will get it no matter what they do.” This could hit health drives to reduce people’s risk of the disease. Finally, rather than encouraging people to get to a doctor faster if they had suspicious symptoms, the military phrases were found to have no beneficial effect. Hauser said war metaphors were so ingrained in cancer language that it would be difficult to do away with them. But he called on cancer charities, those in the media, and others to be more aware that the language may not be helpful. He said more research was needed to see whether the metaphors were valued by cancer patients in particular. Mandy Mahoney, a mother of two and an outreach support worker in London who has incurable metastatic breast cancer, said: “I think cancer-speak can be quite negatively loaded: the brave, fighter, warrior and survivor standard descriptors put an awful lot of pressure on the newly diagnosed.   Related: Stop ‘fighting’ cancer, and start treating it like any other illness | Simon Jenkins    “You feel like you’re letting people down if you can’t manage permanent positivity or you have an emotionally wobbly day. It’s not constructive or helpful when you’re focusing on getting through the day-to-day living of a cancer diagnosis and treatment schedule. I prefer clear, factual language, so I describe myself as “living” with incurable cancer. I’m not brave or inspirational, I’m just trying to live the life I have left well.” Margaret McCartney, a Glasgow-based GP, writer and broadcaster, said the use of military metaphors by charities was problematic. “There have been frequent uses of “war” or “fighting” when fundraising or in their literature, despite many people with cancer saying that it deeply upsets them. “People who die from cancer have not died because they didn’t try hard enough. This research should give pause for thought to organisations who continue to use war terminology. The language we choose has profound consequences.” Karen Roberts, the chief nursing officer at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: “There’s no such thing as a ‘typical’ person with cancer, so people have different preferences when it comes to discussing it. Talking about ‘battling’ cancer helps some people remain upbeat, but others find the effort of keeping up a brave face exhausting and are unable to open up as a result.” Martin Ledwick, Cancer Research UK’s head information nurse, said: “There are no right or wrong words for people talking about their own personal experience and some people do see their cancer experience as a fight or a battle. But for others, we know that ‘fighting talk’ can be unhelpful and make them feel guilty or inadequate if they feel unable to ‘fight’, or if their cancer comes back in spite of treatment. “This study adds more evidence to highlight the importance of being sensitive when we are communicating about cancer.”"
85,cancer,How to survive the fake news about cancer,"For Eileen O’Sullivan, being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013 was the catalyst for a deluge of distinctly unscientific and frequently dangerous advice. An investment manager with a analytical mind, she began seeking information to better understand her potentially life-altering condition. But from the moment Eileen starting searching online, misinformation was unavoidable: “This is when all the suggestions start rolling in,” she says. “Before diagnosis, I had never heard of crank treatments for cancer: herbs, supplements, diets, juicing, clean eating, homeopathy, essential oils, nor adverts for overseas alternative cancer clinics. I certainly didn’t go looking for them, but I got endless prompts based on keywords such as breast cancer. I was also inundated with relatives and friends coming out with crackpot therapies – and even from other patients in chemo wards and waiting rooms.” As a cancer researcher deeply involved in science outreach, I can attest that few subjects provoke quite the emotional response that cancer does. There is not a family in the world untouched by the disease, and the word itself is enough to induce a sense of fear in even the hardiest among us. Cancer is oppressive and all-pervasive: half of us alive today will experience a direct brush with it. But despite its ubiquity, it remains poorly understood and falsehoods around it can thrive.  Online, dubious claims about cancer are rife, from outright “cures” to assertions of a conspiracy to suppress “the truth” about it. In 2016, more than half of the 20 most shared cancer articles on Facebook consisted of medically discredited claims. And this goes far beyond Facebook – the Wall Street Journal recently revealed that YouTube was hosting accounts with thousands of subscribers that promoted bogus cancer treatments. O’Sullivan’s scepticism gave her some immunity to the lure of empty promises. But having lost her mother to breast cancer, “fear left me more vulnerable to pseudoscience than I would care to admit”, she says. She is now a passionate patient advocate, steering others away from damaging falsehoods – a problem she sees as unrelenting. This grim assessment chimes with the observations made by Dr Robert O’Connor of the Irish Cancer Society: “Practically all patients are exposed to misinformation, [coming] from well-meaning but misinformed loved ones to a plethora of exploitative and profiteering sources on social media”. A quick web search reveals ostensible treatments ranging from the vaguely scientific-sounding to the profoundly esoteric. The US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) non-exhaustive list of debunked claims numbers more than 187, while Wikipedia’s list of bogus cures run from “energy-based” to “spiritual healing”. Other claims involve hyperbaric oxygen therapy, cannabis oil, shark cartilage, ketogenic diets and baking soda. There is increasing concern that such fictions risk eclipsing reputable information. Macmillan Cancer Support recently appointed a nurse specifically to debunk online stories, prompting the Lancet Oncology to comment: “How has society got to this point, where unproven interventions are being chosen in preference to evidence-based, effective treatments? Unfortunately, disinformation and – frankly – lies are widely propagated and with the same magnitude as verified evidence.”    Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are dismissed by charlatans as poisons, imperilling lives    Similar concerns are echoed by Cancer Research UK as well as the Wellcome Trust. New patients in particular are often targeted by those pushing cancer “cures”, and while some of these are well meaning but misguided, others are commercially driven. Sonya Canavan, another cancer survivor, noted: “In the breast cancer patient forum I used to post on, I often saw ‘patients’ posting about all kinds of quackery, who turned out to be salespeople trawling for business.” That pseudoscience is being hawked to vulnerable patients isn’t a new problem – cancer scams have existed for decades, and combating them was the impetus behind the 1939 Cancer Act. The substantial difference now is the ease with which falsehoods can be disseminated. Cancer surgeon David Gorski, professor of surgery and oncology at the Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit, Michigan and managing editor of the online journal Science-Based Medicine, notes that cancer misinformation is “way more prevalent now for the same reason other misinformation and conspiracy theories are so prevalent – because they’re so easily spread on social media.”  Whether born out of a desire to help, or naked charlatanism, the net impact of such misinformation is overwhelmingly negative. Patients engaged with unproved treatments for cancer are more likely to reject conventional treatment, or delay life-saving interventions. This comes at a terrible cost; patients who subscribe to alternative approaches are more than twice as likely to die in the same period as those who rely on conventional therapies. Worse again, it is not uncommon for promoters of dubious information to resort to scaremongering over conventional therapy. Both radiotherapy and chemotherapy are frequently dismissed as “poisons”, imperilling lives. Cancer is frightening, and promises of simple cures can be alluring.      Stanislaw Burzynski in 1997 at the federal courthouse in Houston, Texas, where he faced 34 charges of mail fraud, which were dismissed, and 41 of violating FDA regulations, upon which the jury failed to reach a verdict. Photograph: Pat Sullivan/AP    All false claims betray the same basic misunderstanding, however: cancer is not a monolithic entity, but a family of more than 200 known diseases. Arising from mutations in a patient’s cells, cancer is extremely complex and diverse. It is highly unlikely that a single “magic bullet” could treat cancer in all its forms. The idea of a panacea is attractive, but woefully misguided, and a klaxon warning of dubious science. Unscientific interventions can nevertheless come with substantial price tags.  Based in his Texas clinic, Stanislaw Burzynski claims to cure cancer with a unique “antineoplaston” therapy. Despite operating for decades, according to the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) “other investigators have been unable to duplicate these results”. Since its inception, the clinic has been the subject of numerous FDA warnings yet continues to promote itself as capable of curing patients. And it does not come cheap – the US NCI warns patients that treatment costs upwards of $7,500-$10,000 monthly (£5,600-£7,580) and says: “The evidence for use of antineoplaston therapy as a treatment for cancer is inconclusive. Controlled clinical trials are necessary to assess the value of this therapy.” Despite negative publicity, it’s business as usual for Burzynski. If anything, crowdfunding may have made his clinic more popular. In lieu of scientific evidence, it relies on gushing testimonials to lure new customers, though in some cases, these come from patients already deceased – a fact absent from the promotional material. This is contemptible, but in no way unique – there is an abundance of dubious clinics worldwide promising the impossible at eye-watering prices. Last year an investigation on Irish television probed clinics in Istanbul that were claiming huge successes with unconventional therapies. Patients were charged more than €130,000 (£116,000) and given the all-clear in Turkey. According to the programme, patients discovered their cancers had progressed markedly when scanned after returning home. Germany, too, is home to several effectively unregulated clinics, presented as luxury spas but promising cures. These are backed by fawning testimonials pitched at international customers, with treatments costing hundreds of thousands of euros – despite no evidence for their efficacy.  Such exploitation goes far beyond the immediate victims, with crowdfunding typically used to meet their exorbitant prices. A paper in the British Medical Journal last year, based on figures collected by the Good Thinking Society, found that at least £8m had been raised since 2012 in the UK alone for unsubstantiated or discredited cancer treatments. As Good Thinking Society project director Michael Marshall explains: “Sums raised through crowdfunding are just the tip of the iceberg, with many patients taking out loans, mortgaging their houses, and spending their life savings. When these supposed cures turn out to offer no benefit, families have been left coping with huge debts when they are grieving for their loved one.” To explain the paucity of evidence for their claims, purveyors of quack remedies accuse the medical and scientific community of suppressing cures for cancer. This is not a mere fringe belief – 37% of Americans believe the FDA is doing just that. But the claim is nonsense. It would require a vast conspiracy of hundreds of thousands of scientists and doctors to sustain – a scenario unlikely to endure. Plus, if there were such a conspiracy, wouldn’t those who work in the cancer sphere be just as susceptible to its malignant influence as anyone? We all lose loved ones to cancer, and succumb to it. Conspiracy claims foster distrust between patients and healthcare teams.   Related: My patient swapped chemotherapy for essential oils. Arguing is a fool’s errand | Ranjana Srivastava    The rise in cancer misinformation is part of a wider problem with online falsehoods. Like the equally dangerous explosion in anti-vaccine myths, cancer untruths have an impact on both our physical wellbeing and on the public understanding of science and medicine. In a sea of sound and fury, discerning between the reputable and the repugnant isn’t always easy, but there are excellent resources available for patients and their families. Well-researched guides by Cancer Research UK and the US National Cancer Institute are enlightening and authoritative.  Like anti-vaccine sentiment, cancer myths thrive on social media. There is a strong argument that these platforms have a moral obligation to remove groups and individuals propagating misinformation. As O’Sullivan notes, “Facebook, YouTube and Twitter lead a patient down a rabbit hole, with many thinking this is ‘doing their research’. I don’t think we can stop those making false cancer claims, but maybe we can insulate patients and regulate those making cancer claims as well as holding social media platforms accountable.” In the wake of a measles resurgence driven in part by online anti-vaccine activism, several social media platforms have promised to massage their algorithms to reduce “fake news” on cancer. But this filtering is easily bypassed. Social media business models thrive on engagement rather than veracity, and a cynic might think they have little reason to regulate such content, beyond appearing to be concerned. Whether the problem is absence of ability or inclination, health misinformation remains widespread. It’s imperative we improve our ability to assess the avalanche of medical claims: our continued wellbeing depends on it. Dr David Robert Grimes is a cancer researcher, physicist and science writer.

86,cancer,Megadeth's Dave Mustaine diagnosed with throat cancer,"Megadeth’s Dave Mustaine is undergoing treatment for throat cancer, he has told fans. The 57-year-old frontman said that his doctors had “mapped out a treatment plan they feel has a 90% success rate”, which he has already started. The diagnosis has led the US metal group to cancel the majority of their forthcoming tour, with the exception of their cruise in October, in which the band will participate “in some form”. Mustaine added that the group will continue working on the follow-up to their Grammy-winning 2016 album Dystopia and will return to touring as soon as possible. A number of Mustaine’s peers wished him well. “Please join me in sending all of our most powerful positive mind bullets to my brother Dave,” said Scott Ian of Anthrax. As the original lead guitarist in Metallica, Mustaine was expelled from the group during recording sessions in New York by Lars Ulrich and James Hetfield as a result of his alcohol and drug use. His bandmates put him on a coach to Los Angeles, where he formed a short-lived band named Fallen Angels that evolved into Megadeth. The thrash metal group released one album for Combat before signing to Capitol records and releasing their second album, Peace Sells … But Who’s Buying, in 1986. Pitchfork described it as “a dead serious record that never takes itself too seriously, a slab of political shock commentary loaded with black comedy”.   Related: 'It had to be raw and dangerous' – Def Leppard, Saxon and Venom on 80s British metal    The band’s success continued in spite of Mustaine’s drug problems, which saw him enter rehab at the turn of the 90s. Mustaine, who has voiced support for both the Democrats and Republicans in the past, stated in 2012 that he believed Barack Obama was not born in the US despite the publication of Obama’s birth certificate. Mustaine and bassist Dave Ellefson are the two remaining founder members of Megadeth, following the departure of drummer Shawn Drover and guitarist Chris Broderick in 2014. The band’s former drummer, Nick Menza, died after collapsing on stage in May 2016."
87,cancer,"I was juggling work, kids and cancer and needed help. Then 20 new friends swooped to my rescue","Some years ago, my husband and I visited old friends who were preparing to move house. When we were leaving, we told them to let us know if they needed any help. A few weeks later, we were surprised when they called us and asked if we could help on the day of the move. We didn’t mind, but just had not expected our vague offer of help to be taken up. “Shout if you need anything,” is just something you say, isn’t it? A few years later, in 2016, I went from being a pregnant mother of a toddler to a cancer patient overnight. I did things that seem, looking back, unthinkable, such as undergoing surgery while pregnant and starting chemotherapy when my daughter was one week old and still in intensive care in a hospital 60 miles from home. My husband, son and I had moved from London to Leicestershire a few months before, and we didn’t know many people in our new village. Friends from afar, all with young families of their own, sent flowers, chocolates and books, all of which helped. But what we lacked was on-the-ground support. Perhaps oddly, it wasn’t surgery or chemo that broke me in the end. It was about 18 months later, when my husband was in hospital because of his Crohn’s disease. I was looking after our two young children on my own, and my daughter fell down the stairs from top to bottom. She was unharmed, but I started crying and couldn’t stop. It became clear to me, in that moment, that I needed help. Why is asking for help so hard? Are we afraid of showing weakness, preferring to keep up our social media image of picture-perfect lives? Or is it that we don’t feel we deserve it, that everyone else is busy and overwhelmed too, and why should they put all of that to one side to give us a hand? The way we live now, so many of us settled far from our extended family, with both parents working as we try to juggle an array of childcare, hoping against hope that our children don’t get ill on the day of our big deadline/meeting/presentation, leaves so much space for help. And yet we chat at the school gate or nursery pickup, never asking for or offering it. I had been documenting my breast cancer experience in a blog and had built up a following of local friends and associates. So on the day of my daughter’s fall, I wrote a post asking for help. The responses flooded in immediately. People want to help, I realised. They’re just not always sure how, or what to offer. If you reach out, they reach back. Within a couple of days, I had a new WhatsApp group with about 20 people to call on in tough times. And that I did. Once, when I was stuck at a hospital and thought I might need someone to pick up my daughter from nursery. Another time just to ask advice about a minor injury. Or when I needed a lift to an appointment. It is usually enough to know it is there, quite honestly. Two months ago, I had my biggest operation yet: breast reconstruction using tissue from my tummy. I was under anaesthetic for 11 hours and told to expect to be out of action for up to 12 weeks. A little more practised now, I asked my network for help. They came forward offering playdates, pickups and meals. One friend who doesn’t have children said she didn’t feel able to offer childcare but really wanted to cook us some meals. I thanked her, thinking she might drop round a cottage pie at some point. But when I didn’t organise anything, she pressed me on it. For the first six weeks post-surgery, a home-cooked meal was delivered almost every night, and it meant that my husband, who was trying to manage work and the kids, had one less thing to think about. I still don’t find it easy to say I am struggling. But I am now an advocate for getting over yourself and asking for help. We live busy, difficult, complicated lives. I have friends who work late into the night because that’s the only way to make it all fit. I have friends who are single parents, with all the weight of that responsibility resting solely with them. I have friends who coparent after a split, who manage their own hurt and anger to do what is best for the children. None of it is easy. Now I look for ways to help others. I know the difficulty of asking, so I try to see that need and offer, when I can. I hope that one of the things cancer has given me is the ability to be a better friend. Because, trite as it sounds, sometimes a tiny bit of help really does go a long way. And sometimes we are bending over backwards to make something work when a friend could have stepped in and lightened the load without it really having much impact on their own day.

89,cancer,"Cancer, obesity and Boris Johnson’s ‘sin tax’ error","With Cancer Research UK confirming that obesity is the leading cause of four common cancers in the UK, it’s a scandal that Boris Johnson is questioning the effectiveness of taxes on food and drinks products, and whether taxes unfairly hit those on low incomes (Obesity rivals smoking as cause of several cancers, warns charity, 3 July). Rather than being penalised, the poorest stand to benefit the most. Sugary drink consumption levels tend to be highest among the most disadvantaged children, who are hit hardest by obesity and tooth decay. By suggesting exercise can help solve the UK’s obesity crisis, which is not backed by evidence unlike the sugar levy and the voluntary sugar and salt reduction programmes, Mr Johnson is unfairly putting the onus on individuals. The tax on soft drinks, commonly referred to as the “sugar tax”, has already resulted in over 50% of manufacturers reducing the sugar content of drinks since it was announced in March 2016 – the equivalent of 45m kg of sugar every year. In Mexico, a one peso per litre sugary drinks tax (a 10% price increase) led to a 12% drop in consumption overall, and a 17% drop in consumption among lower-income households. In Hungary, a tax on sugary products led 40% of manufacturers to reduce or eliminate sugar to avoid the tax. High levels of sugar consumption are contributing to soaring rates of obesity, which is a major risk factor for many serious health conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer – not to mention the huge cost to the NHS. Tackling the root causes of obesity, through a sugar tax, has the potential to bring about massive savings and we should be looking to extend levies to other high sugar, salt and fat products, not halting them.Prof Graham MacGregorChair, Action on Sugar/Action on Salt • When I saw that Boris Johnson has pledged to review “sin taxes” and declare war on “the nanny state”, I recalled Stuart Maconie’s observation in The Long Road from Jarrow: “In my experience … the people who sneer at the nanny state are usually people who had nannies.”John BoalerCalne, Wiltshire • Your story (Massive burden of alcohol on NHS hospitals revealed, 4 July) says that the treatment of people whose heavy drinking lands them in hospital runs to £3.5bn a year.

91,cancer,Wednesday briefing: Obesity rivals smoking as cancer cause,"Top story: ‘A national health crisis’ Obesity rivals smoking as a cause of cancer, responsible for more cases of bowel, kidney, ovarian and liver cancer than cigarettes, according to Cancer Research UK, Britain’s leading cancer charity. While smoking is still the biggest cause of cancer, the charity has warned the government to take action, as obese people outnumber smokers by two to one. “As smoking rates fall and obesity rates rise, we can clearly see the impact on a national health crisis when the government puts policies in place – and when it puts its head in the sand,” said Michelle Mitchell, the charity’s chief executive. She said Britain needs “urgent government intervention to end the epidemic” and save lives. Excess weight causes about 1,900 more cases of bowel cancer than smoking in the UK each year. There are also 1,400 more cases of kidney cancer caused by excess weight than by smoking each year, 460 more ovarian cancers and 180 more cases of liver cancer. The warnings come as figures were released showing that the overall smoking rate has declined to 14.7%, down from 19% in 2011. Across the UK, 26% of adults were classified as obese in 2016, while 40% of men and 30% of women were overweight. * * * Grace Millane murder – Google has been accused of “flipping the bird” at New Zealand laws by refusing to change company policy after it broke suppression orders related to the murder of British backpacker Grace Millane last year.

92,cancer,Matthew Glaetzer: ‘I'm treating this like a little injury. Cancer won’t hold me back’,"“It definitely rocks you.” Australian track cycling star Matthew Glaetzer is reflecting on a “whirlwind” month that has seen his preparations for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics derailed by a cancer diagnosis. “When you hear the ‘C’ word – you always think it won’t happen to you, but suddenly you have to deal with it yourself,” he tells Guardian Australia. Glaetzer is Australia’s best male track sprinter at the moment, with two world championship titles and three Commonwealth Games gold medals to his name. But Olympic success has eluded him. Once at London 2012 and twice at Rio 2016, Glaetzer finished fourth – a bronze medal agonisingly out of reach. “I was feeling confident I could get the job done in Tokyo,” he says. “I believed I could finally clinch a medal at the Olympics.”   Related: Shane Sutton ‘constantly’ on Richard Freeman’s case, tribunal hears    But in October, the 27-year-old felt a twinge following a gym session. “I thought I had hurt my neck.” When two weeks of physio led to minimal improvement, Glaetzer underwent an MRI. Doctors expected to find a bulged disc. Instead, they discovered nodules on his thyroid gland. An ultrasound and biopsy followed before the Adelaide-based cyclist dashed to Melbourne to test equipment for Tokyo 2020 in a wind tunnel, determined not to let his mysterious medical malady disrupt his Olympic plans. In a taxi on his way home from the wind tunnel, Glaetzer’s phone rang. “It was heavy to get that call,” he says. On the other end of the line was a doctor, delivering a diagnosis of thyroid cancer. “Thankfully we caught it early,” Glaetzer adds. Surgery soon followed, and the South Australian rider is currently convalescing. His recovery period will be short; Glaetzer will soon be back in training at the Cycling Australia’s high performance centre, with his eyes on back-to-back UCI Track World Cups in New Zealand and Brisbane in December. “I am not sure what state I will be in,” he says. “I am going to do the best I can. To be honest I need to race, just to qualify for the Olympics. I need points.” Following these competitive outings, Glaetzer will have another round of treatment before, qualification permitting, he begins preparations for Tokyo. “I do not want this stopping me from doing what I love,” he says. “This has been a setback, but as athletes we are always working with an injury here or there. I am just treating this like a little injury. If all goes well, it won’t hold me back.”     ‘This has helped me see the bigger picture,’ Glaetzer says. ‘It really puts everything into perspective.’ Photograph: Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images    Glaetzer has dreamed of Olympic glory since he first burst onto the international track cycling scene as a teenager. After winning world championship rainbows aged just 19, the tall and muscular sprinter became a poster boy for Cycling Australia. But if Glaetzer is to win his first Olympic medal on the third attempt, and ensure his place in the pantheon of Australian track greats, he will need overcome this medical scare. “It is frustrating that the journey will be even tougher now,” he says. “I have won pretty much everything other than an Olympic medal. I know how hard it is to perform when the Olympics come around, and how good the rest of the world is on that day. I have dedicated my life to this, so a medal would be huge. But the first step is to just to get there.” On that road to Tokyo, Glaetzer – a devout Christian – is taking strength from his faith. “As soon as I got that call I started praying. I thought: ‘God, it is out of my hands, I put my faith in you, and I will draw on you for strength during this period.’ I am blessed to have that source of support.”   Related: Matthew Glaetzer keeps focus on Tokyo Olympics despite cancer surgery    His faith proved particularly important following the diagnosis, because Glaetzer initially opted to keep the news quiet. “It was a massive elephant in the room,” he says. “But I did not want my Grandma to find out from anyone else, before I had the surgery.” He has now gone public in the hope it will encourage others to take medical concerns seriously. “So many guys have the ‘yeah that’ll be right, it’ll get better’ mentality,” he said recently in a statement. “But you don’t know what it could be, or how it could impact you and your family in the future. If there’s anything unusual, just go and find out what’s going on.” Whether or not Glaetzer qualifies for the Olympics, his outlook has changed. “This has helped me see the bigger picture,” he says. “It really puts everything into perspective.” If he can rapidly return to form and stand atop the Tokyo velodrome medal dais in July, it will mean a great deal to Glaetzer and his supporters. But after this scare, he knows there is something even more important than Olympic gold. “I just want to live life and have a positive impact on those around me,” he says."
93,cancer,Why is this top Democrat absent from the fight against toxic pollution in Cancer Alley?,"On a crisp autumn day in Washington last month, Mary Hampton and Robert Taylor entered Cedric Richmond’s office hoping their federal representative would take the time to listen. The two had travelled 1,000 miles from Reserve, a town in southern Louisiana where, according to US government science, the risk of cancer is the highest in the country due to airborne toxins emitted by a nearby chemical plant. Hampton and Taylor have lost numerous relatives to the disease over decades, and blame the plant’s emissions of a compound named chloroprene, listed by the US government as a likely carcinogen.   Box   Richmond, the 46-year-old congressman, has represented the residents of Reserve, and most of the people living in a densely polluted area between New Orleans and Baton Rouge referred to as Cancer Alley, for almost a decade. A rising star in the Democratic party, who now co-chairs former vice-president Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign, Richmond is the lone Democrat in Louisiana’s delegation to Washington. He has won successive elections here campaigning on healthcare expansion, voting rights and criminal justice reform. A charismatic and chisel-jawed politician, he has seen his congressional seat in Washington turn into a Democratic stronghold in the deeply Republican south. Hampton and Taylor say they were told that Richmond would sit down with them and hear about the years-long fight for clean air in their hometown. But they only got two minutes. “Looking at his face, it didn’t really seem like he was interested,” Hampton recalled. “It was like he was trying to brush us off.” During their short interaction, according to Hampton, Taylor and one other present for the meeting, Richmond acknowledged community concerns over emissions from the plant, operated by the Japanese chemicals company Denka, and described them as a worry. Richmond then shifted the conversation away from his own advocacy and urged the residents to vote to remove Donald Trump from office. The plant has been operating in Reserve, belching out chloroprene emissions sometimes hundreds of times above the EPA’s suggested exposure limit, since 1968, spanning four Democratic presidencies and six Republican. Reserve, a majority African American working-class neighbourhood, is the centre of a year-long Guardian series, Cancer Town, examining local residents’ fight for environmental justice in an area where the risk of cancer is 50 times the national average, according to the EPA.     Robert Taylor, Mary Hampton and Cedric Richmond in Washington DC. Photograph: Courtesy University Network for Human Rights    After posing for a quick photograph, where he smiled and placed his hand on Mary Hampton’s left shoulder, Richmond began to exit. As he was leaving, the congressman was asked: “How about writing them [Denka] a letter?” “There have been letters,” he said, according to one of those in the room. And then he left, leaving Hampton and Taylor to hold a 20-minute meeting with an aide from his office. A spokesman for Denka said the company had received no correspondence from the congressman. A spokeswoman for the EPA said the agency had also received no correspondence from Richmond’s office on the issue. The congressman, who declined interview requests, also declined to provide evidence of correspondence related to the plant. He also declined to answer a list of detailed questions despite multiple requested deadline extensions. Shortly after receiving the Guardian’s questions, Richmond’s communications director, Jalina Porter, blocked both authors of this article on social media. “We reached out to him [Richmond] when we first started this fight three years ago,” said Taylor, who has lost his mother, sister and nephews to cancer, while his wife is currently fighting the disease, and his daughter battling a rare intestinal disease linked to chloroprene. “One of his guys came to our first meeting but he never offered any help. Since then it’s been zero.” *** Richmond’s stature in the Democratic party has grown during his 10 years in Congress, as he has pushed on traditional civil rights issues, coastal erosion in Louisiana and fought for funding following natural and industrial disasters in the state. But the congressman, one of the highest recipients of donations from the oil, gas and chemicals industries in the Democratic House caucus, has paid little public attention to perhaps the most internationally pressing issue in Louisiana’s second congressional district – the continuing proliferation of polluting petrochemical and fossil fuel plants in the region. Seven of the 10 most air-polluted census tracts in America sit in his district, according to EPA data. While a proposed massive expansion of a plastics factory in his district could almost double the amount of toxic air pollution in the parish it will be constructed in. Analysis of Richmond’s news releases shows he has not mentioned air pollution in his district at any point during his tenure. An examination of congressional records, suggests he has not spoken about the issue in Congress. His record stands in contrast to the growing call among Democrats in Washington to address environmental justice issues in Richmond’s district. The US senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker has introduced sweeping legislation, with reference to communities in “Cancer Alley”, that would bolster federal regulation of clean air and water, and clarifies the legal rights of communities in polluted areas. Senator Elizabeth Warren has also placed Reserve at the centre of an ambitious environmental justice pledge in her run for the White House. Richmond declined to answer whether he supported the Senate bill. “I’ve been working in his district every year that he’s been a congressman, and I’ve never seen his face or any of his staff members in the communities working on these [industrial pollution] issues. It’s simply not on their radar.” said Anne Rolfes, executive director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, a not-for-profit environmental justice organization.     Richmond with Biden in Columbia, South Carolina, in June. Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images    Rolfes said Richmond could lobby for stricter regulation and enforcement and push federal agencies to conduct more environmental reviews on new polluting projects, but instead “he’s missing in action.” There have been signs of tentative progress in Reserve in the past six months. The Louisiana state environment agency, LDEQ, has moved towards legal action against Denka, the Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, has commissioned a health study in the area. But these have happened at the local level, seemingly without intervention or comment from Richmond. Still, the financial weight of major polluters in Louisiana politics is substantial. During almost a decade in Congress Richmond has taken over $400,000 in campaign donations from the oil and gas industry and chemical manufacturers, according to an analysis conducted by the non-partisan Centre for Responsive Politics at the request of the Guardian. In total, Richmond has received $279,050 in oil and gas money, placing him fifth among current House Democrats in career donations, despite 81 members having served longer tenures than him. He has taken $128,750 from chemical manufacturers, placing him sixth in career donations among current House Democrats. According to FEC filings reviewed by the Guardian, Richmond has also taken two donations, one in February 2015 for $1,500 the other for $1,000 in May 2017, from the affiliated Pac of a legal firm representing Denka’s lobbying efforts at the EPA. (Denka is appealing against the EPA’s independently peer-reviewed classification of chloroprene as a likely carcinogen.) The firm, Bracewell LLP, began lobbying for Denka in March 2017. Richmond declined to comment on his campaign funding. The congressman receives moderate marks from one environment group that scores lawmakers – he has a 74% lifetime score from the League of Conservation Voters. But his ranking plunged during the campaign season in 2018 – to 46% – when he missed votes on 15 environment-related bills, nearly half of the 35 votes tracked. Richmond declined to comment on why he missed those votes. Richmond often sides with Democrats on environment issues, with some exceptions involving the oil and gas industry – which is politically critical in Louisiana. He backed legislation that experts said would undermine environment reviews for liquefied natural gas infrastructure. He was among roughly two dozen Democrats to side with Republicans and vote for the Keystone XL pipeline in 2015. In 2019, he voted to allow oil drillers to explore the Atlantic coast – including by using seismic airgun blasting. But he voted to block them from drilling on the outer continental shelf of Florida.     Mary Hampton and Robert Taylor in DC. Photograph: Matt Roth/Earthjustice    Nonetheless, Democratic analysts in the region argue Richmond has maintained a strong grassroots base in his district through championing issues in Congress including police violence, investment in housing, infrastructure and education. Silas Lee, a Democratic pollster in Louisiana also working with the Biden campaign, argued that the fact that Richmond has been re-elected over five cycles is “indicative of delivering for his constituents and responding to the needs of the congressional district”. Lee said the high levels of donations from fossil fuel and chemicals companies are simply a reflection of the industry’s importance to the state’s economy. “It’s just the nature of politics and where you represent,” Lee said. “He can receive contributions but the bottom line is you have to be accountable to your constituents.” Although Richmond’s district, now 62% African American, has traditionally been associated with centrist Democrats, redistricting in 2014 has made it a Democratic stronghold. Richmond has not faced a Republican challenger since 2012, and in his most recent election last year was not even challenged by a Democrat. The congressman has partly kept hold of power due to his ability to vastly outspend his rivals, thanks in large part to corporate donations. But he has also kept the state’s Democratic establishment firmly onside.   Related: 'We’re just waiting to die': the black residents living on top of a toxic landfill site    In addition to declining to comment for this story, Richmond’s office refused to share a complete staff list disclosing who works for him in Washington and Louisiana, as well as on his re-election campaign. One Richmond staffer, who is not listed on the congressman’s website, was convicted of wire fraud before joining the team. In 2015, according to records on social media, Richmond hired James M “Tres” Bernhard III, son of Jim Bernhard, the founder of Louisiana’s influential Shaw Group and the former chair of the Louisiana Democratic party, who has reportedly considered a bid for governor. Tres Bernhard, who is a senior aide who directs “special projects” from Baton Rouge, was in 2013 sentenced to 27 months in federal prison for committing wire fraud and diverting nearly $500,000 from his former law firm to himself. He had previously settled a civil lawsuit that alleged he sold invalid movie tax credits and used the proceeds for his personal gain. He was permanently disbarred as a lawyer. Richmond’s office confirmed Bernhard’s employment and declined to comment on his background. Both Mary Hampton and Robert Taylor described their recent interaction with Richmond as another moment they have felt let down by their elected officials. Both have voted for the congressman in successive elections. Hampton, who has lost her brother, sister-in-law and daughter-in-law to cancer that she blames on the plant, said: “Nobody from our local government has made an attempt to help us or show us the way. “When you get up higher up [in politics], there’s very few people that are interested in our story and our plight. What we are fighting for is real. We’re not making it up. We are fighting for our lives. We are fighting for our children’s lives.”"
94,cancer,Charity highlights 'worrying' failure to improve cancer survival in England,"Survival rates for many cancers, including three of the most common – breast, colon and prostate cancers – have plateaued over the past decade, official figures for England show. The proportion of adults who survived for one year or five years respectively after being diagnosed with cancer in the four-year period 2013-2017 showed little change from levels in 2008-2012. For bladder cancer, the five-year survival rate apparently deteriorated. Dr Fran Woodard, the executive director of policy at Macmillan Cancer Support, which analysed the data, published by the Office for National Statistics on Monday, said: “After some encouraging improvement in previous years, this stall is really worrying – and is compounded by the fact that the UK is already lagging behind the rates of many other European countries. “These statistics highlight the importance of early diagnosis in cancer, as survival rates for patients diagnosed with more advanced cancers are significantly worse than those caught at an earlier stage. Whilst hardworking NHS staff do everything in their power to ensure patients are referred, diagnosed and treated as quickly as possible, they are desperately struggling to meet rising patient need.” Around 45,800 women and 320 men were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017, while 41,200 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer and around 12,000 men and 11,200 women with colon cancer. For these three cancers, variations over time were insignificant in both one-year and five-year survival rates. But for bladder cancer, the five-year survival rate dropped from 57.1% in the period 2008-2012 to 52.6% in 2013-17. Around 6,300 men and 2,400 women were diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2017. Survival rates in some cancers, including breast cancer, have doubled since the 1970s but continue to lag behind other countries. Macmillan has previously said the chances of surviving some of the most commonly occurring types of the disease in the UK trail at least 10 years behind many comparable European countries. The NHS long-term plan targets an increase in the proportion of cancers diagnosed at stages 1 and 2 from around 50% now to 75% of cancer patients by 2028 to help boost survival rates. From 2028, the aim is for 55,000 more people each year to survive cancer for at least five years after diagnosis. Emlyn Samuel, the head of policy development at Cancer Research UK, said: “We need to see changes at a much faster rate if we’re going to catch up with other countries. “Early diagnosis is key to giving patients the best chance of survival – but the NHS is struggling to meet rising demand due to chronic staff shortages in key areas. The government must invest in more staff to diagnose and treat cancer, or the ambition to diagnose 75% of cancers at an early stage by 2028 won’t be met.”   Survival estimates for children diagnosed with cancer   There was better news with respect to children, with one-, five- and 10-year childhood cancer survival rates all continuing to increase. The five-year survival rate saw the greatest improvement over time, an increase of 8.4 percentage points from 77.1% in 2001 to 85.5% predicted for children diagnosed in 2018. Prof Stephen Powis, the NHS medical director, said: “The cancer survival rate for adults in England is at an all-time high, while children’s survival is also on the rise, thanks to greater awareness, better access to tests and more lifesaving NHS treatments, all of which we will ramp up through the NHS long-term plan, with plans to offer every child with cancer a genetic test and world-leading treatments like proton beam therapy for rare tumours now available.”"
95,cancer,"War on words: cancer is a disease, not a battle","It is heartening to see a front-page article on the burden that the use of cancer war metaphors may place on patients (Cancer war metaphors may harm recovery, 10 August), but we should also note that such metaphors continue to place a burden on doctors and nurses, framing contemporary healthcare – dominated by medicine – as heroic, rather than pacific. Further, it is simply wrong for the researchers that you quote to say of the relationship between martial metaphors and their impact on patients that “nobody has actually studied it”. Particularly since Sam Vaisrub’s 1977 book Medicine’s Metaphors and Susan Sontag’s 1978 polemic Illness as Metaphor, studies have isolated differing effects of a wide-ranging typology of violence metaphors on patients by age, sex and demographics. Professor Elena Semino and colleagues at the University of Lancaster have been at the forefront of such research in the UK for many years. Global research in the field is summarised in my 2017 book Thinking With Metaphors in Medicine. To understand why war metaphors have such traction in medicine, we have to take a historical view. In 1627 the poet John Donne described how he thought he was dying from a fever that “blows up the heart”, that is a “cannon shot”. In the mid-17th century, the most famous physician in England, Thomas Sydenham, said that “disease has to be fought against, and the battle is not a battle for the sluggard”. Two centuries later, Louis Pasteur described illness as invading armies laying siege to the body that becomes a battlefield. The phrase “war against cancer” was first used in the British Medical Journal in 1904. In 1971, Richard Nixon famously declared a “war on cancer”. No wonder that today’s patients are so readily stigmatised in the wake of centuries of martial insults. Isn’t a “hospital” supposed to be a place for “hospitality”?Alan BleakleyEmeritus professor of medical education and medical humanities, Plymouth University • Cancers are as variable as the people who develop them, so I heartily endorse comments made by Martin Ledwick, Cancer Research UK’s head information nurse, about everybody needing to find their own way of talking about it. Battling metaphors hold an implicit suggestion that patients who succumb quickly have in some way failed to fight hard enough or have somehow “given in”, and that patients like myself who survive beyond their expected prognosis are in some way “tougher”. Your report on recent research indicates that people can be put off seeking early treatment if the type of metaphors being used make it all sound too difficult and daunting. This is very worrying as all the research shows that the earlier symptoms are detected, the better the chance of successful treatments and quality of life post-diagnosis. There have been major advances in cancer treatments over the last few years. Instead of using off-putting language that deters people from getting symptoms investigated, we should broadcast news of steady progress in quicker identification and consequent longer life expectancy. So no “cure” as yet, but better options for living with cancer for as long as medically sustainable.Jacinta ElliottYork • The ONS mortality report shows that dementia continues to be the leading single cause of death (Dementia is ‘biggest killer in England and Wales’, 7 August). But, if all cancers were grouped together then the disease would top the table.  Unfortunately, despite cancer accounting for over 145,000 deaths in 2018 (27% of the total), we know that thousands with the disease do not spend their final days as they would wish. Some are in hospital when they would rather be at home; others face insufficient pain relief, or are unaware of the choices available to them at the end of their lives. This autumn, as NHS bodies draw up their plans for the next five years, it is critical that they set out how people at the end of life can get the truly personalised care they need. Our hard-working NHS professionals do everything in their power to provide care and comfort at this crucial time, but there simply aren’t the numbers of staff with the right skills to have the important and compassionate conversations needed. It is vital that staff are provided with support and training so that they can prompt open discussions as early as possible and ensure people’s wishes are taken into account. The only certainty in life is death, and we need to make sure that everyone has choice and dignity when it comes.Adrienne BetteleyEnd-of-life care specialist adviser, Macmillan Cancer Support • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

96,cancer,Six-year-old’s death leads to hope of new drug for childhood cancer,"Researchers say they are close to testing a drug that could tackle a previously untreatable childhood brain cancer. The condition is known as DIPG – diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma – and every year it affects between 30 to 40 boys and girls, aged between five and 10. All develop tumours caused by the condition and die, often within months of their diagnoses. But now scientists believe they may soon be able to tackle the condition – and one of the key organisations involved is a remarkable charity set up by Amanda and Ray Mifsud, whose daughter Abbie died of DIPG in 2011. Their charity, Abbie’s Army, has raised money that has provided vital backing for research by Professor Chris Jones, of the Institute of Cancer Research, London. His work has revealed the role of a mutant gene that is involved in driving the progression of DIPG tumours and this work has, in turn, led to the development of a number of drugs that might soon be tested to see if they inhibit their progress. “We have reached a very promising stage in our preclinical work and that could see the first full clinical trials of a drug for DIPG in a couple of years,” Jones told the Observer. “When that happens, we will have produced the first new treatment developed specifically for a childhood cancer. Crucially, the help of Abbie’s Army and other children’s cancer charities has been a major boost in that effort.”     Abbie with parents Ray and Amanda Mifsud. Photograph: Handout    Early symptoms of DIPG include problems with vision, hearing and balance. These worsen as the underlying tumour grows and spreads until a patient becomes bedridden. The tumour’s location, deep in the brain stem, makes surgery impossible. In addition, the relative rarity of DIPG cases has meant it has not been a focus of interest for major pharmaceutical companies. The only standard treatment currently in use is palliative radiotherapy – which was given to Abbie. “Over the course of two months she endured and battled through her treatment,” recalled her mother. Abbie died in the morning on 13 September 2011. She was six years old. “Abbie was our whole world,” said Amanda. “And no parent ever wants to hear that there is no cure and no hope and they should never have to.” As a result of their experience the Mifsuds set up their charity, and this has since raised funds for research on DIPG that have played an important role in helping Jones direct his work on the disease. Two years ago, he discovered that tumours caused by the disease carried mutations of the gene ACVR1, which had never been found in any other kind of cancer before then. The mutation means the gene is susceptible to being switched on and to direct the manufacture of proteins when it is supposed to be switched off. This knowledge suggests ACVR1 is involved in a cascade of biochemical events that eventually produce DIPG tumours and has provided Jones and his colleagues with a specific target for tackling the condition. It is a first for scientists working on DIPG. Working with the pharmaceutical group M4K Pharma, based in Toronto, they have developed a novel class of drugs which could act as treatments for the condition. “We have identified five lead candidate drugs for further preclinical studies and expect to begin clinical trials within two years,” said Owen Roberts, chief executive of M4K Pharma. Just how quickly these trials will lead to the launching of the first effective, life-prolonging medicine for treating children afflicted by DIPG remains to be seen. “You have to go through careful protocols when carrying out drug clinical trials and these cannot be rushed,” said Jones. “On the other hand, this disease is terribly rapid in its clinical course. The average survival time is nine months. That means that when we get a drug that is in any way effective we will see very quickly that it is making improvements to a child’s life.”"
97,cancer,Chemotherapy during a pandemic is exhausting. And yet I can't stay asleep,"When someone near me coughs, my whole body tenses. The mouth sores that come with chemotherapy can irritate your throat, and the cough probably has nothing to do with coronavirus. But sometimes I can’t help but hold my breath, suddenly terrified that the virus I’ve been trying to protect myself from is mere feet from me. I’m sitting in a chair in Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue, Washington, with chemotherapy drugs pumping through my bloodstream to treat my stage 2 cervical cancer. It’s my third week of treatment and it feels more crowded than usual: I can see at least 10 other patients today, plus a few visitors and a handful of nurses. I’m trying to convince myself to use the bathroom but I’ve already been four times, and each time I have to wade through this terrifying maze of people. The hospital now requires patients and visitors to wear masks. But rather than making me feel protected, the mask traps my breath, fogs up my glasses and makes me hot and claustrophobic. I’ve been listening to my apocalypse playlist today. I made it a while back to store my favorite songs. There’s some Tragically Hip, The Cure, Awolnation and of course Hamilton. It feels appropriate, but it’s not doing much to curb my anxiety.   Related: 'What a terrible time to have cancer': falling ill during the coronavirus crisis    I just hit the halfway point in my treatment, and I’ve settled into a routine. After I got past the initial fear of chemo, the process was starting to feel fairly relaxing. I was able to get out of the house and have a few hours to myself. But my doctor was delayed today, which gave me time to think about how alone I feel without my family by my side, and my nerve was irritated when a nurse used a needle to access my chemo port. I usually face a window, but this time my chair faced all those people in the room. Any semblance of calm I had at the beginning of the day was completely shot. I should have known better than to think that the difficult times were behind me. My doctors warned me that this is when the symptoms ramp up. I have to stop thinking that I’m somehow invincible or the exception to the rules. On Sunday evening, I felt a whole new level of stabbing and cramping pain as my stomach seemed to slowly drop out of my body. I yelled for my husband, who brought me anti-diarrhea medication and water. But after an hour, I started to wonder how I will know when the pain crosses from something I need to endure into more dangerous territory. My days are becoming consumed with fatigue. When I get home from my daily radiation treatment, I fall into a deep sleep. On Saturday evening, I was supposed to have a virtual happy hour with my friends. I had my glass filled with Gatorade, but then I put my head on a pillow on my husband’s lap. The next thing I knew an hour and a half had gone by and I’d missed it. And yet, when I go to bed at night, I can’t seem to stay asleep. I’ve been putting radiation burn cream on my skin to prevent rashes, and so far it has been working. I also haven’t gotten any mouth lesions from the treatment. Rinsing my mouth with salt, baking soda and warm water, followed by tea tree oil, five times a day is doing the trick. My doctor tells me that I should soon expect to start passing some dead tumor. He described it as looking like bits of dark, dying cells. I told him that I have two kids, so nothing I see in the toilet will surprise me. --- A few weeks ago, I started writing down everything me and my family are missing because of coronavirus and my cancer. I wanted to make sure we don’t let the many trips we usually go on disappear without at least paying some sort of homage to them. I’ve had to add James’ graduation to the list. She has autism, and after 15 years of school, she is weeks away from completing all of the typical school grades and the district’s transition program, which is basically life skills and job training. But now she and the rest of her peers won’t be able to celebrate that accomplishment the way they should. My husband and I haven’t really talked with James about her thoughts on all of this. In some ways we all feel like it’s another disappointment to add to the list. I hope one day soon that list will stop getting longer."
98,cancer,No-deal Brexit could hit cancer trials that save children’s lives,"Leading medical researchers have warned that their efforts to find new cancer treatments are likely to suffer major setbacks if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. In particular they fear that researchers based in the UK would face legal restrictions on working with other EU member states on clinical trials carried out across several countries. “This could be prohibitively costly to deal with and could mean UK-based organisations will be less likely to lead multinational trials, undermining the UK’s position as a global clinical research leader,” said Emma Greenwood, director of policy for Cancer Research UK. “It would be a considerable burden.” Newly established co-operative trials with other EU medical researchers have recently been raising hopes that advances can be made in treating relatively rare cancers. An example is provided by the paediatric hepatic international tumour trial (Phitt), which is seeking to test new techniques to treat children with rare liver cancers, and is part of a larger collaborative international project called the children’s liver tumour European research network (Chiltern). The €7.9m funding for these projects was supplied through the EU’s Horizon 2020 science funding programme. The leader of Phitt, Professor Keith Wheatley, of Birmingham University’s Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, said there were around 30 new cases of childhood liver cancer diagnosed in Britain every year. The disease’s relative rarity was welcome in one sense, he added. However, he also pointed out that the scarcity of cases poses problems for scientists seeking better ways to treat the condition. “If children are to have a chance of survival from early liver cancer, they often require intense bouts of chemo- otherapy,” he said. “But we do not know exactly how much chemotherapy – which can have very toxic side-effects – to give them. The trouble is that finding the answer is difficult because we have so few patients on whom to test out different regimes.” However, scientists recently set up international studies with hospitals in other European countries as part of the Phitt project. This will provide more patients, so scientists can set up trials involving hundreds of individuals and try out different chemotherapy regimes. It is hoped that Phitt will produce results within five years, leading to major improvements in treating childhood liver cancer. But the prospect of studies of this kind being set up to improve treatments for other cancers has been put in jeopardy by the threat of a no-deal Brexit. EU science funding would be likely to dry up for British scientists, and while the UK government has promised to make up the loss, medical researchers would still find themselves unable to collaborate so easily with European colleagues on projects such as Phitt and Chiltern. This point was supported by Greenwood, who said Cancer Research UK feared the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on cancer patients could be considerable. “It is going to become harder and harder to keep studies going and, even worse, to set up new studies to look at cancers that have not been tackled yet.” In addition to the problems that will afflict UK collaboration with Europe-wide cancer treatment trials, there is also likely to be serious disruption to deliveries of the tens of millions of items of medicine imported from the EU every month because of problems with setting up new border and import checks. Drugs for those needing routine hospital care would then be given priority, leaving medicines for relatively small-scale cancer trials at risk of being held up or blocked. Greenwood acknowledged that civil servants and National Health England had been working hard to try to offset the problems facing doctors and medical researchers, in particular in ensuring critically important medical supplies would be avail- able after Brexit. “However, we remain extremely concerned that something could go wrong,” she added. Scientists have also voiced concerns that the free flow of researchers needed to maintain first-class projects would also be threatened by a no-deal Brexit, despite government pledges to try to ease restrictions that are likely to be imposed."
99,cancer,Cancer patients in England 'diagnosed too late' due to staff shortages,"At least 115,000 cancer patients in England are diagnosed at an advanced stage each year, too late to have the best chance of survival, say experts. Efforts to improve people’s chances, by spotting tumours early on when they can be more easily treated, are being hampered by a chronic lack of skilled diagnostic staff, says Cancer Research UK.   Related: Charity highlights 'worrying' failure to improve cancer survival in England    The charity’s experts estimate that about 115,000 people who get cancer are already at stage 3 when it is detected, where the cancer may have started to spread, or stage 4, where it has reached other organs and is known as secondary or metastatic cancer. About 67,000 are diagnosed with stage 4 each year and their treatment options are much fewer. CRUK says the numbers may be even higher because there is no record made of the stage at which 19% of more than 300,000 new cancer patients a year are diagnosed in England. The government’s long-term plan for the NHS sets an ambitious target of three quarters of cancers to be picked up early by 2028 – at stages 1 and 2 when a cure is more likely. By that time, there will be an estimated 320,000 cancers, so at least 100,000 more will have to be caught early to hit the target. But, says CRUK, that is impossible without more staff. One in 10 diagnostic posts are vacant. “It’s unacceptable that so many people are diagnosed late. Although survival has improved, it’s not happening fast enough,” said Emma Greenwood, director of policy. “More referrals to hospital means we urgently need more staff. The government’s inaction on staff shortages is crippling the NHS, failing cancer patients and the doctors and nurses who are working tirelessly to diagnose and treat them. “By 2035, one person every minute will be diagnosed with cancer but there’s no plan to increase the number of NHS staff to cope with demand now or the growing numbers in the future. Saving lives from cancer needs to be top of the agenda for the new government and it must commit to investing in vital NHS staff now to ensure no one dies from cancer unnecessarily.” There are a number of reasons why cancers are advanced by the time people are diagnosed. Many people in the UK ignore their symptoms. “When we looked at international studies, they showed the British are somewhat peculiar compared with other populations in similar countries around the world in that we don’t want to bother the doctor. In great part it has to do with not wanting to waste the doctor’s time,” said Sara Hiom of CRUK. But that reluctance, responsible for up to one in four delays according to an audit last year, is fed by an awareness that the NHS is struggling to cope and does not have enough staff, she said. Innovations in testing and treatment which have been introduced in other countries are being held up in the UK by staff shortages, she added. These include scans for lung cancer and diagnostic tests for bowel cancer. By 2027, the NHS in England needs an extra 1,700 radiologists – people who report on imaging scans – increasing the total number to nearly 4,800; to triple oncologists who treat cancer from 1,155 to 3,000; and to recruit 2,000 more therapeutic radiographers, says CRUK. The radiology expert Dr Giles Maskell said they could feel the bottleneck tightening as the number of patients diagnosed with cancer mounted in line with the ageing population. “Extra scanners are welcome, but they will achieve nothing without staff to run them and experts to interpret the scans. It’s like buying a fleet of planes with no pilots to fly them,” he said. Trusts are working hard to meet cancer waiting time targets, said NHS Providers which represents them, but rising numbers of cancer patients, inability to invest in new machines and severe workforce shortages, particularly for endoscopists and radiologists, were all contributing to delays. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, blamed the government. “The stress and anxiety a patient facing cancer goes through is immense and these figures are a reminder that years of Tory cutbacks and understaffing has left patients not being seen on time, or waiting longer increasingly worried for test results,” he said. “Early diagnosis leads to better outcomes and so the government must urgently bring forward a fully funded staffing plan for our NHS.” Breast cancer charities said the delays were deeply concerning. “While more women are surviving breast cancer than ever before, there is unfortunately a stark difference in survival rates when women are diagnosed at a later stage, and we need to act now,” said Gunes Kalkan of Breast Cancer Care and Breast Cancer Now. The Department of Health and Social Care said: “Cancer is a priority for this government. Survival rates are at a record high and, in the NHS long-term plan, we committed to detecting three quarters of all cancers at an early stage by 2028. “We now have over 900 more diagnostic radiographers working in the NHS when compared with 2017, and the record £33.9bn extra we’re investing in our NHS every year will ensure we can support the health service with the staff it needs for the future.”"
100,cancer,Textured breast implants recalled from sale in Australia due to cancer concerns,"The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has launched a crackdown on textured breast implants following about 100 cases of a rare cancer, including four deaths, in Australia linked to the devices. In a statement, the agency said it would suspend eight types of breast implants – covering 13% of the Australian market – from sale for six months while safety and performance concerns are addressed. Un-implanted models will be pulled from the shelves. It comes as medical regulators grapple with concerns about breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), which has resulted in 23 deaths and more than 700 confirmed cases around the world. Under the new rules, manufacturers will be required to report all cases of the cancer linked to their products within 10 working days.   Related: Australian ban on textured breast implants recommended over apparent cancer link    The TGA did not suspend breast tissue expanders, which are mainly used for breast reconstruction surgery, while some micro-textured implants were also not suspended. The agency’s decision to impose new regulations is the result of a review into the breast implants and breast tissues expanders in which it conducted laboratory testing and a full statistical review of all BIA-ALCL cases. The decision to suspend some implant types mirrors the actions of regulators in France and Canada and follows a global investigation by the Guardian and other media organisations that revealed the widespread use of faulty medical implants. In Australia, breast implant sponsors will now be required to provide six monthly reports that include all adverse events and complaints related to its products. After the TGA commenced its review, two industry sponsors also cancelled the supply of their highly textured implants and tissue expanders. It will be illegal to supply, import, or export the suspended implants from 25 October. The regulator said it could revoked the suspensions if “the devices are addressed to the TGA’s satisfaction”. “If concerns persist, the suspension may be extended or the entries of the devices may be cancelled,” it said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning       In detailed comments on its website, the TGA said the removal of the implants was not required among those who have no symptoms or concerns. “For women who already have implants, the current consensus of expert opinion is that screening or prophylactic removal in asymptomatic patients is not recommended,” the TGA said. It advised women who detect a change in their breast or armpit, such as swelling, a lump or pain, to consult a doctor. Surgeons should disclose the risk of breast implant-associated ALCL when obtaining informed consent from a patient, the TGA said. The currently available data suggest that the risk might be reduced by using smooth implants. The new regulations were welcomed by the Australian Society of Plastic Surgeons, which described the TGA’s decision as a “reasonable outcome” and in line with its own recommendations. “These actions balance minimising risk for women seeking breast implants, while also ensuring women who require reconstructive surgery following breast cancer aren’t restricted in their options,” the society’s president, Gazi Hussain, said in a statement. “We have not opposed the suspension of the macro-textured breast implants as emerging data shows these represent the most common association with ALCL. “However, we are pleased that micro-textured, grade 2 breast implants remain available to women. The associated risk of ALCL with micro-textured implants remains low and if detected early is typically curable.” The Australian Medical Association was contacted for comment.

101,cancer,"Cancer researcher becomes first woman to win 4,000km cycling race","A German cancer researcher has become the first woman to win one of the world’s toughest cycling races in her first ultra-distance event. Fiona Kolbinger, 24, from Dresden, said she was “so surprised to win” the Transcontinental, which traverses 2,485 miles (4,000km) from Burgas in Bulgaria to Brest in France. She took 10 days, two hours and 48 minutes to complete the challenge, which included about 40,000 metres (131,000ft) of climbing. Kolbinger was one of 265 riders to begin the seventh edition of the race, which was started in 2013 by the British long-distance cyclist Mike Hall, who was killed during a race in Australia in 2017. Depending on their chosen route, participants can pass through Austria, Bulgaria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, France, Italy, Kosovo, Serbia, Slovenia and Switzerland. Riders are free to choose their own route, but must pass through four control points. Each checkpoint is accompanied by an obligatory specific challenge, from gravel tracks to high-altitude climbs and steep gradients. These included climbing the 2,474-metre Timmelsjochpass in South Tyrol on the border between Italy and Austria, and traversing the 2,645-metre Col du Galibier, one of the highest paved passes in the French Alps. Kolbinger, a medical student at the paediatric oncology unit at the German Cancer Research Centre in Heidelberg, was one of 40 women to start the race. “When I was coming into the race, I thought that maybe I could go for the women’s podium, but I never thought I could win the whole race … I think I could have gone harder. I could have slept less,” she said at the finish line on Tuesday. The clock does not stop after the riders set off from Burgas on 28 July. Competitors choose where, when and if they want to rest. Riders can only use what they take with them, or what they can find en route at commercially available services, and are not to accept help from friends or strangers. The weather was extremely variable, organisers said: “To complete the course, they’ve cycled through temperatures of up to 37C [98.6F] and as low as just four degrees above freezing. They’ve suffered under the scorching sun, freezing rain, and rode through thunder and lightning.” Though Kolbinger finished comfortably ahead of her nearest rival, Ben Davies, who was still on the road seven hours after she crossed the line, her overall time was not a record-breaker. James Hayden, a Briton, finished last year’s race in eight days, 23 hours and 59 minutes, finishing 24 hours ahead of the second-placed rider. He also won the 2017 event and came fourth in 2016."
102,cancer,Breast cancer risk from using HRT is ‘twice what was thought’,"The risk of breast cancer from using hormone replacement therapy is double what was previously thought, according to a major piece of research, which confirms that HRT is a direct cause of the cancer. The findings of the definitive study will cause concern among the 1 million women in the UK and millions more around the world who are using HRT. It finds that the longer women take it, the greater their risk, with the possibility that just one year is risk-free. It also finds that the risk does not go away as soon as women stop taking it, as had been previously assumed. The UK’s drug licensing body suggested women who have used HRT in the past or use it now should be vigilant for signs of breast cancer in the light of the findings, while the Royal College of GPs urged them not to panic but to consult their doctor if they are concerned. The research, published in the Lancet medical journal, says one in 50 women of average weight taking the most common form – combined daily oestrogen and progestogen – for five years will get breast cancer as a result. That risk is twice what was thought, because it continues at some level for 10 or more years after women stop taking HRT. There are about 1 million women in the UK on HRT, 5 million in the rest of Europe and 6 million in the US. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) said women who are taking or have ever taken HRT should be vigilant and may want to talk to their doctor next time they have a routine appointment. They should ensure they go for breast screening. “Women should be aware of this new information, so that it can be considered with the other risks and benefits of using HRT,” said Sarah Branch, the deputy director of the MHRA’s vigilance and risk management of medicines division. “The menopause can have unpleasant side-effects and HRT products can be effective in helping to ease the symptoms. No medicine is completely without risk, but it is important for women to be able to make an informed decision about the risks and benefits that are appropriate for them.” The MHRA recommends women should only take hormone therapy at the lowest dose and for the shortest possible time that works for them. The study shows there may be no increased risk for the first year. HRT has long been linked to breast cancer, and to a lesser extent to ovarian cancer as well. But the issue has been fraught with controversy, pitching supporters of HRT – including many gynaecologists – against the epidemiologists concerned about cancer risks. The British Menopause Society and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists have strongly defended HRT, which is very effective in alleviating the hot flushes, night sweats and other debilitating symptoms of menopause that can make one in four women’s lives miserable. They have disputed past studies linking HRT to cancer and claimed hormones have other health benefits, including protecting women from heart attacks and strokes, for which the authors of the new study say there is no evidence. HRT does help protect brittle bones, say the authors, but only while women are taking it. The British Menopause Society rejoiced at the recent guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice), which its members helped write. Nice suggested the risks were small – although without quantifying how small. GPs have been urged to prescribe HRT to more women as a result. “We really are concerned that many GPs have been saying it is not something you really have to worry about,” said Prof Valerie Beral from the University of Oxford, a co-author of the study. The scientists say the Nice guidelines should now be reconsidered. Nice said it is aware of the new research. “We will be reflecting on this study’s findings and considering it in our final decision as to whether we will update our menopause guidelines, a decision on which we will publish in due course,” said a spokesperson. Sir Richard Peto, professor of medical statistics and epidemiology at the Nuffield department of population health, University of Oxford, said they could now be certain that HRT is a cause of about 5% of breast cancers. The cancer risk increases with the length of time women are on hormones and the cancers tend to be oestrogen receptor-positive, which means they are driven by oestrogen. Women who are given drugs that dry up their oestrogen supply – like tamoxifen – get high protection against the tumours returning. “These are cause and effect relationships,” said Peto. “It is not just an association that exists, because the menopausal hormone therapy is causing the increase in breast cancer. “The big problem is how to describe the one in 50 risk,” he said. They did not want to exaggerate it, nor did they want to play it down. “On current websites, [the risks] are misrepresented,” he said. The paper, by the global Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer, pulled together data from 58 studies around the world on more than 108,000 women who had developed breast cancer after taking menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) – they say “replacement” therapy or HRT is a misnomer and a marketing description. In western countries, 6.3% of women of average weight will develop breast cancer over the 20 years from the age of 50 without any hormone therapy. The study found that rose to 8.3% among women taking the most common hormonal combination – oestrogen plus daily progestogen. The odds were better (7.7%) for women who took progestogen only intermittently, maybe for 10 to 14 days a month. Those who took oestrogen only, because they did not need progestogen to protect from womb cancer after a hysterectomy, had a risk of 6.8%. Women who are obese are at increased risk of breast cancer because their adipose (fat) tissue produces extra oestrogen after the menopause. The study found that taking HRT did not further increase their risk. Baroness Delyth Morgan, the chief executive of Breast Cancer Care and Breast Cancer Now, said the longer-term effect of HRT might be an important consideration for women. “Taking HRT is a really personal decision, and it’s vital that everyone fully understands the benefits and risks, discusses them with their GP and is supported to make the decision that’s right for them,” she said. “Rather than causing concern, we hope [the findings] will help anyone considering HRT treatment to make an even more informed decision.” Other scientists said the study was well conducted. Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at The Open University, called it “a very careful, thorough, excellent piece of research”. Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, called it “a tour de force in what has been done and the way it has been done – the findings cannot be dismissed”. But the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, in a joint statement with the British Menopause Society, said the findings were in line with the Nice guidelines that showed a “small increased risk”. “Women and doctors should be reassured that the findings of this study do not add anything new in terms of the effects of hormone replacement therapy. Research shows that, for most women, HRT helps to manage menopausal symptoms and is safe,” said gynaecologist Prof Janice Rymer, the vice-president of the college. “Women must be informed of the small increase in risk of breast cancer so they can weigh this up against the benefits that they may have from taking HRT. Every woman experiences the menopause differently and symptoms vary. These can be extremely debilitating and have a significant impact on a woman’s physical and psychological health, career, social life and relationships. Unfortunately, many women are still suffering in silence and are reluctant to seek advice and support due to concerns around the risks of breast cancer associated with HRT.” The Royal College of GPs urged patients not to panic and to carry on taking their HRT, and GPs to carry on as normal “until clinical guidelines recommend otherwise. If a patient is concerned about her HRT prescription, she should discuss it with her GP at her next routine appointment.”"
103,cancer,UK woman wins claim for NHS to pay US surrogacy costs,"﻿A woman who wants to have surrogate children through commercial agreements in California has won her claim that the NHS should pay for the treatment. The woman, identified only as XX, cannot bear her own children following earlier medical mistreatment. Whittington hospital NHS trust in north London has admitted negligently failing to detect signs of cervical cancer for more than four years. That oversight led to the woman developing highly invasive malignancy, which required chemo-radiotherapy treatment and left her infertile at the age of 29. She was awarded £580,000 in damages but further payments to cover the costs of surrogacies in California were refused because such commercial arrangements are illegal in the UK. XX, now in her mid-30s, has said one of her “central ambitions in life” is to have a family and that, despite the “profound, distressing and life-altering injuries” caused by her treatment, her loss of fertility is her “major concern”. Her lawyers argued during the hearing that she should be granted the costs of surrogacy in California, where the practice is legal and binding, saying that “in 2019, the civil courts should no longer have any role in censuring a woman’s reproductive choice”. In Wednesday’s judgment, delivered via video-link, a majority of three to two the supreme court found in favour of XX. Lady Hale, the former president of the supreme court who gave the majority decision, said: “The courts have bent over backwards to recognise the relationships created by surrogacy, including foreign commercial surrogacy. The government now supports surrogacy as a valid way of creating family relationships, although there are no plans to allow commercial surrogacy agencies to operate here. “It is no longer contrary to public policy to award damages for the costs of a foreign commercial surrogacy. However, that does not mean that such damages, still less damages such as are claimed in this case, will always be awarded. There are some important limiting factors. “ … The proposed programme of treatments must be reasonable. There may be good reasons to think that, but for the negligence, the claimant would have had the number of children now proposed, but there may not.” “Second, it must be reasonable for the claimant to seek the foreign commercial arrangements proposed rather than to make arrangements within the UK. This is unlikely to be reasonable unless the foreign country has a well-established system in which the interests of all involved, the surrogate, the commissioning parents and any resulting child, are properly safeguarded.” But delivering the dissenting judgment, Lord Carnwath said: “The fact that the laws of other jurisdictions and other systems may reflect different policy choices seems to me beside the point. It would in my view be contrary to [the] principle [of consistency between civil and criminal law] for the civil courts to award damages on the basis of conduct which, if undertaken in this country, would offend its criminal law.” Cara Nuttall, a solicitor in children and fertility law at JMW Solicitors, said: “Some people prefer to go abroad to undertake commercial surrogacy because it is generally quicker, as it removes the lengthy wait for an altruistic surrogate that many face when undertaking a domestic arrangement. “Much of the current law that governs surrogacy in the UK dates to the mid 1980s.... It has for some time now been accepted there needs to be a general overhaul of the law as it stands, to bring it in line with current social trends and advances in medical and scientific technology.  “Even when the original acts were passed they were done so in a hurried and reactive manner, and many in the surrogacy world are pleased that there is now widespread support for considered change, though with the Law Commission not now scheduled to report until next year at the earliest, it is clear any significant change is still some way away.” "
104,cancer,Breast cancer may be detected by blood test five years before clinical signs show,"Breast cancer could be detected five years before clinical signs appear in patients thanks to a blood test that could identify the body’s immune responses to tumour cells. That is the claim that has been made about research to be presented at a national cancer conference in Glasgow on Sunday. However, other cancer experts have warned these claims should be treated with caution. The study is the work of researchers at Nottingham University’s School of Medicine who focused on chemicals known as antigens. These are produced by cancer cells and trigger an immune response inside humans. In particular, they cause our bodies to make auto-antibodies that target and try to block those invading antigens. Researchers wanted to know if they could detect the presence of specific auto-antibodies in patients and show whether they had been triggered by antigens from tumour cells. So the team took blood samples from 90 patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer. They compared them with samples taken from a control group of 90 patients without breast cancer. Finally, the group screened the blood samples to see if they could detect auto-antibodies triggered by tumour antigens. The researchers correctly identified breast cancer in 37% of blood samples taken from affected patients. Crucially, they were also able to show that there was no cancer in 79% of samples from the control group. The results are considered to be highly encouraging by the group, which says they indicate that it will be possible to detect early breast cancer this way. “The results of our study show that breast cancer does induce auto-antibodies against specific tumour-associated antigens,” said Daniyah Alfattani, one of the Nottingham team. “We were able to detect cancer with reasonable accuracy by identifying these auto-antibodies in the blood. Once we have improved the accuracy of the test, then it opens the possibility of using a simple blood test to improve early detection of the disease,” added Alfattani, who will present the study at Sunday’s National Cancer Research Institute annual conference.    A blood test capable of detecting any of these cancers at an early stage is the overriding objective of our work  Daniyah Alfattani, researcher     “We have found that these tumour-associated antigens are good indicators of cancer. However, we need to develop and further validate this test.” Other researchers have urged caution in interpreting these results. “These are clearly very preliminary data,” said Cambridge University cancer epidemiologist Prof Paul Pharoah. “A lot more research would be needed before any claim can be made that this is likely to represent a meaningful advance in the early detection of cancer.” Warwick University molecular oncologist Prof Lawrence Young agreed: “While this is encouraging research, it is too soon to claim this test could be used to screen for early breast cancer. More work is needed to increase the efficiency and sensitivity of cancer detection.” The Nottingham team is now testing samples from 800 patients and expect the accuracy of the test to improve with these larger numbers. “A blood test for early breast cancer detection would be cost effective, which would be of particular value in low and middle-income countries. It would also be an easier screening method to implement compared with current methods, such as mammography,” said Alfattani. The researchers estimate that, with a fully funded development programme, the test might become available in the clinic in about four to five years. The group is working on similar tests for pancreatic, colorectal and liver cancers. Solid tumours such as these, as well as lung and breast cancer, represent about 70% of all cancers.   Related: Breast cancer risk from using HRT is ‘twice what was thought’    In addition, a similar test for lung cancer is being tested in a randomised controlled trial in Scotland, involving 12,000 people at high risk of developing lung cancer because they smoke. Participants who test positive for the auto-antibodies are have a CT scan every two years in order to detect lung cancer in its early stages when it is easier to treat. “A blood test capable of detecting any of these cancers at an early stage is the overriding objective of our work,” said Alfattani."
105,cancer,Cancer patient the first to die under Victoria's euthanasia law,"A Victorian woman has become the first person to end her life under the state’s new voluntary assisted dying laws. Kerry Robertson, 61, died at a nursing home in Bendigo on 15 July after almost a decade of living with cancer. Her daughters, Jacqui Hicks and Nicole Robertson, told the advocacy group Go Gentle Australia her death had been “beautiful and peaceful”. “It was a beautiful, positive experience,” the two women said. “It was the empowered death that she wanted.” Robertson was the first person to be granted a permit to end her life under the law, having visited her specialist the day legislation came into effect on 19 June.   Related: Assisted dying explained: Victoria's new laws, the safeguards and the Catholic resistance    Robertson was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010. Despite treatment, the cancer metastasised to her bones, lungs and brain. In March it spread to her liver and, as the side-effects of chemotherapy were no longer manageable, she decided to stop all treatment. “Mum has always been been brave – a real ‘feel the fear then do it anyway’ mentality to life – it’s the legacy she leaves with us,” Nicole Robertson said. “That was the greatest part, knowing we did everything we could to make her happy in life and comfortable in death.” The assisted dying process had taken 26 days to complete and went smoothly, the daughters said. Hicks said her mother had been “ready to go”: “Her body was failing her and she was in incredible pain. She’d been in pain for a long time. “Palliative care did their job as well as they could. But it had been a long battle. She was tired, the pain was intolerable and there was no quality of life left for her. “We were there with her; her favourite music was playing in the background and she was surrounded by love. She left this world with courage and grace, knowing how much she is loved.” The sisters said their mother’s death had reinforced their belief that anyone who was terminally ill and in intolerable pain deserved the choice of a voluntary assisted death. “It is the most compassionate, dignified and logical option for those suffering in the end stages of life,” Nicole said. The Victorian health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said the first use of the state’s Voluntary Assisted Dying Act was “an historic moment”. “The Victorian parliament legalised voluntary assisted dying so that Victorians with an insufferable, terminal and incurable illness can have a genuine and compassionate choice at the end of their lives,” she said. “Today we honour her memory and her bravery and we offer our sincere condolences to those who loved her.” The Voluntary Assisted Dying Act passed parliament in 2017 after a conscience vote supported by the premier, Daniel Andrews, and the majority of his cabinet. Patients are required to meet strict criteria to be eligible, including having a terminal illness with no more than six months left to live, or 12 months if the patient has a degenerative neurological condition. To be approved, patients must have two doctors sign off on their application and make three requests. Andrew Denton, the director of Go Gentle Australia, said Robertson’s story demonstrated how well the law had been designed. “The eligibility criteria were met, the safeguards were worked through and Kerry Robertson and her family were offered the compassionate death Kerry wanted,” he said. “Importantly, too, access to the process was not an issue, even though the family was from regional Victoria. It is a testament to the dedication and compassion of everyone involved.” The government expects up to 150 people a year will use the scheme. Similar laws are being considered in Western Australia and Queensland."
106,cancer,Ex-cabinet ministers join cross-party call for charities hardship fund,"The former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith and ex-Conservative cabinet ministers have joined calls for an emergency hardship fund to help struggling charities, as hopes grew that the government could unveil such an initiative on Wednesday. 
Ministers have been under pressure for weeks to extend the financial help offered to businesses to the third sector, amid reports that even the most established organisations are in dire straits as revenue from charity shops and fundraising events dries up during the coronavirus lockdown. 
A letter signed by 26 MPs from across the political spectrum, including the former Conservative cabinet ministers Liam Fox, Esther McVey, Owen Paterson and Damian Green, called on the government to save the small charitable and community sector “from impending collapse” and to rescue the “silent army of life savers”. 
“We have seen firsthand their significance in the fight against coronavirus. They provide the infrastructure of voluntary effort to support the most vulnerable, facing greater hardship than ever at this time. Isolated households, those with mental health problems, people experiencing domestic violence, child abuse, loneliness and the extra stress of family dysfunction,” the letter said. 
“They are delivering medicines and food to the most vulnerable and in the case of adult and children’s hospices, they are also taking the pressure off our hard-pressed NHS and social care sectors, or stemming the flow of people who would otherwise need more intense medical care in hospitals and much, much more.”

With the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, expected to front the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing on Wednesday, sources in the voluntary sector said they had been told to expect an announcement on Wednesday – though some said they had been told that before. 
There have been reports that the Treasury was preparing a £100m fund for charities, but this figure has been dismissed as inadequate by many in the sector. By contrast, Barclay’s bank announced on Wednesday it planned to donate £100m to charities helping in the coronavirus crisis. 
Cancer Research UK was among a number of leading cancer charities to warn on Tuesday that a shortfall of donations would set back progress on fighting the disease. The organisation said it could lose up to a quarter of its donated income (about £120m) in the next 12 months, meaning it had drastically to scale back its research plans. 
Sue Ryder, one of the UK’s biggest providers of end of life care, has similarly warned it may have to close its hospices after the coronavirus crisis blew a £12m hole in its budget. St John Ambulance, which has deployed hundreds of volunteers around the NHS to help tackle Covid-19, also told MPs last week it would run out of money in the next four months.

107,cancer,Indonesia's much-loved disaster agency chief dies of cancer,"Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, Indonesia’s highly regarded disaster agency spokesperson, a man who continued to provide updates on the country’s inordinate number of natural disasters even as he suffered lung cancer, has died aged 49. Sutopo, known affectionately across the country as Pak Topo, an amalgamation of the Indonesian word for mister and an abbreviation of his first name, had been undergoing cancer treatment in the Chinese city of Guangzhou.   Related: Indonesia's love affair with its dying natural disaster spokesman    The news was confirmed by Indonesia’s disaster agency and Sutopo’s eldest son, Ivanka Rizaldy. “Tonight, a hero and my beloved father, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, has returned to God while undergoing treatment in Guangzhou, China. To all friends and family, we ask for your forgiveness and prayers for Pak Sutopo. Thank you for everything you have given me Pa, I will always pray for you,” he wrote on his social media account, alongside a family portrait, with his father, mother and younger brother. Known for his indefatigable commitment to the job, personal mission to combat fake news, as well as his quirky sense of humour, as often displayed on his Twitter account, Pak Topo was hailed as “true servant of the nation” by Indonesian social media users on Sunday, including by the president, Joko Widodo:    Innalillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun.

But last year Sutopo revealed his own personal disaster, announcing he had stage-four lung cancer and might not survive a year. With a string of deadly earthquakes in Bali and Lombok in August, and a catastrophic tsunami in Palu on the island of Sulawesi, which killed more than 2,000 people last September, 2018 was one of the worst on record for disasters in Indonesia. Even as he became increasingly gaunt and unwell, Sutopo remained deeply committed to his job, writing press releases from his hospital bed, drip in hand, or in between bouts of chemotherapy. In an interview with the Guardian last November he said he thought about quitting, but couldn’t bring himself to do it. “I thought, my illness is my fate, I was destined to it, so I have to keep working, it is my responsibility,” he said, “When a disaster hits I have to share that information quickly, in any condition. As long as it gives benefit to people, I do my job whole-heartedly. Every job, if intended with heart, will have good results.” In a show of how much he was loved, when the Guardian visited him a large table in Sutopo’s office was covered with a mountain of packages from across the country filled with medicines and tinctures from well-wishers he had never met. There were so many packages, he noted, he would never get the chance to open them all. Sutopo, who was born in Boyolali, in central Java, the son of a schoolteacher and typist, studied geography at university, earning a doctoral degree from Bogor Agricultural University. “Life isn’t determined by how long we live, but how useful we are to other people. That’s what I do,” Sutopo told the Guardian last November, “Although the doctors say that I don’t have so much time left, in my last days, I want to try to do good, to be useful. That’s so much better than having a long life but making people miserable!”"
108,cancer,'I'm very frightened': lives on hold as NHS surgery postponed due to Covid-19,"Thousands of patients across the UK are having operations called off indefinitely as the government and NHS gear up for the peak of coronavirus infections. 
For many this means prolonged pain and discomfort, fear and emotional turmoil, cancelled plans and loss of earnings. For some, it might be life-threatening. 
Maggie Hollick, 67, from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, was due to have a cancer operation on 20 March. “I had a malignant melanoma removed five years ago, but unfortunately this has now metastasised and spread to my right lymph nodes,” she said. 
After she discovered a lump in October and had various tests, it was decided she should have the lymph nodes removed at the Queen Elizabeth hospital, in Birmingham, at the earliest opportunity. 
But two days before the operation, Hollick was told her surgery had been called off, as all available resources were needed to cope with the coronavirus crisis. 
“The lovely surgeon rang me and explained how sorry he was, but said that no operations at all, not even urgent ones, were able to go ahead in Birmingham. I asked him what would happen if this spread so far in my body that it became terminal in the meantime. He said he was unable to answer,” she said. “I am very frightened.” 
Hollick has not been given a new date for her operation, but was told it could be weeks or even months away, and that she and one other patient would be the next ones to be dealt with. 
“My family and I are so anxious about this, and I am desperately ringing around trying to find if I could have this operation done privately, which probably won’t be an option.

“I feel I can’t just be written off like that. I don’t know where to turn. It’s a desperate, dire situation,” she said. 
Hilery Williams, 68, a retired teacher from Edinburgh, was due to have much-needed hip replacement surgery on 24 March. She was transferred to the Golden Jubilee hospital, in Clydebank, because the waiting list there was shorter, and her doctors pressed for the earliest possible slot for her, as they considered her case a priority. 
“The Jubilee is a hospital which does not do emergency surgery. The Scottish government tweeted on about 9 March that there were no plans to use the hospital for the coronavirus. But on Wednesday, the hospital phoned and cancelled my surgery until further notice,” she said. 
Williams is in a lot of pain and practically immobile. 
“I’m a huge supporter of the NHS, and of course completely understand. But I am disappointed. Since the deaths of my parents and my son’s suicide last year the pain in my hip has grown exponentially,” she said. 
Yet, she considers in a better position than many. “I am still very fortunate. I may not be able to walk any further than from the front door to the car, but I have a partner, I have some money, I will be OK.”

Michael Ward, 38, a university lecturer from Cardiff, has been waiting for six months for an urgent gallbladder removal that had been scheduled to take place on 13 April. But on Friday, all NHS routine operations in Wales were cancelled. 
“It’s been a two-and-a-half year journey of pain, continuous burping and belching and stomach issues, and numerous tests,” Ward said. He can no longer eat many foods and has lost about two and a half stone. “I did have a cry of relief when my appointment letter came through, it was wonderful,” he said. 
“I have been taking a lot of pain medication, went to A&amp;E with a panic attack last November. I got sent away with some Gaviscon, they were totally overwhelmed even then. Eventually, my gallbladder will stop working, and I don’t know when that will be.” 
Since January, he has been able to go into the university only once a week. “My colleagues have been really supportive, and have made it possible for me to work from home four days a week since the beginning of this semester,” he said. “My students are important to me, it’s a very frustrating situation, and there’s no end in sight.” 
 
  
  
   
    
    Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:
    
     a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back
     a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly
    
    NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;stay at home for at least 7 days.
    If you live with other people,&nbsp;they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.
    After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.&nbsp;Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.
    If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.
    If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.
    After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.
    If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.
    If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.
    Staying at home means you should:
    
     not go to work, school or public areas
     not use public transport or taxis
     not have visitors, such as friends and family, in your home
     not go out to buy food or collect medicine – order them by phone or online, or ask someone else to drop them off at your home
    
    You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.

Julie Courtis, 62, from Richmond-upon-Thames, has been caring for her 24-year-old daughter since July last year, when she suffered a complicated displacement fracture after a fall at a tube platform. 
“She shattered her tibia and had five hours of surgery, two plates and 13 pins inserted. She was due to have an operation on Friday to repair the cartilage damage and remove the metalwork, and to address the constant pain she is in,” Courtis said. 
Two days ago, the operation was cancelled. 
“My daughter was confined to her room for months, with her leg extended. At first her mobility was so limited she could not make it to the bathroom. It took three months to get her into a car. Her recovery came to a halt three months ago,” Courtis said. 
“She has been on very strong painkillers and has not been able to complete her dissertation for her master’s degree,” she added. “It could be a lot worse, of course, but you know. Her life is on hold.”

109,cancer,UK cancer survival rates are too low – our priorities are all wrong,"Cancer survival rates in the UK have long lagged behind those in other countries of comparable wealth and income levels. And an international study published this week shows that while the UK is making rapid progress, there’s still a big gap in the survival rates cancer patients can expect in Britain compared with countries such as Australia, Canada and Norway. The good news is that the outlook for patients suffering from major forms of cancer has got much better. On an age standardised basis, fewer than half of patients with rectal cancer in the UK lived more than five years in 1995. By 2014, more than 60% did. And we should take the bad news with a pinch of salt because comparing cancer survival across countries is so inherently difficult. There is a risk that some countries look as though their patients are more likely to live extra years just because they have started counting sooner.   Related: NHS oncologists are being offered shares in private hospitals. This must stop    But this isn’t an isolated finding: the UK performs consistently poorly in international studies, suggesting there is something very real to worry about. The gaps are not small: if people in the UK survived at the same rate as those in Austria or Canada, 20 in every 100 people with lung cancer would live for five years, instead of 13 in every 100. For some cancers, the international gap doesn’t even appear to be closing. So why aren’t patients in the UK living as long, and what can we do about it? Attention often falls on the expensive and dramatic aspects of cancer treatment: proton beam machines and breakthrough medicines. Other explanations focus on the state-funded nature of the NHS – ignoring the fact that many of the better-performing countries use the same model. Experts who have studied possible reasons for worse performance in the UK have concluded that it may have more to do with subtle everyday behaviours of doctors and patients that influence how fast diagnoses can be made. Studies have found British patients are more likely to be reluctant to come forward with symptoms than in countries that largely have better cancer survival rates. Compared to people in Scandinavian countries, Australia and Canada, they were most likely to worry about wasting their doctor’s time. British GPs are also less likely to refer people to hospitals for further tests – and this is statistically linked to worse survival rates. You can always blame the alleged culture of the “stiff upper lip”. But it is also not difficult to see why the NHS might incentivise doctors and patients to be constantly mindful of scarce resources. The NHS has fewer of nearly all types of staff than its counterparts overseas, relative to the number of patients. It also seems to have far fewer scanners than comparable countries we looked at in western Europe, the Anglosphere and the G7 – around seven MRI machines per million people, compared to an average of almost 20. It has a low number of hospital beds as well. The recent NHS long-term plan includes a battery of measures to improve cancer survival. It emphasises earlier diagnosis, and specifically aims to “lower the threshold of referral” so that symptoms are investigated more readily. A review of screening is monitoring how well current programmes work and what the future should be. These are in line with where the problems appear to be. But we should also reflect on the deeper reasons we ended up here. The NHS has often suffered from short-termism, with low levels of investment compared to its peers. Last year Theresa May announced an extra £20.5bn for the day-to-day running of the service. But there was nothing extra for the budget that funds investment and equipment, which has been raided repeatedly in recent years. Although the government has since pledged to put more money in, we at the Nuffield Trust have warned that much of this is just allowing trusts to spend money they already have – which they need for repairs after years of austerity, leaving little to spend on new projects. The budget for staff training has also suffered, and seen only partial relief, despite spiralling shortages of both nurses and the radiographers who scan people for cancer. Politicians in the UK tend to talk a great deal about NHS waiting times – which actually seem to be fairly average compared to other countries. Our performance in keeping people alive, which has some serious shortcomings, often takes second place. This week’s study shows rapid improvements in cancer care are possible, and the NHS is capable of making them. But we need to take a long, hard look at our priorities if we want to improve quickly enough to close the gap with other countries, and give British cancer patients a chance as good as any. • Mark Dayan is a policy analyst at the Nuffield Trust"
110,cancer,Compulsory maths could teach students credit card smarts and how to choose cancer treatment,"Many of the most important decisions we need to make as adults – about our finances, our health and how we engage as citizens – can be greatly helped by mathematical understanding. New South Wales has decided to make maths compulsory for years 11 and 12 to ensure adequate “numeracy” in all graduates. Universal numeracy is a great goal, however many of us adults who do not have careers in science and engineering probably struggle to see how our high school trigonometry and calculus have been handy in our daily lives. What about how we were told that even if we did not use these specific mathematical concepts they would improve how we think more generally? The field of cognitive science – my field – has at the very best found mixed evidence of this.   Related: Our teachers are working harder than ever before. Why don't we value them more? | Jane Mueller    Given the previous generation’s experience, it makes sense to be sceptical of compulsory maths. Data science is a large element of my work and yet one of the happiest moments of my adolescence was when I decided not to take year 12 mathematics. Why force unwilling kids to grit their teeth through solving differential equations? Although the announcement did not include curriculum specifics, the NSW education department suggests that everyday use of mathematical thinking is a central concern. This emphasis on skills relevant for adult life and careers outside the natural sciences and engineering is apparent in the standard maths curriculum, and with a program called “life skills”. In the recently released NSW curriculum review it is suggested that education focuses on proficiency standards – the idea that all students achieve a base level of subject understanding before graduating. This is a promising step. It is important to have a curriculum that supports as many students as possible in future careers in maths and science while ensuring others are equipped with the mathematical knowledge they will need to function in other fields and daily life.    Just how much more money does a billionaire have than I do? The difference is much greater than many people estimate    One area where low numeracy has clear negative effects is in financial decisions that concern how money accumulates over time (such as the long-term advantages of making contributions to superannuation). Low numeracy is also associated with underestimating how long it will take to pay off credit card debt. Of course, given short-term economic pressures some people may opt to go into debt with complete understanding of its long-term effects, so public numeracy alone is not a financial cure-all. But it is one piece of the puzzle, and one that our public education can directly address.  A second critical area where public numeracy needs to be improved is in medical and health decision-making. For example, with a cancer diagnosis there may be multiple treatment options, all with different risks and different chances of success. How can someone navigate these decisions without an understanding of probability and statistics? Or in less immediately dire circumstances, how should someone decide whether to change their diet based on new scientific findings? One has to understand what any specific risk level means. For instance, when the World Health Organisation announced it was as certain of the links between processed meats and cancer as it was of smoking and cancer, there was widespread confusion. Here it is important to understand the difference between the degree of certainty in some causal relationship (eg that X causes cancer) and the size of that effect (eg how much more likely someone is to get cancer if they do X). When the size of an effect is quite large, it is typically easier to be certain that the effect is real, but these are separate statistical concepts and the public conversation around these kinds of findings tended to confuse the two. Eating processed red meat daily does not increase the risk of cancer to the same degree as smoking daily, even if the certainty is similar. A third arena where practical statistics understanding is beneficial is in our work lives. Imagine you are in retail and you track your daily sales. Every day this number is going to change from the day before. How much change is “just random” and how much change indicates something meaningful? Distinguishing the random from the meaningful, or finding the signal in the noise, is the goal of statistical analysis. Of course, some companies are big and savvy enough that they hire data scientists with this exact kind of expertise, but most small to medium businesses cannot do this. However, the basic maths of determining signal from noise can be taught at the high school level. The calculations behind the basics are simpler than trigonometry or calculus, but the concepts need to be properly taught. My experience with undergraduate statistics students suggests a better job can be done preparing them in high school. A final area is in civic engagement and politics. Numbers are often thrown around in headlines and political speeches, such as “there are $1bn in cuts to the university sector” or “the national debt is over $1tn”. What do any of those numbers mean in the massive scale of a federal budget? How should I decide whether or not I like a budgetary decision made by people I can vote for that actually takes into account the maths? One  study suggested that about half of Americans think one million is halfway between one thousand and one billion, as if the counting list of “thousand, million, billion, trillion” represents equal differences in magnitude as you go through the list. One area where this numerical misunderstanding is a problem is in considering income inequality. Just how much more money does a billionaire have than I do? The difference is much greater than many people estimate, which can also lead to underestimating how many public services could be improved by increasing taxes on the ultra-wealthy while still leaving them with much more money than the rest of us.   Related: Australian high school students clueless about emergency contraception    On the whole it seems compulsory maths education for years 11 and 12 is a good thing, but setting the curriculum standards alone will not solve all the problems of decision-making in the real world. For one, the same concepts can be taught more or less well. Cognitive science and education research has extensively shown which instructional methods are most effective for teaching key mathematical concepts, but implementing best practices in all classrooms remains a challenge. Beyond anything anything educational, however, it is important to recognise that any individual’s cognitive abilities will not be a cure-all. Someone can completely understand the trade-off between spending now and saving for later but still choose to spend now because of the precariousness of their economic situation. Or for another angle on this issue, avoiding a daily $15 cafe breakfast will not change the ratio of numbers of available jobs to the number of unemployed people. Maybe if the older generation had proper education in the maths that really matters to most people they would understand that. • Micah Goldwater is senior lecturer at the school of psychology, University of Sydney"
111,cancer,Naturopath who said bicarbonate soda cures cancer banned for life by health watchdog,"A naturopath who told vulnerable clients that their cancer was a fungus that could be cured with bicarbonate soda rather than through conventional medical treatment has been barred from practising for life, according to the New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission. Barbara O’Neill describes herself as a qualified naturopath and nutritionist and has worked at health retreats in Queensland, Victoria and NSW. She gives lectures internationally, has authored books on health and nutrition, and appears in YouTube videos. The HCCC found: “Mrs O’Neill does not recognise that she is misleading vulnerable people including mothers and cancer sufferers by providing very selective information.”   Related: It's time to inject some sense into the nonsense peddled by the anti-science crowd | Melissa Davey    “The misinformation has huge potential to have a detrimental effect on the health of individuals as Mrs O’Neill discourages mainstream treatment for cancer, antibiotics and vaccination,” the commission’s decision, published in October, found. The commission’s investigation found O’Neill never held any membership with any accredited professional health organisation and had failed to obtain any relevant health-related degrees or diplomas. According to the investigation she also failed to keep records of consultations with clients, falsely claimed to be able to cure cancer, did not treat clients in a safe or ethical manner and posed a risk to the health and safety of members of the public. She has been permanently barred from providing any health services either voluntarily or in a paid capacity, including giving lectures. It comes after the commission received numerous complaints about O’Neill between October 2018 and January. These included complaints about dietary advice for babies that O’Neill published on her personal website which, if followed, would lead to the child’s death or injury. According to the HCCC’s decision, O’Neill told the commission the dietary advice was based on her own experiences and she had never read the National Health and Medical Research Council’s infant feeding guidelines for health workers, which provide evidence-based recommendations. A complaint was also received by the commission after O’Neill allegedly gave a lecture promoting the discredited theory that cancer is a fungus. The investigation found she encouraged clients to remove essential food groups from their diet such as fruits and carbohydrates, and to instead use probiotics and bicarbonate wraps to treat their cancer. According to the investigation, O’Neill falsely claimed in one lecture that a doctor had a 90% success rate curing cancer with sodium bicarbonate injections. She produced no evidence to support the statistic.   Related: Homeopathy not effective for treating any condition, Australian report finds    According to the HCCC, O’Neill also gave advice based on theories from medical doctors who have been sued by their former patients for failing to treat them appropriately, including one doctor who was found guilty of manslaughter. The HCCC noted that after being informed by the commission of these legal cases, O’Neill said she would continue to use the advice from those discredited doctors in her lectures. The HCCC found that she also told her clients that following her treatments would be more successful if they gave up chemotherapy and other conventional treatments. The HCCC noted that O’Neill frequently told the commission that she did not give clients advice, but merely provided them with information. The HCCC said this information included telling pregnant women not to take antibiotics for streptococcus B infections because “no baby has ever died from Strep B catching out of birth”. However, statistics from the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists indicate early-onset Strep B has a fatality rate of 14% in neonates, a risk that can be reduced by 80% with antibiotics. The commission found that O’Neill is a member of the Seventh Day Adventist Church and usually delivered health lectures to congregants at church-organised events, and also lectured overseas and performed telephone consultations for a fee. The commission said she had no authority to provide advice in “highly complex and specialised areas such as cancer treatment, use of antibiotics for Strep B and immunisation”.

112,cancer,"Game of Thrones, cancer and me…","The strangest thing about getting bad news is that your mind doesn’t quite act in the expected ways. When my oncologist told me that my triple negative breast cancer, diagnosed in 2017 when I was 44, had metastasised, spreading to my liver and was now stage 4 and incurable, the first thought that popped into my head, after the initial throat-closing “I don’t want to leave Kris and the kids”, was what if I never find out how Game of Thrones actually ends? You may laugh – and I did sitting in that sterile appointment room in front of my concerned oncologist and the lovely nurse I’d forever now think of as my own angel of death. It was such an incongruous thought at such a serious time. Yet it also seemed like a legitimate concern. For once I’d thought about Game of Thrones, then all the other things I might never finish rushed through my mind. The series left incomplete, the music I might never listen to, the plays I’d never watch, the conversations I’d never have about books I’d never get to read. Even the possibility that my football team, Tottenham Hotspur, might actually reward a lifetime of faithful trudging to White Hart Lane and Wembley by winning something (I am nothing if not an optimist at heart). It feels morbid to be thinking this way – after all, my cancer is currently incurable but not terminal – and yet I can’t deny that every time I read about a film that’s coming next year or the new book by an author I’ve loved, my initial response is not to think, “Oh great, I can’t wait for that,” but instead to wonder if I’ll still be here when it arrives.    We talk a lot about fighting cancer. Less often about living with and, eventually, dying from it    Yet it’s important to acknowledge those thoughts, grim though they might seem. We talk a lot about fighting cancer, and about surviving it, too. Less often about living with and, eventually, in all probability, dying from it. Since last October when I learned that the cancer had spread, this has been my reality: a daily grind of living with a chronic illness – blood tests, steroids, chemotherapy every three weeks, scan after scan after scan. It’s true, too, that no one reacts in the same way to getting a stage 4 cancer diagnosis. There are those who overhaul their diet; who throw out the red meat, the bars of chocolate, the bags of crisps and dedicate their lives to an improving diet, cooking beautiful meals made of kale and turmeric and blueberries and who feel, and often look, much better for it. There are those whose first thought is to exercise; who head to the gym and pound the pavements and show, repeatedly and admirably, that their bodies are as strong and fit as they were before. And there are those whose overwhelming urge is simply to get into bed and stay there. There are people who investigate every possible way of staying alive and people who think: “Sod it, I’m going to live my life as I always have and see what happens next.”     ‘I’d never really been a fantasy reader, but from the first page I was hooked.’ Illustration: Phil Hackett/Observer    My response when I learned that the cancer was now incurable fell somewhere between all of those stalls. I’d like to say that the news was shocking enough that I immediately began planning a health overhaul in order to stay alive as long as possible, but the reality is that I am naturally a pretty lazy person and when I heard my oncologist say that at this point treatment was a marathon rather than a sprint, all I could think was that I was terrible at long-distance running at school, but pretty good at pelting for the bus, which didn’t exactly bode well. I am not naturally good at dealing with attempts to talk about my health, however well meaning. For a time, when people would bring up my bad luck, sighing sympathetically with their heads cocked to the side, I would nod extra sincerely and agree that yes, it was terribly bad luck, but on the other hand, I’d been very lucky both in love and on the horses and you can’t have everything going your way. That’s not to say I haven’t taken my diagnosis seriously. It’s more that while I have made some effort to eat more plant-based food, have started walking distances every day and am flirting with everything from swimming to yoga, it was – and is – easier for me to live each day much I as did before. People tell you that when you get this kind of devastating news, conversations take on an almost burnished intensity, you hug those you love harder, live in the moment, love what is left of your life more. It’s true, but what they don’t say is that sometimes, despite all the treatments, the hours spent giving blood, taking pills, sitting through chemo, the occasionally bone-shattering tiredness… sometimes you forget you even have stage 4 cancer at all.    Sometimes you forget you even have stage 4 cancer at all    It’s in those moments that popular culture rushes in. When I was first diagnosed I turned to Jilly Cooper, rereading first her early romances then all the Rutshire Chronicles from Riders to Mount! During chemo I ploughed through boxsets, from Peaky Blinders to Derry Girls. Post-mastectomy I survived on a diet of Dorothy Dunnett’s Lymond Chronicles, Donna Tartt’s The Secret History, Leigh Bardugo’s Grishaverse books and Sally Beauman’s family house saga Dark Angel. When reading proved too difficult, thanks to a combination of morphine and pain, I watched old TV series, such as Glue and newer ones like Save Me – one of the best things about a lengthy stay in hospital is the chance to catch up with all those programmes you meant to get round to finishing but never quite managed. Looming over everything, however, was Game of Thrones, George R R Martin’s epic tale about life, death, murder and politics in the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. Not simply because, entering its final season, it remains television’s one true juggernaut, the biggest, most bombastic show of them all, but because if one piece of popular culture could be said to have dominated my life for the past 15 years it is this one. Even writing that feels weird. Martin’s sprawling creation is not my favourite story, nor do I think that either it or the subsequent HBO adaptation are the greatest pieces of art ever made, much as I love them both. But there are some pieces of popular culture that, by some weird alchemy, can come to dominate your life – and Game of Thrones has, both for good and bad, dominated mine. I first came across the series A Song of Ice and Fire almost two decades ago in my 20s when I was doing sub-editing shifts in any office that would take me. It was the sort of grinding, monotonous work where you moved from office to office, week after week, and no one really talked to you because you’d soon be gone. Lonely, I spent every lunchtime in nearby cafés reading A Game of Thrones, the first of Martin’s books, which I’d picked up initially because of its size. I’d never really been a fantasy reader, but this was fantasy with a political bent and, crucially, it was big enough to pass the time. From the first page I was hooked.     ‘It might seem like an overstatement, but writing those recaps of Game of Thrones helped restore life to me.’ Illustration: Phil Hackett/Observer    Some books can do that, providing the literary equivalent of a shot of adrenaline to the heart and making sure that you turn the pages long into the night and first thing in the morning. I finished A Game of Thrones in a gulp, sighing over the fate of the Starks and laughing at Tyrion Lannister’s bitter one-liners, and promptly moved on to the second book in the saga, A Clash of Kings. I was lucky because the year was 2000 and the third book, A Storm of Swords, had just been published. I had no idea how long I would then have to wait for volumes four and five. If I had then I would perhaps have paused before devouring it. What happened next happened partially because of the time. The early noughties was an era of message boards, of the discovery that you could find people who shared your interests and obsessions and talk to them all over the world, and about the most obscure points. So it was that while slacking off during another lengthy subbing shift (this one at night) I discovered the Westeros message board, A Forum of Ice and Fire. In an age before social media dominance, it transformed my world, bringing me into contact with people across the world and allowing me to hear their opinions and thoughts on everything from obscure points of Westerosi law to real-life global politics. I spent the night of the 2004 US election talking to a Game of Thrones fans about what would happen and debated politics with people in Memphis and Mumbai. I was given recommendations for everything from books and films to where to eat and drink in cities throughout the world. It seems so minor now, but at that time it felt as though the whole world had come closer and anyone could have a say. The arrival of the television series in 2011 kicked everything up a notch. I covered the press junket for the first series and was asked by the Guardian to write a series of weekly recaps of the show. The request came at a very difficult time in my life – three days after the junket my third child was stillborn – yet it also gave me something to cling on to. Barely capable of work, there was a bleak comfort in losing myself in the power struggles of the Seven Kingdoms, this graphically brutal world where no one could be trusted and where words were the sharpest weapons of all. It might seem like an overstatement, but writing those recaps helped restore life to me. I loved arguing with the commenters about what had happened and what might happen next. I relished the pressure of having to get each recap online in such a short space of time, as well as the chance to truly lose myself in a fictional world. I think about those days a lot right now – it’s hard not to, given my health. On bad days it can seem monstrously unfair to have had two stillbirths (the second was in 2012) and an incurable cancer diagnosis in eight years. I’ve found some solace in sitting in church – I grew up Catholic and the faith of my childhood is a useful crutch at difficult times, even if I’ve never been the most devout of practitioners. It helps, too, in my darker moments, to acknowledge that the treatment I’ve received has been exemplary, from my pragmatic oncologist Dr Laura Kenny to the funny, honest and, above all, incredibly patient nurses on the oncology ward at Charing Cross hospital and the many, many people there and at Hammersmith hospital who have patiently tried to extract blood from my recalcitrant veins. And, despite all the difficult times, I’d be lying if I said that the last decade hasn’t been the best of my life. I’ve been lucky in love, fulfilled in my work, surrounded by friends, laughed more than I ever thought possible at the most ridiculous of things. I can say with absolute honesty that I have had a lovely time and I don’t regret any of it, not even those dark and slightly desperate days in my late 20s when I mistook the ability to drink long into the night for personality and saw more charm in a series of older men than they ever genuinely exhibited.    And, despite all the difficult times, I’d be lying if I said that the last decade hasn’t been the best of my life    It’s true, too, that the less time you think you may have left in this world the more you want to intensely experience it. Over the past months I have been intensely grateful for walks with my dog, giggling hugs from my children, Ruby, 11, and Oisín, 9, coffee with my parents, trips away with my two siblings and more silly conversations with friends than I can count. For uncontrollable laughter and fantastic sex and, most of all, for all the many moments that my husband Kris has raised an eyebrow and told me to get over myself and stop auditioning for a part as a dying swan. I think a lot, too, about something that the late Andrea Levy, author of Small Island and The Long Song, apparently said. That when breast cancer stopped being treatable and became stage 4 and incurable, she realised she didn’t want to spend what was left of her life in a room writing. She wanted, instead, to live. I understand that and yet I want both. I want to cling to every moment, but I also want to read and watch everything I can. Call it a manifesto for the chronically lazy perhaps, for those of us who have always liked to spend our time in darkened rooms transfixed, as all that is great and terrible about human life parades across the screen, but if I spend what is left of my time lying on a sofa reading I won’t feel that I have missed out. Best of all, while I might not find out how Martin himself intends to finish his series (there are still two long-awaited books to come), I will almost certainly see the TV series of Game of Thrones return for its brutal, no doubt bloody and hopefully rewarding conclusion this month. As for Tottenham Hotspur winning the league in my lifetime, that remains too great a step for even the most benign of gods to arrange. • Season eight of Game of Thrones starts on 14 April 2019"
113,cancer,Cancer Town: Rev William Barber challenges presidential hopefuls to visit,"The social justice and moral revival campaigner Rev William Barber has called on 2020 presidential candidates to visit Reserve, Louisiana, the town with America’s highest risk of cancer due to airborne toxins.

Barber took part in a two-day tour of toxic pollution sites in southern Louisiana as part of his national Poor People’s Campaign. Last month he drew several prominent Democratic 2020 candidates, including Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders, to an event in Washington. 
“If you cannot come here to Reserve, then you don’t have any business being president,” Barber said on Saturday. “If you can’t come here to Cancer Alley, you don’t need to be at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.” 
Barber, who is also president of Repairers of the Breach, was speaking at the entrance to the Pontchartrain Works facility, a chemicals plant in Reserve that is the primary cause of a cancer risk 50 times the national average. 
Flanked by members of the Concerned Citizens of Saint John the Baptist, a parish advocacy group fighting air pollution, Barber added: “These folks are not anti-job or anti-industry. They’re anti-death. They’re anti-being-killed when it doesn’t have to happen.

Reserve is the centre of a year-long Guardian series, Cancer Town, exploring air pollution in St John the Baptist parish and other communities between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, a stretch of land known as cancer alley. 
“It made us feel like we aren’t in this fight alone,” said the Concerned Citizens president, Mary Hampton. 
The Pontchartrain Works facility is the only place in the US that produces the synthetic rubber Neoprene, which contains the primary constituent chloroprene, listed by the Environmental Protection Agency as a likely carcinogen.

The plant is owned by the Japanese chemicals firm Denka, which purchased it from the US chemical giant DuPont in 2015. DuPont had run Neoprene production at the site since 1964. 
Barber visited another plant in neighbouring St James parish, the Uncle Sam plant operated by the fertilizer company Mosaic. The facility is home to a 200ft reservoir of acidic wastewater encased in walls of trace-radioactive gypsum.

“That monstrosity is one of the greatest threats we face in southern Louisiana,” said Robert Taylor, director of the Concerned Citizens of Saint John the Baptist, gesturing at the imposing walls. 
Barber and assembled residents also discussed the history of the land along the Mississippi where chemical plants now sit. Nearly all of it was once given over to sugar and rice plantations. 
“So they went from plantations to plants, killing people with contamination,” Barber said.

The tour came the morning after a town hall in New Orleans, co-hosted by the Poor People’s Campaign and the Guardian, to discuss the impact of pollution in the region. 
In a panel session attended by community members, local politicians and environmental scientists, Barber pledged to make pollution issues in Reserve a central part of his campaign. 
“We have to drive this into the public narrative,” he said. “We have to drive this into the public consciousness, and that part of the reason why the Poor People’s Campaign is here.” 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
On Thursday, a study published by the University Network for Human Rights found that residents in Reserve have been diagnosed with cancer at “highly unusual” rates. The report was dismissed by Denka, which had not been shown its findings. 
“From what we have learned, the study appears to be based on individual interviews rather than scientific analysis of actual cancer incidences,” a Denka spokesman, Jim Harris, said. 
The company has long disputed the dangers presented by chloroprene and is currently lobbying the federal government to change its “likely carcinogen” status."
114,cancer,Endless Sunshine on a Cloudy Day review – touching tribute to an Instagram influencer,"This feature from actor-director John Connors won the audience award at this year’s Dublin film festival, and it’s a generous, big-hearted, honest tribute to the McCann family from Greystones, County Wicklow, who endured a public heartbreak. In 2018, daughter Jade had become a beauty influencer on Instagram; her profile assumed a new dimension when she started documenting the way her dad, Anthony, a former boxer, was dealing with his prostate cancer. Things became even more complex when Jade was diagnosed with sarcoma, and she began talking in the same artless way about that. Connors intersperses his own black-and-white footage of Jade and Anthony (and her mum, Kim, and brother, Eoin) with Jade’s own Instagram videos, which are shot portrait-style, often in her car, with text and wacky emojis.              We can see how the Panglossian self-promotional rhetoric of social media, with its habitual filtering and airbrushing, is coming into contact with something darker and more unmanageable. Often, Connors will include updates about the way Jade’s follower count is fluctuating – perhaps because the public was unsure how to take what she was telling them. It’s a touching film, precisely because it has a rough-and-ready, homemade quality. Jade is no more of a narcissist than anyone else on social media, and there is a heartrending openness about what she is trying to do. If there is a fault in this film, it is that it does not analyse clearly enough what it means to go through such a tough experience in the real time of social media. Specifically, it could have been more candid about what type of trolling Jade had to withstand – that was clearly an issue – and how she reacted to what appear to have been shifts in public opinion. But there is something affecting in the simplicity of this film, which has a sadness and sweetness. • Endless Sunshine on a Cloudy Day is available to stream on Vimeo."
115,cancer,Man from Sidcup runs marathon in his garden,"A man in south-east London ran a marathon in his garden to raise money for a cancer charity after the government said people should stay local for exercise. 
James Page, 36, from Sidcup, had been in training for an ultra-marathon in the Sahara desert, along with the London Marathon, but both were postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Rather than letting his months of training go to waste, the pipe fitter did 873 laps of about 50 metres in his garden – clocking up more than 26 miles – in a gargantuan effort on Friday which has helped him beat his fundraising target for Children With Cancer UK. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
“It wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be,” he told the Guardian. “In a weird way it was quite enjoyable. It was nice weather and the kids were out there watching me with my wife.” 
The government has advised people to stay local for exercise and not to travel unnecessarily, and Page took this guidance literally. During the 4 hour and 57 minute marathon, he regularly refuelled with water, electrolytes, nuts, gels and sweets, while switching direction every 20 minutes to protect his knees. 
“I wanted to go a bit quicker and get a personal best, but it’s hard to pick up speed as you’re running in such a small circle,” he said. “I’m not the fastest runner, but I had to keep it at a nice comfortable speed otherwise it would be tricky at the corners.” 
Both of Page’s parents were diagnosed with cancer in the past 18 months and though they both appear to have beaten the disease, the road to recovery is an ordeal he would not want anyone else to go through. 
“My mum got the all clear on the same day my dad got diagnosed with bowel cancer,” he said. “Mum has to be really careful now, and my dad’s doing really good now, he’s got over the worst of it.” 
Page’s son created a toilet-roll finish line for his father, which has been the source of some jovial criticism online due to shortages, while his wife is not pleased about the damage to the lawn.

“You can really see the loops trodden into the grass,” he said. “My wife’s not really happy, but she knows it was for a good cause and it keeps me happy.” 
Children With Cancer UK is organising the Together as One run, which is due to take place on 26 April, the original day of the London Marathon. 
It is encouraging people to use their daily exercise to run wherever they can in the UK between 9.30am and 10.30am to raise money for childhood cancer research."
116,cancer,Taking a stanza: Simon Armitage cancer poem engraved on a pill,"Simon Armitage’s latest poem, a “bullet / with cancer’s name / carved brazenly on it”, is yet to be printed or read aloud by the poet laureate from the stage. Instead, the work has been engraved by micro-artist Graham Short on to a 2cm x 1cm chemotherapy pill, in what Short said was probably the hardest job had had ever done. Entitled Finishing It, the poem – Armitage’s second as poet laureate – was commissioned by the Institute of Cancer Research in London. It is intended to symbolise the new generation of cancer treatments that the Institute’s planned Centre for Cancer Drug Discovery will create, and which it hopes will turn cancer into a manageable disease. “I can’t configure / a tablet / chiselled by God’s finger,” writes Armitage. Instead, the poet has crafted “the sugared pill / of a poem, one sentence / that speaks ill // of illness itself”.  Running to 51 words, the poem was given to Short to engrave on a replica chemotherapy pill, which is intended to represent the drugs that the Institute hopes to develop in the new centre.     ‘Here’s an inscription’ … one side of the pill engraved by Graham Short. Photograph: John Angerson    “The pill kept crumbling and it was so difficult to do,” said Short, who swims 10,000 metres a day to lower his resting pulse rate, and works from midnight to 5am to avoid vibrations from passing traffic. “I work in an unusual way, wearing a stethoscope and taking tablets to get my heart rate down to 20-25 bpm. What I’m trying to do then, using very fine needles, is engrave between heartbeats.” Short’s tablet will be displayed in the Centre for Cancer Drug Discovery when it opens in 2020. Currently under construction – and still requiring an additional £14m in donations to be completed – the centre is intended to bring together hundreds of scientists to collaborate on a programme that will overcome cancer’s ability to develop resistance to drugs.     ‘It was so difficult to do’ ... Graham Short. Photograph: John Angerson    Armitage said: “Science and poetry are closer associates than many people assume, and it was exciting to work on a project that deals with cutting-edge medical research. And like science, poetry is a ‘what if’ activity, imagining outcomes and possibilities based on creative thinking. “I liked the sense that poem and pill might collaborate to produce both a medical and emotional cure, and that something so minimalist could aim to bring down something so enormous and destructive. I experimented for a long time with the language – the shortest poems are always the hardest to write, their smallness making them so much more conspicuous and vulnerable.” Dr Olivia Rossanese, who will be head of biology in the new centre, said that Armitage’s poem “beautifully shares our story and symbolises the hope of what’s to come, the message made more powerful by being engraved on a pill that represents the kinds of treatments that we will be developing in the very near future”. The centre, she added, would “offer a completely new and remarkable way of working”, with computational biologists, geneticists, evolutionary scientists and drug discovery researchers “all working hand-in-hand in an unprecedented way”."
117,cancer,Cancer survivor is first person to swim the Channel four times non-stop,"Swimming four lengths does not sound like a particularly impressive achievement. But when those lengths add up to nearly 134 miles (215km) in the open sea, and when they have been completed by a breast cancer survivor a year after treatment, they look more like an extraordinary world first. 
Over 54 gruelling hours from midnight on Sunday until dawn on Tuesday, the American ultra long-distance swimmer Sarah Thomas, 37, became the first person to swim the Channel four times without stopping. Thomas dedicated her achievement to fellow breast cancer survivors. 
Thomas’s feat was accomplished in the face of strong tides that extended a route that had originally been expected to cover 84 miles, far less than the distance she eventually completed. The British endurance swimmer Lewis Pugh described the achievement as “extraordinary” and “superhuman”. 
She was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer in November 2017 and underwent chemotherapy, surgery and radiation. Thomas’s support team said she used swimming as a means of coping. 
In a Facebook post, a member of her team said the conditions on the final leg were “dark, windy and choppy”. 
They added: “This is supposed to be the most challenging leg of the swim so please keep up the good vibes you’ve all been sending her way.” 
Thomas celebrated her success with champagne and chocolates. An official observer said she had tested the limits of endurance. “It is amazing, absolutely inspirational. At the end we were very emotional,” Kevin Murphy said. 
Thomas told the BBC: “I just can’t believe we did it. I’m pretty tired right now.” She said she planned to sleep for the rest of the day. 
Before the swim, Thomas admitted she was scared of the challenge. “I’ve been waiting for this swim for over two years now and have fought so hard to get here. Am I 100%? No,” she said. “But I’m the best that I can be right now, with what I’ve been through, with more fire and fight than ever.” 
 
 Record Channel swim graphic 
 
Thomas, whose achievement puts her ahead of the four people to have previously completed the Channel crossing three times without stopping, said the swim was dedicated to “all the survivors out there”. 
Thomas completed her first open-water event in 2007 – a 10km swim in her home state of Colorado – and went on to become the overall champion of the race. In 2016, she also set a distance record of 128.7km in 56 hours, non-stop, across Lake Powell in the US. 
“This is for those of us who have prayed for our lives, who have wondered with despair about what comes next, and have battled through pain and fear to overcome,” she said. 
“This is for those of you just starting your cancer journey and those of you who are thriving with cancer kicked firmly into the past, and for everyone in between.” 
Thomas’s mother, Becky Baxter, said the attempt had been “scary” at times because her daughter was unable to keep down liquid on the first day. She had been suffering with the effects of the salt water, which had left her throat and mouth sore. 
“This one was by far the scariest one and right up until she landed at Shakespeare Beach in Dover we didn’t know for sure that she would make it,” Baxter told BBC Radio 4. 
“She had a lot of trouble with stomach ache and she did lose her lunch several times. And we were a little worried towards the end of the first day, during that night, because she was not able to hold anything down – water, anything. But we slowly built her back up.” 
She said Thomas had sustained herself during the swim by drinking a bottle of carbohydrate shake every 30 minutes. “It is tied to a rope and we are on the boat. She drinks a third of that bottle in 10-15 seconds and then she takes off again. Sometimes she’ll eat solid foods, but we had a lot of trouble finding something that agreed with her on this trip,” Baxter said. 
“She is a freak of nature. She really had to dig deep to finish this. She could have quit many, many times. There were several obstacles, but she never quits. 
“In the last 400 metres into the beach, she was caught in the tide and was just not going anywhere. And so we had to do some screaming and yelling and get her to dig deep and she found it after all that time. I’m pretty proud of her.” "
118,cancer,'It was quite intimate': a tiny funeral for a big family man,"Postcards from the pandemic is a new series that looks at how everyday Australians are coping with immense changes coronavirus has brought to their lives. Bert Cattermole, riddled with cancer, switched on the TV to find out the latest news about the coronavirus. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, was announcing a further tightening of restrictions, including the “very difficult” decision to limit attendance at funerals to 10 people. Bert turned to family members caring for him and said without fuss: “Oh well, that’s you seven [children] and three more.”     A screen grab of Bert Cattermole’s funeral, which was livestreamed to the friends and family who couldn’t be there because of coronavirus restrictions. Photograph: Oneroom    Early the next morning, Bert, 82, died in his recliner chair. For the Cattermole family, like others throughout the country and the world, Covid-19 has brought a further layer of grief to losing a close family member. It’s the “no touching” that seems cruel. No embraces, no arm around a shoulder, no comfort for the weeping.   Related: Postcards from the pandemic: The future's still bright but home school due to coronavirus is tough in your final year    Jane Cattermole, 58, the fourth of Bert’s eight children (one sibling is not in contact with the family), helped look after her father at her sister Ann’s house in the final days. For such a large family – Bert had 24 grandchildren and 34 great-grandchildren – it was especially difficult. Visits were limited to the adult children. “Some of the grandkids did visit but mainly we were strict about that,” says Jane. “We FaceTimed so the grandkids could have a chat with him when he perked up a little bit. Most of them rang up and said goodbye to him over video.”     Bert Cattermole with his children Photograph: Jane Cattermole    The limit of 10 at a funeral is extraordinary but Australia has so far imposed less severe restrictions than some countries. In Italy and New Zealand funerals are banned. Bert had no religious convictions, but for those who do, the rituals around burial are ancient. Muslims, for instance, wash the body, wrap it in a shroud, and hold communal prayer. Under Covid-19 health department guidelines, close handling of the body is not recommended but it can be done under strict conditions. They advise that families should not kiss the deceased. The days after someone dies are always strange. Apart from the emotion and exhaustion of it, there’s so much to be done. The siblings comforted each other from afar, and the meeting with the celebrant was on FaceTime. The funeral was held in Baldivis, a suburb of Perth, at 10am last Friday. Ten cream chairs were set up in the chapel, all spaced apart. Jane was the first in, followed at a distance by nine others (the Western Australian government allowed 10 family members, plus two officials). There were seven of Bert’s children – Margaret, Paul, Ann, Jane, Andrew, Angela and James – and three of their partners. The celebrant, Kevin Clune, told the tiny gathering that “without the needs of our current stage of containing Covid-19, this chapel would be overflowing”.  During this crisis, modern technology is helping maintain connection, even at funerals. It was livestreamed so family and friends could watch. Every life is unique, every family complicated. Jane’s eulogy outlined her father’s life, from his days as a Yorkshire coalminer, marrying Mary at a young age, and bringing their rowdy mob of kids to Australia in 1975 as “10-pound poms”. Mary died a few years ago and Bert nursed her to the end. A kidney donation from a 13-year-old boy saved Bert’s life and he savoured the two decades it gave him. He was a “good, decent, fair and generous man”, Jane says. When he was encouraged to go off all drugs towards the end, to surrender to death, he refused to stop taking the anti-rejection medication that protected his kidney. “He wanted to honour that little boy and his family to the end.”      Her father had at first struggled to accept Jane’s and another sister’s sexuality, treating their same-sex partners with coldness. That changed, and in his final days of life he apologised for his early intolerance. “He wanted us to know that he loved us and always had.”   Related: Postcards from the pandemic: losing a business and a life purpose    The rituals of a funeral were all there. Bert’s closest friends, Olive and Noel Grafton, could not attend owing to the restrictions, but Angela read out a letter from them to honour more than 40 years of friendship. A poem was read on behalf of the grandchildren. Bert’s favourite song, Tom T Hall’s Old Dogs, Children and Watermelon Wine, filled the chapel. Towards the end of the service, Jane reached over and threw her arms around Ann. It was against the rules but Jane does not regret it. “Ann just cried the whole way through,” she says. “She was the one whose house he was in. It was so sad, and she just lost it a little bit.” One day, when all this is over, the Cattermole family plans a big celebration of Bert’s life; when all the family and friends can be there, and everyone can tell stories and hug each other. They understand that it has to wait.     Bert Cattermole and family in the Doncaster Gazette Photograph: Doncaster Gazette    “We never would have expected his last days and funeral would occur this way,” Jane says. “Other generations have had to deal with different hardships and we’ve just got to deal with this.” The family’s biggest fear was that the funeral would somehow seem makeshift, not a “proper” funeral. But it felt real.

119,cancer,Japanese owners of plant at heart of US Cancer Town refuse to meet activists,"Lydia Gerard and Robert Taylor never came close to losing their composure, even when it became clear that their 7,000-mile journey from the southern United States to Japan was about to come to nought.   interactive   Denied even the courtesy of a brief meeting – in a country fabled for its levels of civility – with representatives of a Japanese company they blame for spewing a toxic chemical into the air above their home town, they listened patiently as uniformed guards repeatedly told them to turn around and leave – immediately. They had walked together through the lunchtime drizzle to the gleaming high-rise housing the headquarters of Denka in central Tokyo, clinging to the hope that on this, their second trip to the Japanese capital in three months, they would be given the chance to make their case to the people best placed to end their town’s misery. Less than a week earlier, Gerard, 65, and Taylor, 79, had left Reserve, Louisiana, with a single aim: to present evidence to Denka, a Japanese chemicals company, that its plant’s toxic emissions are responsible for unusually high rates of cancer and a litany of other diseases in their hometown. Instead, during an unannounced visit to Denka’s headquarters, they came up against a wall of silence during an attempt to meet the firm’s representatives. Surrounded by security guards before they could enter the company’s premises, Gerard and Taylor were told that no one from Denka was prepared to talk to them or accept a copy of a University Network for Human Rights (UNHR) study published in July that found that residents near the plant, operated by Denka’s US subsidiary, have contracted cancer at unusually high rates. One census tract next to the plant has the highest cancer risk anywhere in America due to airborne toxicity, 50 times above the national average, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).     Lydia Gerard and Robert Taylor in Tokyo. Photograph: Justin McCurry    After repeatedly being told to leave, Gerard broke her silence. “We live next to the Denka plant in Louisiana, and we have lots of concerns. We want to give them this information,” Gerard, whose husband, Walter, died of cancer last year, said to security guards in front of the building’s second-floor reception area. Walter was diagnosed with the disease two years before the 2015 release of the EPA report.  After failing to get a response, Gerard tried again. “Could someone from Denka please come down and receive this,” she said, referring to the health study by the UNHR, a US-based civil society group that organised their trip to Japan. Surrounded by guards and several men in business suits who could not be identified as their lanyard IDs were facing inwards, she added: “We don’t want to talk to them or receive any information, we just want to hand this to someone from Denka.” The toxic emissions in Reserve, a town in St John the Baptist parish – a predominantly black, working-class community – come primarily from the Pontchartrain Works facility, the only place in the US to manufacture the synthetic rubber neoprene. Reserve is the focus of a yearlong Guardian series, Cancer Town, examining the fight for clean air in the town, as well as other communities in the area between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, known colloquially as Cancer Alley.      The former Dupont, now owned by Denka chemical plant located in Reserve, Louisiana, on 11 July 2019. Photograph: Bryan Tarnowski/The Guardian    The US government considers chloroprene, the primary constituent of neoprene, as likely to be carcinogenic to humans. The Japanese government, however, does not class chloroprene as a dangerous chemical, and no public records are kept on chloroprene emissions in Omi, on the Japan Sea coast, where Denka runs the only plant in the country that manufactures the chemical, but via a different process than the one used at its plant in Reserve. When the group travelled east of Tokyo to Chiba prefecture, home to a large Denka chemicals plant, staff told them that the facility did not produce chloroprene and politely declined requests for an impromptu guided tour of the facility similar to those offered to local schoolchildren. The Reserve plant, originally built by the US chemicals giant DuPont, went into operation in 1968. The firm sold it to Denka just before the damning EPA report was published in 2015. Speaking to journalists at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Japan the day before their fruitless visit to the Denka HQ, Gerard, who was born close to the plant and raised a family there, said her husband “had always been healthy, and we believe that [his cancer] was the result of chloroprene from the Denka facility. “We don’t want to move. The plant has to bring emissions down, or it has to move. It’s Denka’s responsibility to be good neighbours, but they don’t see the need to bring emissions down. There is no reason why they can’t do what is necessary.” Taylor and Gerard, accompanied by Ruhan Nagra, the executive director of UNHR, found their paths blocked by security guards as soon as they entered the second-floor lobby that houses the Denka headquarters. The confrontation, witnessed by the Guardian, lasted about 25 minutes and ended after a stocky man in dark sunglasses who appeared to be head of security repeatedly asked the three to “leave the building immediately” and refused to accept and pass on the UNHR study. The standoff was a repeat of an unsuccessful attempt Taylor and Gerard had made to enter a Denka shareholders’ meeting during their first visit to Japan in July.  “They won’t talk to us,” said Taylor, whose adult daughter, Raven, is ill with a rare intestinal disease – gastroparesis – that he said doctors had tied to chloroprene. “This is the way they treat us – like we’re nothing. We get the same from DuPont and Denka even though they’re in my front yard, and from the governor of Louisiana. This strategy is pointless – they’re never going to allow us in there. We’re seen as the low-hanging fruit because we are the least able to protect ourselves.” At least one security guard followed Taylor, Gerard and Nagra to a subway station on the opposite side of the road. Outside in the drizzle, Gerard reflected on another unsuccessful attempt to engage with the company she blames for the cancer that killed her husband. “This all goes to show what big business feels about people like us,” she said, sheltering beneath an umbrella. “They don’t want to hear what we have to say. They all want us to go away and be quiet. But we’re not going to do that.” But she and Taylor voiced hope that their visit would generate more interest in their plight in Japan, where the media have largely ignored the claims made against the company. Following their most recent visit, a major daily newspaper and a weekly business magazine have reportedly said they plan to run articles on the issue. UNHR did manage to secure a meeting with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), which helped finance Denka’s purchase of the DuPont plant.   Related: 'Almost every household has someone that has died from cancer'    JBIC officials refused to discuss its involvement in the Denka project, however, citing ongoing litigation involving Denka, according to Nagra. At its meeting with Nagra, Taylor and Gerard, the bank would only talk in general terms about the procedures it follows when financing projects, she added. The JBIC classifies the Denka plant as a category C project, meaning that it has determined that the plant “is likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impact” and requires no environmental review or monitoring. JBIC representatives refused to discuss why the bank had selected that classification when pushed by Nagra. It is not clear if a C classification would prevent Reserve residents from filing a complaint via the JBIC’s in-house grievance process. Minutes after he and Gerard were left with no choice but to leave the Denka building, Taylor struggled to hide his bitterness towards the company – for its refusal to countenance that it is responsible for dangerously toxic air, and for its apparent disregard for the victims and their families. “We’re so insignificant to them that they set the dogs on us to prevent us from going in,” he said. “To talk to us would be to admit that we’re human. It’s like they’re saying, ‘We can dump anything we want on your community and you have to sit down and let it happen.’”"
120,cancer,I started chemotherapy in the middle of a pandemic,"I have been dreading my first chemotherapy appointment. I started radiation treatment a couple of days ago, and the 15-minute sessions (in which I lie on my back as a big machine rotates around me) didn’t bother me much. But the idea of having to sit passively as toxic drugs are slowly funneled into my body has kept me up at night. The doctors told me that three days after the first treatment, the side effects will really start to hit me. A nurse told me about possible hearing loss. It’s a scary prospect as I pride myself on my bat-like hearing. She also asked whether I have a separate bathroom that my husband Eric and our two kids won’t use, because 24 hours after my first dose, my urine and sweat would start to become toxic. At that moment, the enormity of my situation came barreling through the walls of the hospital and hit me. I’m trying to keep me and my family safe from a deadly virus, which means staying inside and away from sick people. But I’m also trying to keep myself from dying of cervical cancer, which requires not only going to a hospital almost every day, but pumping toxic drugs into my system that I then bring home with me.   Related: 'What a terrible time to have cancer': falling ill during the coronavirus crisis    The drive to the hospital for the appointment this morning took a fraction of the time it normally does. It was 9.15am and the roads were empty, except for a few drivers who seemed to have forgotten the meaning of a red light. Since Washington’s stay-home mandate came into effect to prevent the spread of coronavirus, the streets of Bellevue have been reduced to dog walkers and a very busy pick-up line for grocery store orders. My husband, Eric, dropped me off at the front of the hospital. I started feeling hot and sweaty, and I was breathing harder than normal. Several security guards were stationed just inside the entrance. I was told to stand in line on a blue piece of tape that kept everyone six feet apart from one another. A pair of nurses wearing long hospital gowns, masks and gloves asked if I’d had diarrhea in the last 72 hours, had been coughing or having trouble breathing. Then they took my temperature.     Heather Chaney’s front gate. Photograph: Grant Hindsley    As I walked over to the elevator, I noticed all of the side doors had been blocked off or were guarded by a hospital staff member. I used my sleeve to hit the elevator door, and relaxed a bit when no one else followed me inside such a confined space. On the second floor, nurses led me to a large chair that reclines and even has buttons for a built-in massage and heating. They gave me pillows and a blanket, and there was some cheese and fruit set out. I could see five other people getting treatment, but we were all spaced far apart from one another. I scrolled through Facebook and Twitter, watched some of the governor’s press conference and then put in my headphones to listen to the Hamilton soundtrack. With my 15-year-old son’s asthma and Eric’s artificial heart valve, we agreed no one would come with me into the hospital for these appointments. It was not an easy decision. But to be completely honest, as scared as I have been, the prospect of getting a four-hour break from my family was actually pretty appealing.    The barrage of questions just wouldn’t stop: Did I wash everything off? Did I bring something home today?    We’ve been cooped up together in the house for the past two weeks, except for occasional walks, doctors’ appointments and grocery store order pick-ups. My son, Michael, has started having weekly online movie nights with his friends, and both he and my daughter, James, who has autism, have been drawing a lot. They’re really good artists. I’m not sure where they get it. I can’t even write my name the same way twice. The doctors gave me anti-nausea medicine and steroids, so I felt a strange combination of tired and energized when I got home. Last night, I had fallen asleep on my living room couch at 4am, a little earlier than my new normal these days. The barrage of unending questions just wouldn’t stop: Did I wash everything off from the hospital visits? Did I bring something home today? How many days do I have before I start to feel sick? My doctor gave me a prescription for Xanax, so I hope that will help. I’ve never been on any type of anxiety medication before. But when we met in his office, with my chair set noticeably farther away from his desk, we both agreed that this was the right choice. My dad died two days ago. It had nothing to do with coronavirus, but it was sudden. He lives in Idaho and we haven’t spoken in five years for a number of reasons, including the fact that I knew he wouldn’t be able to accept my kids after they came out as LGBTQ. But I have been worried about how my three younger siblings are handling this, since they were close with him. One day after his death, Idaho’s governor announced a shelter-in-place order, which means they won’t be able to have a real funeral. I’ve been in touch with my siblings a lot recently, to try and help them as they clean out dad’s house. It’s actually been nice because it makes me feel like I’m doing something. I feel relieved that I no longer have to wonder about what will happen during chemo. I made it through the first appointment, so I know I can make it through the next four more. I’m still terrified about what the next few days and weeks will bring, but hopefully getting over that hurdle will be enough to calm my worried brain, at least for one night."
121,cancer,NHS patients being fed bacon with cancer-causing nitrites,"Meat cured with chemicals that have been blamed for causing certain types of cancer are on the hospital menus at more than four-fifths of NHS trusts, according to new research. The revelation has triggered cross-party calls for the NHS to take action. Data obtained via a Freedom of Information request reveals that 113 NHS English foundation trusts include nitrite-cured bacon and ham in the meals they offer patients. Of these, 12 admit to offering patients meat containing potassium nitrite. Just 14% of trusts in England are nitrite-free, while the remaining 5% either refused to disclose the contents of their patient meals or failed to respond to the request for information. “It is concerning that so many hospital meals contain nitrite-cured meat, given the wealth of evidence that has been published linking these chemicals to colorectal cancer,” said Conservative MP Sir David Amess, who chairs the cross-party parliamentary group on food and health. “It is the responsibility of our NHS to lead by example and so I would urge these foundation trusts to remove nitrites from their menus as soon as possible. With the development of safer alternatives, it is clear nitrites don’t need to be added to pork anymore to make our bacon and ham,” Amess said. Labour’s former shadow environment secretary, Kerry McCarthy MP, described the figures as extraordinary: “Serious questions must be asked of these NHS foundation trusts. It cannot be acceptable for patients to be admitted to hospital, only to be fed cancer-causing meals while they are in there. “With the advent of safer nitrite-free alternatives it is about time these trusts and the government move to remove nitrites from their menus at the earliest possible opportunity.” In 2015, the World Health Organisation (WHO) linked 34,000 cases of bowel cancer every year to the consumption of nitrite-cured processed meats. Concerns have seen some food producers, such as Finnebrogue and Nestlé, start selling nitrite-free ham and bacon products. Many of the NHS groups that use meat treated with nitrites claim the chemicals are essential to protect against botulism in food products. However, an internal report produced for the British Meat Processors Association – seen by the Observer – found that nitrites appeared to be ineffective in preventing the spread of clostridium botulinum bacteria. It has now emerged that the European commissioner responsible for health and food safety, Vytenis Andriukaitis, has ordered a review of the levels at which nitrites are legally permitted to be added to meat. The intervention was requested by Professor Denis Corpet, who co-authored a WHO report on nitrites, and wrote to Andriukaitis, and health secretary Matt Hancock, urging them to intervene."
122,cancer,Starwatch: a good time to track down the Crab," Starwatch chart 28 March 2020   This week is a good time to track down one of the fainter constellations: Cancer, the Crab. It is one of the zodiacal constellations, meaning that the sun passes through it during the year. It is bordered on the west by Gemini, the Twins, and to the east by Leo, the Lion – both zodiacal constellations.  Its faint stars mean that a reasonably dark sky is needed to see it. Near the centre of the constellation lies the Praesepe star cluster, also known as the beehive cluster. This is visible to the naked eye as a small patch of misty light.  The chart shows the view looking south from London, UK, in the evening. All this week, Cancer will be well placed for observation. It will be at it highest in the sky around 21:00 GMT, when it crosses the north-south meridian line. From the southern hemisphere, Cancer is also easily visible at this time of year. Look for it in the northern sky during the evening."
123,cancer,"Morning mail: PM's climate no-show, Brexit fears, good news on cancer rates","Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 12 September. Top stories Scott Morrison will not attend the UN climate action summit this month, despite being in the US at the same time. The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, will represent Australia instead. Speaking slots at the event in New York were reserved for countries announcing new emissions reduction targets or financial commitments to the UN Green Climate Fund. A spokesman for Morrison said: “Australia has already outlined our policies to tackle climate change, including cutting our emissions by 26-28%.” Meanwhile Labor has accused the Coalition government of a “full-frontal assault” on renewable energy, after new investment figures revealed a reversion back to 2016 levels in the sector for the first half of 2019. A no-deal Brexit could result in rising food and fuel prices, disruption to medicine supplies and public disorder on Britain’s streets, according to secret documents the UK government has been forced to publish by MPs. A five-page document spelling out the government’s “planning assumptions” was disclosed on Wednesday, and proved strikingly similar to the plan leaked last month, which the government dismissed at the time as out of date. Meanwhile the government has rejected demands for an immediate recall of parliament after a Scottish court ruled that Boris Johnson’s five-week prorogation was “unlawful”. Australia has better cancer survival rates than other similar high-income countries, a global study has found. The study reviewed 3.9m cancer cases of seven types from Australia, New Zealand, the UK, Norway, Ireland, Canada and Denmark. Australia had the highest five-year survival rate in all but lung and ovarian cancer. The chief executive of Cancer Council Australia, Prof Sanchia Aranda, said the higher survival rates could be attributed to earlier detection, which she said was due to the management of referral and screening services in Australia.

And while its demise might be welcomed by some feminists for its reinforcement of white beauty standards, writes Yomi Adegoke, it’s not necessarily a victory for so-called progressives. “The sad thing is that the current purge is happening at a time when women’s magazines are less sexist and more progressive than they ever have been. But in a media landscape that tends to characterise interests generally associated with men as ‘news’ while women’s issues are often shoehorned into ‘lifestyle’ pullouts and supplements, their absence is keenly felt and their presence still very much needed.” As many Australians are now working multiple jobs as are unemployed. It’s a remarkable insight from the newly released job figures, writes Greg Jericho. “While the unemployment rate has risen this year, it is easier to find a job now than it has been for many years.

Swiss-born Frank, who died this week aged 94, had photographed what he saw with his keen outsider’s eye, capturing what Diane Arbus would later describe as “the hollowness” of many American lives.

124,cancer,"Obesity rivals smoking as cause of cancer, UK charity warns","Obesity is rivalling smoking as a cause of cancer, responsible for more cases of bowel, kidney, ovarian and liver cancer than cigarettes, according to the UK’s leading cancer charity. 
Smoking is still the biggest cause of cancer, but Cancer Research UK (CRUK) has warned that government action to tackle obesity is vital, because it is a significant factor in 13 different types of cancer. Obese people now outnumber smokers by two to one. 
Michelle Mitchell, the charity’s chief executive, said: “As smoking rates fall and obesity rates rise, we can clearly see the impact on a national health crisis when the government puts policies in place – and when it puts its head in the sand. 
“Our children could be a smoke-free generation, but we’ve hit a devastating record high for childhood obesity, and now we need urgent government intervention to end the epidemic. They still have a chance to save lives.” 
 
 Levels of smoking and obesity in the UK 
 
Excess weight causes about 1,900 more cases of bowel cancer than smoking in the UK each year, said CRUK. There are also 1,400 more cases of kidney cancer caused by excess weight than by smoking each year, 460 more ovarian cancers and 180 more cases of liver cancer. 
The charity issued its warning as figures were released by Public Health England and the Office for National Statistics showing the decline in smoking in the UK. There has been a big reduction in the overall smoking rate to 14.7% last year, down five percentage points from 2011. Across the UK, 26% of the adult population were classified as obese in 2016, while 40% of men and 30% of women were overweight. 
Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, said: “Although cancer survival is at a record high, this significant progress is in danger of being undone by the fast-growing epidemic of obesity, given excess weight is linked to 13 types of cancer. 
“This study is further proof that obesity is the new smoking, and the NHS can’t win the ‘battle against the bulge’ on its own; families, food businesses and government all need to play their part if we’re to avoid copying America’s damaging and costly example.” 
 
 Excess weight causes more cases of some types of cancer than smoking 
 
Caroline Cerny of the Obesity Health Alliance, a coalition of more than 40 health organisations, said: “The causes of obesity are complex, but we know that the environment we live in plays a huge role, and currently this is heavily skewed towards unhealthy options. This is why we need the government to push on with plans to bring in a 9pm watershed on junk food adverts on TV and online, reduce the amount of unhealthy food promoted in supermarkets, and take sugar out of everyday food and drinks.” 
 
  
  
   
    
    Eating too much sugar contributes to people having too many calories during the day, which can lead to weight gain. Being overweight increases the risk of health problems such as heart diseases, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Sugar is also one of the main causes of tooth decay.&nbsp;
    The NHS advises that most adults and children in the UK eat too much of a type of sugar called 'free sugars'. These are the sugars added to food and drinks, found in biscuits, chocolate, breakfast cereals and fizzy drinks. But they are also found naturally in honey and unsweetened fruit juices.
    The UK government’s recommendation is that these 'free sugars' should not make up more than 5% of the calories you have every day. That is still quite a lot of sugar - it equates to seven sugar cubes worth for an adult. But bear in mind that one can of a fizzy drink can include the equivalent of 9 cubes of sugar. Children under 4 should avoid all sugar-sweetened drinks and food with added 'free sugars' in it.
    Martin Belam
    
   
  
  
 
CRUK agrees with that agenda. “There isn’t a silver bullet to reduce obesity, but the huge fall in smoking over the years – partly thanks to advertising and environmental bans – shows that government-led change works. It was needed to tackle sky-high smoking rates, and now the same is true for obesity,” said Prof Linda Bauld, the charity’s prevention expert. 
The British Medical Association said the government was dragging its heels over bringing in measures to curb obesity. “The severity of this problem must not be underestimated. As well as the pressing need to raise public awareness of the worrying link between obesity and multiple types of cancer, we need to see a reversal of the cuts to public health funding so we can prevent children and adults reaching this critical stage. Failure to do so will continue to cost lives,” said the association’s board of science chair, Prof Parveen Kumar."
125,cancer,‘Being diagnosed with cancer forced me to rethink my finances’,"Name: Sarah MillsAge: 35Income: £300 a day, three days a weekOccupation: Freelance TV producer/writer A year ago I was diagnosed with stage three bowel cancer. I’d been passing blood so one day I called 111, who told me to immediately visit A&amp;E. A few tests showed I was anaemic. I was told more tests would be needed. Over the next few months I had to press for these tests as I knew something was wrong. Eventually a colonoscopy showed a malignant mass. They tell you in the room if you have a tumour, but I don’t think they’re allowed to confirm cancer, though it was heavily implied. My best friend was with me, and we went straight to the pub because we were in shock. It was frightening but I knew the NHS would give me the best care possible. I had surgery to remove the tumour and part of the rectum and colon, was given a colostomy, and then underwent chemotherapy for about four months. Not only did it impact my health, but financially it was a struggle, as apart from two small contracts, I couldn’t work for most of the year. Those contracts helped keep me afloat. I applied for employment and support allowance (ESA) as well as housing benefit for the rental part of my flat (which eventually rolled over into universal credit), which together came to about £700 a month and helped me pay my bills and make ends meet. Universal credit in itself was a really troubling process: the system is impenetrable. I wasn’t paid until five months after I first tried to apply. It was dreadful. During the treatment I moved back in with my parents in Kent. I would have fallen into debt if I hadn’t. When I was sick, a friend of mine recommended I speak to [cancer charity] Macmillan. They advised me not only what I should eat and drink, and what exercise I could do, but also financially, letting me know that I could contact my mortgage provider to reduce my payments, that my prescriptions were exempt, and that I could claim my travel to hospital. They also gave me a grant of £400, part of which I used to go to Center Parcs with my friends for a weekend. I returned to work earlier this year. I’ve found a part-time senior development producer contract role for three days a week, which pays me £300 a day. I still have a bit of fatigue, so I’m more limited in the sorts of roles I can look for. I live in a shared ownership flat in Dalston [in north-east London], which I bought two years ago. My mortgage is £450 a month, and rent £500. Service charge comes to £118. Other bills total about £300. I have a spare bedroom, and I sometimes rent it out to help alleviate the housing costs. I’ve just had someone staying Monday to Friday, for which I received £670 a month in rent. I’m currently looking for another part-time lodger. I spend about £50 a week on food shopping. I used to go out loads and probably spent £200 a week socialising, but now it’s more like £50 a week. Fortunately, I don’t have cancer at the moment, but I can’t say I’m all clear as I have to wait five years until after diagnosis. I still go for regular scans. The cancer has meant I’m definitely more tired than I used to be: I can’t really exercise any more. To keep myself sane during the long hours of chemo, I started a vlog and got a load of funny and famous people to keep me company. When I was ill, I regretted not having any savings. Now I plan to try to put away 20% of my earnings into a savings account. I know people say that when you have something like cancer, you should start living like there’s no tomorrow, but actually, it’s making me live like there is a tomorrow. It’s made me feel like I actually need to be more grown up and become more of an adult.

126,cancer,The Waiting Room - Living with cancer and a teenage son,"When Victoria Mapplebeck was diagnosed with breast cancer, she decided to record each step of her journey from diagnosis to recovery. Shot on an iPhone X, Victoria filmed her time in waiting rooms, surgery and chemotherapy. 
The Waiting Room is an unflinching portrait of the blood, sweat and tears of cancer treatment. Victoria makes visible the often invisible sickness, fatigue, tears and hair loss. At home, she filmed with her teenage son as they came to terms with how single-parent family life was transformed by a year of living with cancer. 
Victoria documents cancer from a patient’s point of view, exploring what we can and what we can’t control when our bodies fail us. “We have made cancer our enemy, a dark force to be fought by a relentlessly upbeat attitude,” she says. The Waiting Room is the antidote to what she perceives as the “tyranny of positive thinking. It challenges the cultural myths that surround the disease and puts the language of illness under the microscope. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
Victoria’s previous short documentary, Missed Call, also made using mobile phones, won a Bafta for best short-form programme in May. She is a writer, artist and director who has been experimenting with the frontiers of documentary and creative technology for the last two decades. 
She wrote and directed Smart Hearts, Channel 4’s first interactive documentary series in 1999, in which webcams streamed live from the subjects’ homes for over 18 months. She also wrote and directed TEXT ME in 2014, an award winning interactive arts project which created an evolving and living archive in which users are encouraged to collect, curate and share stories from their digital past. 
The Waiting Room is accompanied by a VR Project that delves even deeper into the experience of living with cancer.

127,cancer,NHS doctor moves into motorhome to protect three-year-old son,"An NHS intensive care doctor working on the frontline of the coronavirus crisis has moved into a motorhome to protect his three-year-old son who has cancer. Nick Dennison is an anaesthetist at Frimley Park hospital in Surrey, but is now working as an intensive care doctor to help put the most ill Covid-19 patients on ventilators. His son, Alfie, has recently started a three-year chemotherapy programme as he fights cancer, so Dennison made the difficult decision to move out of the family home so he can continue treating coronavirus patients without putting Alfie at risk. “I have had to make the difficult choice: to do my job and save lives of people I don’t know, or to be with my son whilst he battles cancer,” Dennison said in a Facebook post that has been shared more than 90,000 times. “This virus is a big threat to his life and, as I am going to be exposed this week doing my job, I can no longer live at home. “Later this week I’ll be moving into a motorhome and will not be able to take any further part in his care for the next 6 months.”Alfie celebrated his third birthday last week and is suffering from lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the immune system. “Alfie hopefully will survive his cancer and chemo, but many people will die from flu. My heart is broken making this decision, but I choose to save the lives of strangers and leave him in the care of my beautiful wife and family,” Dennison said. On Sunday, Frimley Park hospital reported the deaths of five patients who had tested positive for Covid-19 and Dennison said the intensive care unit was already full, with 12 patients on ventilators after contracting the virus. “My hospital usually has 4-10 patients on ventilators and is planning and EXPECTING 80 patients to require ventilation,” he added. He said two of his ICU colleagues at other hospitals are off work after contracting the infection and fears he could soon be in a similar situation. “As healthcare workers, we are now EXPECTING to catch it despite PPE.” His post finished with a plea to the public to socially distance themselves from others to stop the spread of the disease and ease the burden on the already stretched NHS. “Pubs have been busy, offices open, social events happening, kids parties etc. It all needs to stop,” he said. “Infected people shed virus and it must be everywhere by now. It is your social responsibility to engage in social distancing. Actions NOW can prevent further disease transmission, ICU admissions and deaths in 10-20 days. Bottom line. SOCIALLY ISOLATE or people die in two weeks.”"
128,cancer,NHS cancer scans left unread for weeks because of pension row,"Cancer scans showing the presence or spread of the disease are going unread for as long as six weeks as the impact of the doctors’ pension dispute on patient care worsens. Hospitals are increasingly having to reduce the services they can provide as thousands of consultants stop doing overtime in order to avoid being hit by unexpected tax bills of up to £80,000. “Radiology waiting times are unacceptable, with [delays of] five to six weeks for cancer patients on treatment to get a report,” said one consultant quoted in a new dossier of evidence collected by the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA). A consultant radiologist at another hospital said: “Scan report turnaround time has gone from one week to over a month. Unexpected and critical findings are going unreported for weeks. We are now just firefighting.” And a cancer specialist at a third hospital said: “There are cases where cancer has been missed as a result [of scans not being read for weeks].” Patients are turning up for appointments with their specialist but going straight home again because their scan has not been read, rendering the consultation pointless. The HCSA’s findings are based on reports from 1,116 consultants across the UK. They also reveal that one hospital can no longer treat patients at the weekend who suffer bleeding on the brain with a procedure known as coiling because doctors staffing the service have scaled back their hours as a result of the pension problem. Patients who turn up in A&amp;E in severe pain from the neurological condition trigeminal neuralgia are having to be admitted and given doses of strong painkillers because surgeons are not available to operate on them. “The breakdown of hospital services is gathering pace and threatens to run out of control by winter unless the Treasury admits it has got it wrong,” said Dr Claudia Paoloni, the HCSA’s president. “Across the UK we hear reports of clinics and surgery grinding to a halt due to staff shortages for which doctors cannot be blamed.” The pensions problem – which can see doctors in effect paying the NHS to work extra shifts – is also prompting growing numbers of consultants to quit the NHS to work abroad. At one NHS trust in England three of a 30-strong team of anaesthetists are leaving for Australia and New Zealand. In Sussex four senior registrars – who are soon due to become consultants – are taking up new jobs at that level in Canada and the Middle East. The HCSA’s dossier confirms the picture of widespread and growing cancellations of planned operations, especially sessions of “catch-up” surgery at weekends to help reduce ballooning waiting lists, that the Guardian reported on 8 July. A hospital in Essex has had to cancel cancer surgery because so many of its anaesthetists have stopped working extra hours so that they do not earn additional income that could then trigger a hefty pension tax bill. Some consultants have had to remortgage their houses to pay the amounts sought by the HMRC. Clinics and operating theatres in Liverpool that were previously running every weekend are “now at a standstill”, according to the HSCA, which has 3,500 doctors as members. “For years hospitals have papered over the cracks [of doctor shortages] by cajoling medical staff to work ever more overtime, partly because they know they can exploit doctors’ overriding desire to make people well. This now lies exposed by a tax system which means hospital doctors stepping up to cover gaps in patient care are left facing financial penalties running into tens of thousands of pounds for doing so,” said Paoloni. The government has tried to tackle the problem by letting consultants pay less into their pension for up to 10 years, in an effort to avoid reaching the £1.1m limit of their pension pot, in what is known as the “50/50” scheme. But the HCSA, British Medical Association and NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts in England, have all rejected that as inadequate. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) will examine other possible solutions. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has promised to fix the problem before the next tax year begins in April 2020. In a further sign of the worsening impact on NHS services, seven in 10 (71%) consultants said pension issues had directly affected patient care in their hospital. Half (51%) said the problem had forced them to stop doing overtime while 26% had cut the amount of extra work they did. A DHSC spokesperson said: “We will consult on proposals to make NHS pensions more flexible for senior clinicians, in response to evidence that shows this issue is having a direct impact on retention and frontline service delivery. We will carefully consider all views on our proposals.” "
129,cancer,Know the risks about HRT and breast cancer. But don’t panic about them,"It was hard to avoid the story, late last week: “Breast cancer risk from using HRT is twice what was thought,” it warned. I read it, because as someone who’s experienced breast cancer I’m always interested in the latest news about it. The new research doesn’t apply to me: I wasn’t taking HRT when I was diagnosed aged 51, and like most breast cancer survivors, HRT isn’t an option for me now. The latest news is about the risks being higher than previously believed, but researchers have long known there’s a link. In fact it would be remarkable if that wasn’t the case, since for so many women, me included, breast cancer is connected to hormones, which HRT is all about.    What my brush with breast cancer taught me above all was that it’s vitally important to be vigilant    So my main thought wasn’t really about HRT. Instead, it was about how terrified many women would be reading that headline. I remember so well that grip of fear; for many years, my life was blighted by it. Breast cancer seemed everywhere, and somewhere inside I suspected it was only going to be a matter of time before I got it myself. The weird thing is that the reality of having it turned out to be nothing like as terrifying as the fear that I’d get it. Of course, hearing I had cancer was an appalling blow initially. There were a few weeks when my life was entirely dominated by the need to get information – from a whole raft of tests and operations; about how serious it was; and what could be done about it. But once I and the specialist had all the information, and had worked out a treatment pathway that would both hopefully banish the disease and work for me, I realised things weren’t nearly as bad as I’d feared. The worst thing about getting cancer was the finding out, and the information-gathering – after that, there was a route to sorting it out. Sadly, of course I know that’s not how it is for every breast cancer patient. But for a majority of us, my experience is typical. Certainly when I was “in the system” I was very aware that I was surrounded by doctors and caregivers who were used to dealing with women like me for whom the disease would be a temporary problem, rather than a death sentence. More and more women, and again I was lucky enough to be one of these, are also able to deal with breast cancer without losing a breast or having major changes to their bodies. Oncoplastic surgery, which allows surgeons to remove the tumour and rearrange the breast tissue so you’re left virtually unscathed, is improving all the time, and I was very much a beneficiary of it. So too are tests that identify whether or not you need chemotherapy: again, I was one of the lucky ones.   Related: Breast cancer risk from using HRT is ‘twice what was thought’    What my brush with breast cancer taught me above all was that it’s vitally important to be vigilant, to report changes, to listen to your instincts (three doctors told me I didn’t have cancer, before it turned out that I did) and to seek out information if it’s confirmed you do have a tumour. But I wish I hadn’t spent so long living under a cloud of fear, because the reality wasn’t as bad as the anticipation. Panic, I learned, is the worst way to respond to cancer: it’s entirely understandable, but it doesn’t help in any way. The new research, when you read it all through calmly, shows that the risk of breast cancer if you’re taking HRT is up slightly; so you have a 6% chance of it anyway, between the ages of 50 and 69, and if you’re taking HRT, that rises to 8%. Now that’s important to know, but it’s equally important not to panic about. If you’re affected by the story, talk to a medic who knows their stuff on it – that’s well worth your time. You need to weigh up the risks based on your individual attitude to life in general, and to risk-taking in particular. After all, you’re a whole person, not just a potential breast cancer candidate: in my experience, you make the best choices for your health if you keep that very much to the front of your mind. • Joanna Moorhead writes for the Guardian"
130,cancer,Why we're tackling the Etape du Tour despite our breast cancer,"A breakaway is a cycling term that refers to an individual or a small group of cyclists who have successfully opened a gap ahead of the peloton, the main group of cyclists. On 21 July, two of us are plotting a breakaway from the disease that hangs over our daily lives by tackling one of the most challenging amateur cycling events. The Etape du Tour, which has been running since 1993, is a chance for amateur cyclists to test their mettle on a stage of the Tour de France, riding on the same routes and under the same conditions as the professionals. The 2019 edition will feature stage 20 of the race, Albertville to Val Thorens, covering a distance of 130km, with 4,450 metres of climbing. After three categorised climbs, participants will finish in Europe’s highest ski resort, which sits at 2,465 metres. It is a considerable challenge for any cyclist. There are 16,000 participants, of which only 7% are women. But we will face an even greater challenge in reaching the final summit: both of us have or have had breast cancer. Liz, 44, is a retired consultant breast surgeon and was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015. She suffered a local recurrence last year, and her subsequent treatment left her with disabling side-effects. She says cycling helps keep her sane, and she rode the Maratona dles Dolomites three weeks after her surgery last year. She completed the Maratona dles Dolomites again this July, but this will be her first Etape. I am a 46-year-old business consultant. I was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013. In February last year, a discovery of a brain tumour led to a diagnosis of incurable but treatable stage 4, or advanced, breast cancer. I am currently on a new form of targeted therapy, which, while easier to manage than chemotherapy, still causes considerable side-effects. I completed the Etape in July 2018, albeit very slowly, just six months after surgery to remove a brain tumour and radiotherapy. For me, cycling is my escape from cancer, an opportunity to gauge myself by something other than scan results or blood tests. The one thing I’m not when I’m on the bike is a cancer patient.     Christine O’Connell tackling the 2018 Etape du Tour. Photograph: Courtesy Christine O'Connell    The more I learned about secondary breast cancer, and the relative paucity of funding for research into a disease that killed nearly 12,000 women in the UK alone in 2016, the more I wanted to do something to help patients live longer and better lives. And if I could fit it with my passion for cycling, all the better. So I founded One More City, a cycling campaign to fund research into the condition at Imperial College London. We hold an annual cycling challenge, starting from where the previous year’s ride finished. This year, 32 cyclists will ride the 720km between Amsterdam and Strasbourg over four days. Liz and I are both strong advocates for exercise during and after cancer treatment, and hope that others burdened with similar diseases or challenges will be inspired by our examples. While guidance on exercise in the cancer context is improving, there is little information for patients who do not want to be deterred from participating in “rites of passage” amateur events such as the Etape du Tour. We were both keen on sport before our diagnoses, and although we have had to adapt our training and temper expectations, we are both determined not to let our medical conditions stop us from pursuing what we love. The formal evidence might not be there, but we believe that continuing to train helps us tolerate treatment, both physically and mentally, and may even improve clinical outcomes. I believe I am the fittest I’ve ever been on the bike. I manage my training regime carefully, and work with a cycling coach. Every sport cyclist has to build up their endurance and strength over time, but when you’re on a treatment regime that causes fatigue and joint pain, you have to be especially mindful of the strain you are putting on your body. Rest time is important, as well as off-bike training for flexibility and core strength. Partly because of the lack of guidance for athletes with cancer, Liz is currently setting up a charity called Cancer Fit. Its aim is to encourage every cancer patient to get moving, regardless of how active they were before their diagnosis, but with a particular focus on those who were very fit and want to stay that way. She had to trawl Twitter to find other athletes to inspire and motivate her when she continued to train during chemotherapy, and hopes this charity will encourage others to do the same. With the Etape just days away, I think back to crossing the finish line last year, tears in my eyes. I had signed up for the Etape before my secondary diagnosis and I wasn’t sure I would even get to the start line, let alone the finish. This year, I’ve had more time to learn to live with my incurable cancer, but the experience will be as meaningful, the challenge as acute and the emotions as raw. Cancer has taken so much from me, but this is my chance to leave it all behind – an opportunity to prove to myself that, for now, I can still do the things I love. And there’s something special about watching the pros a few days later as they seemingly float up the same climbs that nearly destroyed you. As three-time Tour winner Greg LeMond famously said, “It never gets any easier – you just get faster.” • If you’re an athlete with cancer or a researcher looking into exercise and cancer, you can contact Liz and Christine directly for more information."
131,cancer,Cancer charity fears for boys and men who miss out on HPV vaccination,"A “missing generation” of more than a million boys and young men will miss out on vaccinations that could protect them against several forms of cancer, a charity is warning. The Teenage Cancer Trust wants boys aged 13 to 24 to be offered the HPV (human papillomavirus) jab, now that it is to be routine for them to get it at the age of 12, alongside girls. “While it’s great some boys from this year onwards will have the same protection against HPV-related cancers that teenage girls and women have had for a decade, a generation of teenage boys and young men are being denied that chance,” said the trust’s chief executive, Kate Collins. “Parents of school-age boys may well find one child will get the HPV vaccine for free, whereas an older son will only be protected if they can afford to pay for it. That simply isn’t fair, and the cost of around £150 per dose is unaffordable for many.   Related: Cervical cancer could be eliminated in most countries by 2100 – research    “Not vaccinating older teenage boys puts them at risk as it relies on the false presumption they will only have sexual partners who don’t have HPV. It undermines the UK’s progress on reducing HPV-linked cancers, such as cervical cancer, as this ‘missing generation’ of boys can get and share HPV with others who’ve not been vaccinated. And it contradicts the NHS’s own message that universal vaccinations are for the common good.” The HPV vaccine protects girls against the virus that is the main cause of cervical cancer. It has reduced the main circulating strains of HPV by 80% since the programme began in 2008. Immunising boys will help reduce the presence of the sexually transmitted virus in circulation still further. However, immunising boys will have direct benefits for them as well. HPV also causes about 90% of anal cancers and 50% of penile cancers, and some cancers of the head and neck, as well as about 90% of genital warts.  The HPV school vaccination programme will be open to boys in years 8 to 12 for the first time from September. When the programme began for girls a decade ago, the vaccine was also offered to older girls and young women. The Teenage Cancer Trust says that should happen for boys and young men now. The charity’s own survey shows that 76% of teenage boys and young men aged 13 to 24 would want the vaccine if they were offered it for free on the NHS. If they had to pay, however, nearly half (46%) would not get it."
132,cancer,War metaphors in cancer conversations,"The language and imagery used by those talking about cancer can, as Simon Jenkins suggests (When it comes to cancer spare us the war metaphors, Opinion, 29 January), cause great distress to and put pressure on patients and their families. My husband died of a brain tumour. Some time later, a friend of his was diagnosed with a very treatable cancer. During his treatment he told me of his belief that being relentlessly positive was vital to his recovery. This was no doubt useful to his mental state, and I was delighted when he was successfully cured. However, later, he commented to me that he still couldn’t understand why my husband had died, given that he too “had always been so positive”. I answered pointedly that unlike his friend he had not been lucky enough to develop a cancer that was currently curable and left it at that, but at the time, and even now, years later, I find the implication that if he’d only managed to be a bit more cheerful he’d have come through both ill-informed and deeply distressing.Jill WallisAston Clinton, Buckinghamshire • As someone who has recently lost a daughter to this vile epidemic, I should advise Mr Jenkins that these war metaphors are appropriate when it comes to care and support from the drastically underfunded NHS. It is a “battle” to get reasonable, fair and speedy treatment and patients are “at war” with a service that is struggling to cope. Until people become aware of the true extent of this plague and demand more, immediate, funding to “fight” it, the “war” (which is being lost) will continue.Robert DaviesWarninglid, West Sussex • These metaphors were parodied in the US satirical magazine the Onion in 1999, which published a brilliant article about a cowardly man who refused to fight cancer.Michael CunninghamWolverhampton • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

133,cancer,"Sugar in fruit juice may raise risk of cancer, study finds","Drinking large amounts of fruit juice may raise your risk of cancer, according to a big study which has found a link between the regular consumption of all kinds of sugary drinks and the likelihood of developing the disease. 
The study, carried out in France, is the first substantial piece of research to find a specific association between sugar and cancer. Sugary drinks such as colas, lemonade and energy drinks have been linked to obesity, which is a cause of cancer, but the French researchers suggest there could also be other reasons sugar could trigger it. 
The study, published in the BMJ, finds the association with cancer is just as strong with fruit juices as it is with colas. “When the group of sugary drinks was split into 100% fruit juices and other sugary drinks, the consumption of both beverage types was associated with a higher risk of overall cancer,” it says. 
Cutting down on the amount of sugary drinks we all consume, together with sugar taxes and restrictions on marketing, might help reduce the cancer burden, say the authors. That does not mean nobody should ever drink them. “As usual with nutrition, the idea is not to avoid foods, just to balance the intake,” said Dr Mathilde Touvier, who led the research, from Inserm, the French national institute of health and medical research. 
“The recommendation from several public health agencies is to consume less than one drink per day. If you consume from time to time a sugary drink it won’t be a problem, but if you drink at least one glass a day it can raise the risk of several diseases – here, maybe cancer, but also with a high level of evidence, cardiometabolic diseases.” 
Fruit juices showed the same association with cancer as colas. “The main driver of the association seems to be sugar, so when we just look at the sugar content per 100ml, regular Coke or 100% orange juice, for instance, are quite the same. So it’s not so odd that we observe this association for fruit juices,” said Touvier. 
But public health agencies say that fruit juices are a little bit better because they contain some vitamins and a little bit of fibre, she added. 
The study is observational, so it is not possible for the researchers to state that sugar is a cause of cancer. The authors call for that to be investigated further. They say there are plausible biological mechanisms, such as the effect of sugar on the visceral fat stored around vital organs such as the liver and pancreas, blood sugar levels and inflammatory markers, all of which are linked to increased cancer risk. 
 
  
  
   
    
    Eating too much sugar contributes to people having too many calories during the day, which can lead to weight gain. Being overweight increases the risk of health problems such as heart diseases, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Sugar is also one of the main causes of tooth decay.&nbsp;
    The NHS advises that most adults and children in the UK eat too much of a type of sugar called 'free sugars'. These are the sugars added to food and drinks, found in biscuits, chocolate, breakfast cereals and fizzy drinks. But they are also found naturally in honey and unsweetened fruit juices.
    The UK government’s recommendation is that these 'free sugars' should not make up more than 5% of the calories you have every day. That is still quite a lot of sugar - it equates to seven sugar cubes worth for an adult. But bear in mind that one can of a fizzy drink can include the equivalent of 9 cubes of sugar. Children under 4 should avoid all sugar-sweetened drinks and food with added 'free sugars' in it.
    Martin Belam
    
   
  
  
 
The data was collected through a long-running nutrition survey in France, called NutriNet-Santé, involving 101,257 healthy French adults, 79% of whom were women. 
Those taking part had completed at least two 24-hour online validated dietary questionnaires, designed to measure their usual intake of 3,300 food and beverage items, and were followed up for a maximum of nine years. Over that time, nearly 2,200 cases of cancer were diagnosed, including 693 breast cancers. They found that a 100ml increase in sugary drink consumption was associated with an 18% increased risk of overall cancer and a 22% increased risk of breast cancer. 
There was no link between artificial sweeteners and cancer, but the numbers using artificial sweeteners were too small to be conclusive. 
“Clearly there is more work to be done and measuring dietary intake is challenging – however, the message from the totality of evidence on excess sugar consumption and various health outcomes is clear – reducing the amount of sugar in our diet is extremely important. This highlights why our UK sugar levy and controls on the marketing of high-sugar products is so important, not only in terms of obesity but also possibly cancer prevention,” said Dr Amelia Lake, reader in public health nutrition at Teesside University. 
Dr Graham Wheeler, a senior statistician at University College London’s cancer trials centre, said the study was large, well designed and added to the evidence of risk. But, he said, “whilst there was some evidence for an association between sugary drink consumption and the risk of developing breast cancer, the same association was not found for colorectal or prostate cancers. Further research into the biological mechanism between sugary drink consumption and specific cancers is needed to establish if one does indeed cause the other.”

134,cancer,BBC broadcaster Simon Warr dies aged 65,"The BBC broadcaster and former teacher Simon Warr has died from cancer aged 65 after announcing days ago he was in a hospice with a “very serious health condition”. On Thursday, he tweeted that he was unlikely to return to social media, while thanking his friends and followers for their support. Warr, who lived in west London, regularly appeared on BBC Radio Suffolk and was the headmaster on Channel 4’s reality documentary That’ll Teach ’Em, in which students experienced life in a traditional English grammar school over a summer. He also taught foreign languages at secondary school and was wrongly accused of historical child abuse in 2012 before being cleared of all charges in 2014. He expressed a hope that his legacy, as described in his book Presumed Guilty, would be raising “awareness of the human costs” of false allegations and wrongful convictions after his campaigning. “It is a comfort to know that my book Presumed Guilty has been useful for so many who have faced this ordeal and for their families,” he tweeted, adding that a close friend would make public the outcome of his health condition. A post on his Twitter account said on Saturday morning: “It is with great sadness that I’ve been asked to let all Simon’s followers know that he passed away early this morning at the age of 65 after a short battle with pancreatic/liver cancer. He was surrounded by his family, as well as the love and prayers of his many friends. “Simon’s family have asked me to thank everyone who sent him such kind messages of love, support and hope. Simon’s campaign for justice for the falsely accused will continue. He had just finished writing a new book. Funeral arrangements will be shared soon.” Fellow broadcaster Jeremy Vine tweeted that he was “very sad” to learn of Warr’s passing. “Simon Warr brought huge energy to every appearance he made [on] BBC Radio 2 and Jeremy Vine on 5, and there were many. He had an incredible zest and a passion for learning and debate.” He also praised his presenting style. “He was a tremendously loyal and very kind man whose abrasive on-air style belied his true thoughtfulness and compassion,” he said. “He loved to broadcast, to write, and above all to teach. Taken too soon, and far too quickly. RIP”"
135,cancer,'A pioneer and provocateur': performance artist Ulay dies aged 76,"The performance artist Ulay has died in Ljubljana, Slovenia, aged 76. He had been suffering from lymphatic cancer. Born Frank Uwe Laysiepen in Germany, Ulay and his then-partner, the Serbian performance artist Marina Abramović, became renowned for 14 “relation works”. Conceived over a decade in which the pair lived together in a Citroën van most, if not all, the works involved feats of danger and endurance with the purported aim of annihilating each of their egos and becoming a single artistic entity.              In Light/Dark from 1977, Ulay and Abramović knelt opposite one another and slapped each other across the face with increasing ferocity. Three years later, the work Rest Energy saw Ulay point a drawn bow and arrow at Abramović’s heart – a slight movement of one finger could have killed her. In a series of performances called Nightsea Crossing, the pair sat in chairs opposite each other for seven hours a day. The Lovers, Ulay and Abramović’s final work together, commemorated the end of their relationship. Starting in April 1988, each started walking from opposite ends of the Great Wall of China, Ulay in the Gobi desert and Abramović by the Yellow Sea. After walking more than 1,500 miles each, they met in the middle and, without speaking, bade each other farewell. The performance caused amazement. “Every time I came to a village, the entire village would come and look at me,” Abramović told the Art Newspaper.           Ulay and Abramović in Light/Dark    Ulay first found fame as an artist after moving to Amsterdam and becoming a photographer for Polaroid. Experimenting with the film and cameras the company gave him, his Polaroids from the early 70s explore his own identity, depicting him cross-dressed or self-mutilated. After splitting from Abramović he returned to the Polaroid, in the early 90s experimenting with a giant camera that produced “Polagram” images taller than the artist himself. In 2010, he surprised Abramović by taking a seat opposite her during her durational performance piece The Artist Is Present at MoMA in New York. The pair had not spoken for decades, but clasped hands and cried. The following year Ulay was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer. Two years later the documentary, Project Cancer: Ulay’s Journal from November to November, charted his treatment, life and work. After chemotherapy, Ulay went into remission but continued to smoke.           Ulay took a seat opposite Abramović during her performance piece The Artist Is Present at MoMA in New York.     He sued Abramović in 2015, claiming that she had withheld money owed to him and not fully credited his part in their artworks, resulting in the Serbian artist being ordered to pay him €250,000 (£215,000) plus costs. In the aftermath, however, the two became friendly again, participating in a 2017 film, The Story of Marina Abramović and Ulay, which charted the course of their relationship. “Everything naughty, nasty disagreements or whatever from the past, we dropped,” Ulay said in the film. “It’s a beautiful story, actually.” Ulay’s gallery, Richard Saltoun, confirmed Ulay’s death with the statement: “Ulay was the freest of spirits – a pioneer and provocateur with a radically and historically unique oeuvre, operating at the intersection of photography and the conceptually oriented approaches of performance and body art. His passing leaves a momentous gap in the world – one that will not be so easily replaced.”"
136,cancer,Are genetic tests useful to predict cancer?,"The health secretary, Matt Hancock, this week shared his shock at discovering that he is at greater than average risk for prostate cancer, despite having no family history of the disease. 
The revelation came after he took a predictive genetic test that assesses risk for 16 common diseases, including coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, asthma and breast and prostate cancers. 
Hancock said the test might have “saved his life” and that such tests should be urgently rolled out on the NHS, to guide screening programs and the age at which drugs like statins are prescribed. However the suggestion was immediately met with controversy. Some claim that the usefulness of predictive DNA tests has been overstated, pointing to the fact that, while Hancock described his own 15% lifetime risk of prostate cancer as “high”, it was only marginally above the population average risk of 12%. So are predictive genetic tests going to revolutionise prevention and treatment of common diseases or should we be sceptical?

Until now, genetic testing for disease risk has largely focused on versions of single gene that confer a substantial amount of risk, such as BRCA for breast cancer. 
The latest predictive tests for a range of common diseases take a different approach: they aggregate the tiny contributions to risk made by hundreds or even thousands of genes to give a personalised score. Because the risk is spread out over many genes, people can end up at the very high-risk end of the spectrum by chance, without having a family history of a particular illness. 
 
  
  
   
    
    Our genes are made of deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA, which forms double helix strands inside the nuclei of our bodies’&nbsp;cells.
    DNA contains information that is passed from generation to generation and directs the development of our bodies.
    Scientists began studying ancient DNA 20 years ago when Svante Pääbo used gene amplification techniques to extract and analyse genetic material from Neanderthals.
    At first only fragments of Neanderthal DNA could be studied, but by developing techniques to piece together small overlapping fragments, it was possible to recreate the entire set of genes, or genome, of a Neanderthal.
    Subsequent research showed that most people outside Africa contain small numbers of Neanderthal genes, the result of interbreeding between the two species as modern humans emerged from their African homeland about 70,000 years ago.
    In 2010 scientists discovered the genome of a completely new human species in bone and tooth fragments found in the Denisova cave, Siberia. These people are now known as Denisovans.
    Research published last year suggests that modern humans&nbsp;interbred with both Neanderthals and Denisovans&nbsp;on numerous occasions over the past 250,000 years.
    
   
  
  
 
Genomics Plc, the Oxford-based data science company that provided the health secretary with personalised risk scores, has just released results showing the extent to which predictive DNA tests can reveal the likelihood of diseases from cancers to asthma and coronary heart disease. 
Based on data from 160,000 men (UK Biobank participants), it found that those who scored in the top 1% in terms of risk for heart disease had the same risk at 45 years old as an average man at 60-65 and one of the lowest risk men in their mid-70s. 
When the scientists looked more closely at common characteristics of the high-risk men, they found they had slightly higher cholesterol, BMI and blood pressure – but not extraordinarily high. 
Prof Peter Donnelly, a statistical geneticist and CEO of Genomics Plc, said: “Many of them are individuals who would be invisible to the health system currently. They’re happily wandering around the streets at much higher risk of heart disease but not aware of it. If you were one of these men that’s potentially helpful to know.” 
Similarly for breast cancer, the top 1% of women – based on genetic risk score – had a 30% lifetime risk of breast cancer, while the lowest 5% had a 2%-3% lifetime risk. Genomics said its tests cost £20-£40 per person, much lower than the £500-£1,000 cost to sequence a whole genome. 
“The world we’re in, where we screen women just based on age and offer mammography at 50, just doesn’t make sense,” said Donnelly. “We should be screening these women much earlier.” 
Prof John Bell, a professor of medicine at Oxford university who led a recent government-commissioned review of the life sciences industry, said the approach could have a “quite profound” effect on the ability to manage disease. 
 
  Related: Could we soon be able to detect cancer in 10 minutes?  
 
Currently, he said, screening programmes face huge problems: they are expensive, they give lots of false positives and miss people such as women in their early forties who never enter routine screening for breast cancer, but who have a high genetic risk. “It’s all slightly hopeless,” he said. “This is exactly what we need.” 
David Spiegelhalter, professor for the public understanding of risk at the University of Cambridge, agrees that genetic tests could allow the NHS to rapidly identify those who may need closer monitoring. However, he said care would need to be taken in how risk scores were communicated to individual patients, most of whom (as in the case of Matt Hancock) fall somewhere in the mid-range for most illnesses. 
“Even the most extreme 3% are only at around 2-3 times average risk, and so most people will only be given a moderately raised or lowered risk,” said Spiegelhalter. “It is essential that these results are communicated properly, to avoid any suggestion that they are predicting the future.” 
A significant concern is that the vast majority of data that has been used to identify risk genes has come from people of white European heritage, who are significantly overrepresented in genetics studies and databases such as UK Biobank. The extent to which genes confer risk also depends on the overall genetic backdrop, which varies across ethnicities. This means that currently the tests developed by companies such as Genomics Plc work less well for people of non-white European heritage. 
Donnelly said the company is currently assessing the extent of the performance gap and looking for ways to improve the technology so it works better for everyone. “One has to even think really hard about whether it should be rolled out now when it’s more useful for some individuals than others,” he said, adding that if there was a significant gap then he would be against rolling it out quickly.

137,cancer,MRI scans to be trialled as test for prostate cancer,"Hundreds of men will be given MRI scans in a groundbreaking clinical trial that scientists say could transform screening for prostate cancer. The £5m trial, which begins in August, is pioneering a simple, 10-minute scan that scientists hope could provide the first reliable method for identifying dangerous tumours in the general population. It follows a change in guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) last month, which made MRI scans the first line test for diagnosis of the disease. Unlike blood tests, the latest generation of scans appear to be effective at distinguishing between cancers that are likely to grow and spread and benign tumours that are safe to leave untreated. “I think that could revolutionise the way that we diagnose disease and hopefully identify men who would be better treated than not treated,” Prof Mark Emberton, the dean of medical sciences at University College London told Cheltenham Science Festival. Since prostate cancer grows slowly, it is possible that men with a negative scan at 55 or 60 years might effectively be given the all-clear for many years to come – or even for life. “If your prostate comes back looking very clean … you’re probably very unlikely to develop prostate cancer,” said Emberton. “It may be once we learn a bit more about it that you need to refresh it every 10 years or something like that.” Currently, screening for prostate cancer is not recommended in the UK because the available tests are too unreliable. For instance, raised levels of the protein PSA in the blood are linked to prostate cancer, but about 75% of men with high levels turn out to not have aggressive cancer that needs treatment and about 15% of men with cancer have normal levels of PSA. “You end up with a lot of men being diagnosed with cancer that isn’t destined to kill them,” said Emberton. “What’s beautiful about MRI is it overlooks the many, many cancers which don’t need to be diagnosed.” The failure to detect prostate cancer early makes it difficult to treat and 11,000 men die from the disease in the UK each year. The latest trial, funded by the Medical Research Council and Cancer Research UK, will invite 1,000 men aged 55 to 75 for scans through two London GP surgeries.  The target is to scan 450, but how willing men will be to take up the offer is an open question. “We think they will,” said Emberton. “One of the reasons people didn’t before is because they were worried about the examination. You know, finger in the bottom. They were worried about the biopsy needle in the prostate. This involves neither.” The 10-minute scan, which it is estimated will cost about £150, is a simplified version of the 30-minute scan used to diagnose cancer in men who are at risk. The scientists are assessing the prevalence of prostate tumours in the population. It is anticipated that more than 90% of men should get a clean bill of health, with others being either referred for treatment or monitored over time. Karen Stalbow, the head of policy, knowledge and impact at Prostate Cancer UK, said the trial could provide an exciting step towards a national screening programme. “If the results are positive, then MRI scanning could offer a non-invasive first stage of prostate cancer diagnosis in the future,” she said. However, others cautioned that the reliability of MRI had not yet been established in the wider population. Prof Ros Eeles, professor of prostate cancer genetics at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said: “The use of MRI of the prostate will be important in general management of prostate cancer assessment. However, currently it is not at all clear that MRI will be reliable to detect all cancers. “In men at higher genetic risk, there are studies being undertaken at the Institute of Cancer Research to assess if men who have a genetic predisposition to aggressive prostate cancer have changes on their MRI when they get prostate cancer. At present, it is not at all certain that it will be reliable to rely on MRI alone for this assessment.”"
138,cancer,Former Republican senator Tom Coburn dies aged 72,"The former Republican senator Tom Coburn has died at 72, according to a newspaper in his native Oklahoma.   Related: US coronavirus live: Trump attacks 'lamestream media' as number of cases passes 100,000    The Oklahoman published a statement from the senator’s family and said he died after “a long fight with prostate cancer”. Coburn, the paper said, ""served in the Senate from 2005 to 2015 and in the US House of Representatives from 1995 to 2001. After leaving the Senate, he pushed for a constitutional convention and advocated for a range of conservative fiscal causes.” Mike Pence, the vice-president, wrote on Twitter: “Tom Coburn was a great conservative voice in the United States Congress and American physician whose legacy will live on. Karen and I send our deepest sympathies and prayers to his family during this tough time.” Coburn was a doctor who resigned his Senate seat following his cancer diagnosis. “This decision isn’t about my health, my prognosis or even my hopes and desires,” he said then. “As a citizen, I am now convinced that I can best serve my own children and grandchildren by shifting my focus elsewhere.” One such effort was in support of rightwing efforts to call a Constitutional Convention, in an attempt to dramatically restrict the powers of the US federal government. “We’re in a battle for the future of our country,” Coburn told the annual convention of the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec) in New Orleans in August 2018. “We’re either going to become a socialist, Marxist country like western Europe, or we’re going to be free.

139,cancer,My life in sex: ‘My desire for an erection became greater than my fear of needles’,"We gave ourselves the unaccustomed luxury of several hours of afternoon lovemaking, knowing this might be our last time. This knowledge intensified our closeness and matched the excitement of our first encounters nearly 30 years earlier. The next day, I underwent a radical prostatectomy to treat an aggressive cancer. The procedure removed my prostate; I would no longer have spontaneous erections and my orgasms would be “dry”. Following the operation, the effect was dramatic; my penis was totally unresponsive. Charities offered useful guidance about how a cancer diagnosis affects a relationship, but were largely silent about sex. So much attention had been given to treating the cancer that I felt frighteningly ignorant about what would be involved in regaining some function; I didn’t even know whether it is possible to have an orgasm without an erection. After failed experiments with a vacuum pump, my desire for an erection became greater than my fear of needles, so I decided to try self-injecting with a prescribed treatment. It required training; my first experience was in front of a doctor who explained the process. We had several practice runs at home to find the right dose.

140,cancer,"Residents of US Cancer Town diagnosed at 'highly unusual' rates, study says","Residents in the town of Reserve, Louisiana have been diagnosed with cancer at “highly unusual” rates, according to a new academic study, which is set to further embolden local residents in their fight against toxic emissions from a nearby chemical factory. The report, released Wednesday by the University Network for Human Rights (UNHR), provides residents with the most detailed and comprehensive evidence to date that they are at an especially pronounced risk of cancer and other negative health effects due to toxic chemicals in the air.   series embed   Reserve is the focus of a year-long Guardian series, Cancer Town, chronicling the fight for clean air in the predominantly black town, as well as other communities in the area between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, often referred to as Cancer Alley due to a concentration of toxic pollution from petrochemical factories. The toxic emissions in Reserve, a town in St John the Baptist parish, primarily come from the Pontchartrain Works facility, the only place in America to manufacture the synthetic rubber neoprene. The US government considers chloroprene, the primary constituent of neoprene, as likely to be carcinogenic to humans. Researchers found that 10.5% of survey respondents in the area immediately surrounding the plant had experienced a cancer diagnosis – even when they removed households with frequent cigarette smokers from the analysis – a rate they describe as “extremely improbable”. The report determined that a typical US population made up of the same race, sex and age composition as the one surveyed would experience an average diagnosis rate of 7%, and the likelihood of it being as high as it is simply by chance is a minuscule 0.37%. “The findings are disturbing, and they highlight that there is need for much more study of the health status of people living in Cancer Alley,” said lead researcher Ruhan Nagra. Researchers also separated their findings into two zones, a circle including those homes closest to the plant, and an outer ring of households farther away. Those in the zone closest to the plant experienced an even higher rate – 12.4%. “It supports the local people’s suspicions that this plant was at the root cause of the poisoning of our community,” said Robert Taylor, a local resident who has been organizing to fight emissions levels since 2014. “The closer you are to the plant, the sicker you are.”     Norco, Louisana. Communities in the area between New Orleans and Baton Rouge are often referred to as Cancer Alley due to a concentration of toxic pollution from petrochemical factories. Photograph: Julie Dermansky/The Guardian    The plant’s operator, a US subsidiary of the Japanese chemical company Denka, as well as the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ), have consistently argued the community in Reserve are in no immediate danger due to emissions from the Pontchartrain Works emissions. Denka Performance Elastomers (DPE) spokesman Jim Harris told the Guardian that the company could not comment on the specifics of the report because they were not provided a copy in advance of its publication, but cast doubt on its reliability. “From what we have learned, the study appears to be based on individual interviews rather than scientific analysis of actual cancer incidences,” Harris said. “Fortunately, there is a neutral state body that does compile and analyze information on cancer incidence, and has for many years – the Louisiana Tumor Registry. The Tumor Registry’s scientific analysis has for years shown that there is no historical or current increase in cancers thought to be associated with chloroprene in the census tracts bordering the facility. In fact, rates near the facility are even significantly lower in some cases.” The registry, in its most recent report, stated that the term Cancer Alley “has no scientific validity”. Nagra called their reports “notoriously incomplete”, adding that the registry itself “admits that they don’t collect the type of data needed to determine the existence of associations between industry and cancer”. A representative from the registry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The UNHR study relied instead on responses to a door-to-door health impacts survey of more than 500 households within a 2.5km radius of the plant conducted in March 2018. The analysis compared the real-world survey findings against a computer simulation of a population with the same race, sex and age demographics. “For every resident in our survey sample, we had a corresponding resident – of the same race, sex and age – in our simulated population,” researchers said. The simulated resident was then assigned as either having been diagnosed with cancer or not, based on data from the National Cancer Institute. Researchers ran the simulation 10,000 times to generate a distribution of possible outcomes for a community with similar demographics. The methods were developed by epidemiology and statistics experts at Stanford University and, according to Nagra, were done conservatively, largely because they were “aware of the pushback from industry against these types of studies”. Beyond cancer, the report also offered residents their most conclusive look yet at the prevalence of the other symptoms associated with chloroprene exposure, which include: chest pains, heart palpitations, rapid heartbeat, wheezing, difficulty breathing and rashes on the skin. Since there is no national-level data on how often people experience most of these symptoms, researchers compared the results of residents closest to the plant with those from people who lived farther away. In every single case, there were significantly more symptoms reported in the closer zone.   The cancer rate is nearly double the expected rate within a 1.5km radius of the Pontchartrain Works facility   For residents like Lydia Gerrard, who has long dealt with skin irritation and rashes, the research represents confirmation of what she had long suspected about her decades of exposure to chloroprene while living in Reserve. Gerrard’s husband died from kidney cancer in 2018, and sitting for an interview with the researchers for this study was one of the last things he did before he passed. “I’m more than sure – that’s where it probably came from,” he told researchers, speaking about the connection between his cancer and the plant, “because that’s one of the cancers that’s been associated with chloroprene.” Before the full release of the report, Nagra, along with Taylor and Gerrard, traveled to Tokyo, Japan, to present their findings to DPE’s parent company. Nagra said the company responded with “utter defiance” and declined to take a meeting with their envoy. DPE has made efforts to bring down emissions levels in recent years, having recently hit a targeted 85% reduction, thanks almost entirely to the installation of new emission control technology. The amount of chloroprene in the air still regularly exceeds the 0.2 μg/m3 that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says is acceptable, however. Nagra sees this report as all the more reason why the company ought to be held rigidly to that standard. “Eighty-five percent of what it was in 2014 – that’s just not good enough,” Nagra said. “Emissions have got to come down to the EPA guidelines. So this is not a radical position. It’s just it’s self-evident.” The Guardian, in collaboration with the Poor People’s Campaign, will be hosting a series of events on the Cancer Town series in New Orleans and Reserve on 26 and 27 July."
141,cancer,First baby is born through new egg-freezing technique,"A woman who was left infertile by cancer treatment has given birth to a baby after her immature eggs were collected, matured in a lab and frozen for use five years later. Fertility specialists at Antoine Béclère University hospital in Clamart near Paris said the healthy boy, named Jules, was the first baby to be born through the new procedure. “We didn’t know whether or not the frozen eggs would survive and keep their potential to produce a pregnancy and live birth,” said Michaël Grynberg, the head of reproductive medicine and fertility preservation at the hospital. “It was a good surprise for us.” The unnamed woman was offered fertility counselling when she was about to embark on a course of chemotherapy for breast cancer at the age of 29. The drugs used in many cancer treatments are known to put fertility at risk.   Related: UK time limit on storing frozen eggs and sperm could be extended    Doctors ruled out the standard IVF procedure of using hormones to stimulate the woman’s ovaries to produce eggs, concerned it might exacerbate her cancer. Another option was to remove and freeze some of the patient’s ovarian tissue and reimplant it when she had recovered, but the woman considered the operation too invasive. Instead, the woman opted for retrieval of early-stage eggs from her ovaries. These were matured in the lab for one or two days and then vitrified – a process that freezes the cells rapidly in nitrogen to reduce the chances of ice crystals forming and rupturing them. The woman recovered from cancer but found she could not get pregnant naturally and returned to the hospital for fertility treatment. There, Grynberg’s team thawed seven frozen eggs, six of which survived the process. These were fertilised with sperm injections, but only one developed into a healthy embryo that gave rise to the successful pregnancy. The boy was born on 6 July 2019 when the woman was 34. Grynberg said that while the procedure was not particularly efficient, it allowed some women to have babies when they had exhausted other options. In cancer patients, removing and freezing ovarian tissue before chemotherapy can be a more reliable approach, but in addition to being an invasive operation, the procedure has long-term risks if cancer cells have infiltrated the ovarian tissue that is removed for storage before chemotherapy.  Details of the birth were published in Annals of Oncology. “She was very lucky and we were as well,” Grynberg added. Two more women, one who was treated for breast cancer and another who was treated for lymphoma, were now pregnant after having the same procedure at the hospital, he said. The medical team is working to make the procedure more efficient. At the moment, many embryos created from eggs that have been matured in the lab and then frozen do not develop well enough to establish healthy pregnancies. Grynberg said the team hoped to improve the culture medium used to mature the eggs in the lab. Another issue the doctors want to understand better is why the number of immature eggs they can retrieve from women varies so dramatically. “We can have two different patients, both aged 30, and get 10 eggs from one woman, and 20 from the other, and we don’t know why,” Grynberg said. Eggs have been matured in the lab before and used to create embryos that have gone on to produce live births. But this was the first birth from an egg matured in the lab and then frozen before use."
142,cancer,Residents of America’s Cancer Town confront chemical plant owner in Japan,"Residents of Reserve, Louisiana, have travelled to Tokyo to confront the executives and shareholders of a Japanese company which runs a chemical plant they say is responsible for a spike in cancers and a litany of other diseases in their home town – the town at the highest risk of cancer due to airborne toxicity anywhere in the US, according to the Environment Protection Agency (EPA). Their trip involved a series of public and private meetings with environmental groups and stakeholders in the chemicals giant Denka, which operates the Pontchartrain Works facility in Reserve. It marks a significant escalation in the residents’ campaign for clean air.   CT series box   Reserve is the focus of a yearlong Guardian series, Cancer Town, examining the fight for clean air in the town, as well as other communities in the area between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, known colloquially as Cancer Alley. The Pontchartrain Works facility, was opened in 1968 by the chemicals giant DuPont and sold to Japanese firm Denka in 2015. It is the only site in the US to produce the synthetic rubber neoprene, which is made of the compound chloroprene, listed by the federal government as a likely carcinogen. In 2015, the EPA found emissions from the plant placed residents at the highest risk of cancer due to airborne toxicity anywhere in the US. The plant came online in 1968, the year Robert Taylor, one of the residents on the trip to Japan, built a house for his young family. The plant is situated in the middle of the St John the Baptist parish, a predominantly black, working-class community, like many of the other sites of petrochemical plants along the nearby stretch of the Mississippi, pointed out Taylor.  “We’re still segregated; it’s just a continuation of the American way of life,” said Taylor at a public event at the Pacific Asia Resource Centre in Tokyo. Last week, Taylor and Lydia Gerrard, a fellow resident whose husband, Walter, died a year ago of cancer, attempted to make their case directly to Denka at its annual shareholders meeting in central Tokyo. They were refused entry after an “extended confrontation with Denka people”, but held a protest outside, said Ruhan Nagra of the University Network for Human Rights (UNHR), a US-based civil society group that organised the trip. “We had a huge banner saying ‘Denka, Stop Poisoning Black People’ in English and Japanese, and handed out flyers,” said Nagra.     7/10 On June 21, Robert Taylor and Lydia Gerard spoke at press conference at Japan’s Environment Ministry. Watch as Lydia Gerard talks about her husband Walter, who died of kidney cancer almost exactly one year ago after inhaling chloroprene his whole life: #DenkaChloropreneKills pic.twitter.com/KTzpwvIevn&mdash; University Network for Human Rights (@unitedforrights) June 23, 2019    For decades local residents were unaware of the specific chloroprene risk, though they long suspected the rise in health problems was related to emissions from the plant, Taylor told the public meeting in Tokyo on Monday. “We began to go down with strange diseases, cancers, respiratory problems, skin conditions, heart problems. These diseases were so prevalent my daughter, who worked as a nurse and used to look after us when we got sick, developed gastroparesis,” said Taylor, referring to a stomach disorder. “The doctors said it was a rare immune system condition which was caused by the pollution from the plant, but they wouldn’t go on record. Three other women in the community developed the same condition.” Chemicals giant DuPont operated the plant for nearly half a century, before selling it to a Japanese counterpart Denka just before an EPA report designated it as the principle cause of the highest risk for cancer of any factory in the US, at 50 times the national average. Earlier in the month the Louisiana state government announced its intention to sue both Denka and DuPont over alleged Clean Air Act violations at the plant, a significant and rare move in a state known for lax environmental enforcement. The UNHR had tried to contact Denka in advance of their trip, but was told the company was not responsible for the actions of its US subsidiary. Despite this claim, Denka issued a statement on its website the day before the shareholder meeting defending its subsidiary’s operations and stating, “the carcinogenic risk level assigned to chloroprene … is overestimated”. “Denka is disputing the findings of the EPA and any scientist who says that chloroprene causes cancer,” said Gerrard, who believes the long trip has been worthwhile in spite of Denka’s refusal to meet with them. “We wanted them to hear us, to know that we’re not going to go away and be quiet.” The protest was covered by Kyodo, Japan’s biggest news agency, and subsequently picked up by a number of regional newspapers, but not by any national Japanese media. Nagra hopes that will change next month, when UNHR releases the results of a study conducted last year on the health of 500 households near the Denka facility. The report shows that health problems increase with proximity to the plant and that cancer rates are far higher than statistically normal. The delegation did manage to meet this week with two of Denka’s institutional shareholders in Tokyo on condition the identity of their companies was not disclosed. The UNHR is now planning to contact European and US shareholders and explain the dangers to those living near the plant."
143,cancer,Parents of girl who died of infection at Glasgow hospital demand inquiry,"The parents of Milly Main, the 10-year-old girl who died after contracting an infection in Glasgow’s crisis-hit children’s hospital, have called for a fatal accident inquiry into her death. The girl died in August 2017 after contracting an infection while she was recovering from leukaemia treatment on a cancer ward at the Royal Hospital for Children that was later closed because of concerns about water contamination. Last November whistleblowers revealed that hospital management had been warned of a high risk of infection only three weeks before she died. Anas Sarwar, Labour MSP for Glasgow, who has been supporting the Main family, told Holyrood infection control doctors alerted management to concerns about line infections, escalating this to Health Protection Scotland and the Scottish government, and requested testing of the water. Milly had been making a good recovery from cancer treatment when her Hickman line, a catheter used to administer drugs, became infected. A month after her death, an assessment of the water supply again found a high risk of infections. Speaking to reporters at the Scottish parliament on Thursday afternoon, Milly’s mother, Kimberly Darroch, described the trickle of revelations about her daughter’s death as “soul-destroying”. “It has been incredibly painful for us to relive Milly’s death, with bits of information slowly being fed to us thanks only to the work of brave NHS whistleblowers, Anas Sarwar and the media. “We believe Milly would still be alive today if the managers had listened to all the warnings of infection risk when the QEUH first opened. We have lost all faith in the health board and its leadership.” Darroch and Milly’s father, Neil Main, said they had instructed solicitors and a letter had been sent to the lord advocate, arguing that “the circumstances of Milly’s death gives rise to many questions of significant concern as to how she came to be infected while being treated at a children’s cancer ward”. The letter acts as a referral of the death to the procurator fiscal. It was not reported by the health board at the time. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Scotland’s largest health board, was placed in the Scottish equivalent of special measures in November by the health secretary, Jeane Freeman, who announced a public inquiry into hospital building flaws in September when concerns about the children’s wards were first raised. Asked about the case at first minister’s questions on Thursday, Nicola Sturgeon said she sympathised with the family and hoped that the Lord Advocate would respond as quickly as possible. Darroch said Sturgeon’s remarks were “encouraging”, while Anas Sarwar said Freeman “has to be given the chance to do the right thing.” He added: “If this had happened in the private sector there would be a criminal investigation, which is why there now needs to be a fatal accident inquiry. This is the very least the family deserves”."
144,cancer,"Cancer and chemicals in Reserve, Louisiana: the science explained","St John the Baptist parish sits about 20 miles from New Orleans in southern Louisiana. Home to about 45,000 people, this predominantly black parish contains the US neighborhoods most at risk of cancer due to air toxicity, according to government science. The parish sits at the heart of a region sometimes described as “Cancer Alley” because of the pollution from a high concentration of petrochemical plants. Throughout the year, the Guardian will be reporting from St John and other places nearby. Here’s a rundown of the common questions on the science behind the health hazards in this corner of Louisiana. What’s in the air in St John the Baptist parish? There are nearly 50 toxic chemicals in the air here, including known carcinogens like benzene, 1,3 butadiene and formaldehyde. But according America’s environmental regulatory agency, the EPA, the two most pressing concerns for residents in St John the Baptist are chloroprene and ethylene oxide [EtO]. The chloroprene comes from the Pontchartrain Works facility, which straddles the towns of LaPlace and Reserve in St John the Baptist. The plant was built by chemicals company DuPont and sold to the Japanese firm Denka in 2015. According to EPA data, the facility presents the greatest risk of cancer from air pollution of any factory in the US.   Embed linker   In the area closest to the factory, residents face a cancer risk of 50 times the national average – primarily due to chloroprene, but also EtO, which is emitted by several nearby facilities. The agency has been monitoring chloroprene levels in St John since 2016. According to the EPA, the safest limit for chloroprene is 0.2 micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m3). But readings throughout Reserve and LaPlace far exceed this on a regular basis.  What is chloroprene and where does it come from? Chloroprene is the primary ingredient in the production of neoprene, a synthetic rubber developed by the DuPont company in 1931. Neoprene is used in a wide variety of products from electrical insulation, belts, and gaskets, to consumer athletic and aquatic products, like wetsuits. From 1948 t0 2008, DuPont produced the majority of its neoprene at a facility in Louisville, Kentucky. But DuPont shuttered the facility in 2008 after concerns over toxic pollution pushed the city to adopt a “toxic air reduction” Program.    In the area closest to the factory, residents face a cancer risk of 50 times the national average    When that plant closed, DuPont’s facility in St John the Baptist became the sole producer of chloroprene and neoprene in the US. In 2015, the plant was sold to the Japanese company Denka Performance Elastomers. DuPont still owns the land beneath the plant, and other facilities on the site. What is ethylene oxide (EtO) and where does it come from? Ethylene oxide emissions are much more common than chloroprene in the US. The chemical is produced by nine different companies at 15 different facilities in the US, mostly in Texas and Louisiana. EtO is used in the production of many plastics, household cleaners, adhesives, and detergents. It is also sometimes used directly for the sterilization of medical equipment. In 2016, the Union Carbide facility in Hahnville, Louisiana was the No 2 emitter of EtO in the US. It sits just across the river from Reserve. How serious a cancer risk does chloroprene present, and how do we know? It’s substantial. The National Toxicology Program has described chloroprene as “reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen” based on the observation of tumor formation at multiple sites in animal studies. Quantifying those risks in humans, however, is complex, because it involves calculating the impact of exposure to relatively small amounts of the chemical over long periods of time. Currently, the most comprehensive research comes from an EPA program called the Integrated Risk Information System, or Iris. Iris uses a peer-reviewed method that pulls together the best studies that exist on an individual chemical, and converts them into a numerical estimation of the risks of exposure over a lifespan. According to the “weight of the evidence” reviewed by Iris chloroprene is “likely to be carcinogenic to humans”. What about EtO and cancer? Ethylene oxide is characterized as “carcinogenic to humans” by the EPA, based on evidence of lymphomas and breast cancer in workers exposed to EtO, along with tumors discovered in laboratory tests on animals. EtO was subject to the same peer-reviewed Iris process as chloroprene in 2016. Are there risks from these chemicals besides cancer? Aside from cancer, studies have found that chloroprene exposure can cause irritation to the skin, lungs and eyes; chest pains, rapid and irregular heartbeat, dizziness, insomnia, headache, and fatigue; and changes in the nervous and cardiovascular systems. Ethylene oxide exposure has been linked to eye and upper respiratory tract irritation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, malaise, fatigue, muscle weakness, and signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Other effects noted in some studies include dry mouth, sore throat, runny nose, shortness of breath, apnea, memory loss, and seizures. What do the manufacturers say? In a statement to the Guardian, Denka said that the health and safety of residents and employees were “the company’s top priorities” and said it operates the facility in Saint John the Baptist within all state permits.  But the company has repeatedly criticised the EPA’s 0.2 μg/m3 guidance. Denka instead touts the conclusions of a toxicological assessment it commissioned itself, which found that the safe amount of chloroprene in the air should be 156 times greater than what the EPA has determined.  But Denka doesn’t have many options besides to dispute the science. Company officials acknowledged that the EPA’s safe air quality levels are “technologically impossible to achieve,” and that the current Iris calculations “threaten the very survival of [Denka’s] neoprene production facility,” in a 2017 letter to the EPA. Denka also highlights the fact that it entered a voluntary agreement with the state of Louisiana to reduce emissions in 2016 after EPA data was first revealed demonstrating the risks from chloroprene. “Despite disagreement with the report’s suggestions … DPE voluntarily designed and committed to a plan to significantly reduce its emissions beyond the emissions control technology already in place at the plant … at a total cost of over $35m,” Denka spokeperson Jim Harris said. The industry response to the EPA’s evaluation of ethylene oxide has been similar. The American Chemical Council, a powerful lobbying group for the chemical industry, calls the EPA’s risk value for EtO “significantly flawed” due to “selective science”."
145,cancer,The men who leave their spouses when they have a life-threatening illness,"When Christie Sanchez was 12, she had the best stepdad in the world. He was charismatic and intelligent. He introduced her to new music and took her hiking every weekend. Then, her mom got sick. For two years Sanchez’s mom, Sandra, battled stage four breast cancer. It was advanced enough that within days of her diagnosis she was having her breasts, lymph nodes and both ovaries removed. Sanchez’s stepdad, Tom, was upbeat at first. He attended appointments with his wife, cooked meals and looked after the children. But within a week Sandra – the breadwinner in the family – was back at work, and within two, she was already cooking and cleaning again. By the six-month mark, her stepdad’s attitude had completely changed. “It’s like, once the chemotherapy started and he saw the decline in her health he was kind of like, ‘Oh shit,’ and tapped out.” Christie shared her experience of the ordeal on a thread that went viral on Twitter in February. The tweet that sparked it all off read: “My sister had stage four cancer and her ex husband complained about her not doing her part to clean up. I will never forget that for as long as I live.” The post, which has now been shared more than 300,000 times, set off a wave of responses underneath. “My mom had stage four cancer and my dad and brother let her clean everyday till she died ! :),” read one. “My mom was in the hospice and her husband was out and about in a new sports car picking up single moms at my sibling’s after school sports programs. Absolute garbage,” read another.   Related: How to check yourself for breast cancer    If you are hoping that these are rare horror stories, there is some comfort to be had: most people – regardless of gender – do not leave their partners when they get sick. In a 2015 paper, researchers tracked 2,701 marriages using a study on health and retirement and watched what happened when someone became unwell during a marriage: only 6% of cases ended in divorce. But that same study showed that when partners leave, it’s normally men. One study from 2009 found the strongest predictor for separation or divorce for patients with brain cancer was whether or not the sick person was a woman. That same study showed that men were seven times more likely to leave their partner than the other way around if one of them got brain cancer. In Christie’s case, this meant watching her stepdad go from being an energetic, loving guy, to an irresponsible, stroppy teenager. He would go into his room and sit on the computer as soon as his wife got in, leaving her to cook and clean while going through chemotherapy. “She would be saying to us, ‘I really need your help to do this.’ We tried to step up in the best way that we could, but we were just kids,” says Christie. Christie, her brother, and her mom made the unspoken decision there and then that they would power through without him until the cancer was gone. “It’s almost like grief. I expected him to be something but when it came down to it he just didn’t show up. He let [us all] down,” says Christie. ••• Gendered expectations about household work ought to have changed in the last few decades. Women have almost equal representation in the workplace and in 41% of US homes, women are the breadwinners. More men than ever are stay-at-home fathers. And yet, when a woman falls ill, it can really reveal the extent to which men not only feel entitled to a certain level of housework, but also have no concept of how to be an efficient and appropriate caregiver.Mieke Thomeer, a sociologist from the University of Alabama, who studies how gender affects couples when a partner gets sick, says in most couples people understand they will need to support their partner if they get sick. But, she says, men and women interpret what caregiving looks like very differently. Men tend to view their partner getting sick in almost a mechanical way: they see it as a problem to be solved. They can separate out the obvious and immediate physical tasks that result from the illness, but other caregiving requirements are left unconsidered, such as emotional care, or housework. This means that a lot of the time, women continue to do that work – and when they don’t, problems can arise. In 2018, researchers in Germany used a nationally representative sample to show that – as long as they are still able to – women continue to do an uneven amount of the housework while they are sick if that was the dynamic in the relationship before they became unwell. “Particularly with more mild conditions, the expectation is that the status quo will go on unless it gets so extreme that the wife really can’t do that work,” says Thomeer. The flip side of this is that relationships tend to function well when the woman gets sick and requires intensive care from her partner. But in cases where caregiving is not necessitated, men tend to downplay a woman’s symptoms and class her as largely self-sufficient, expecting her to ask for help rather than proactively giving it. When Dana Hurd returned after a preventive double mastectomy, her partner seemed to think that she should do anything she was able to – without considering whether it was a good idea, or whether it would be better to just help her.   Related: Can you find love after cancer? Lauren Mahon on loss, lust and first dates    In the months following the surgery, she had tissue expanders in her chest that were rock hard – they felt like Coke cans. “Every time I had to put on a sweater, or zip up a coat it was just excruciating pain,” she says. But she was still able to walk. And so, in the middle of an icy winter, her partner began to expect that she would walk their 45lb dog every day, just five weeks after surgery: “Never mind that I could have died if the dog pulled me over on to my front,” says Hurd. In many cases, women willingly do such work. Studies on women with breast cancer show that they tend to feel guilt for burdening their caregivers, and overcompensate. They set boundaries around what help they are willing to accept and continue to do what housework they can, while also giving emotional support to their caregiver. But the problem with this division of labor is that it is impractical in the long term: “The reality is that the condition will continue to deteriorate so that attitude is just not going to cut it,” says Thomeer. Instead, men need to take it upon themselves to learn how to do such chores when their partner gets sick, and women need to learn to give up some of that control. Otherwise, as the sick partner is less able to provide what she used to – that is when her husband may begin to get cold feet. Hurd’s partner’s gripe came when she stopped wanting to have sex. He started to have tantrums that she wasn’t showing him enough affection after her mastectomy. He began to accuse her of cheating on him; berated her for neglecting his needs; even cut her off his health insurance at one point – arguing that she was “treating him like a housemate”. Hurd started taking painkillers and having sex with him which she says made her feel like a blow-up doll, but she didn’t feel she had another choice. “If the spouse is used to [her doing these things], that might lead them to say ‘this isn’t really what I wanted,’ and to leave the marriage,” says Thomeer. ••• For Meredith Zapa, that point came five weeks after her mother was hospitalized for a serious heart condition. Her long-term boyfriend Andy dumped her while she was hooked up to tubes in the intensive care unit (both names have been changed). “He said he was too young to be dealing with someone who was so sick. He was 50,” Meredith tells me on the phone. When he dumped her mum by text, Meredith had to deliver the news. She recalls reading the text with surprise – not least because Andy had been sick just a few weeks earlier with kidney stones, and Meredith watched as her mother doted on him – constantly at his bedside, bringing him food and checking in with his doctors. When Meredith’s mother got sick, however, Andy asked Meredith to deal with the doctors. Despite the fact that he was listed as the primary caregiver, she said it didn’t occur to him that was actually his role: “He made it seem that it wasn’t his place to do that,” says Meredith. What became increasingly clear to Meredith was the gendered expectations men and women are willing to accept when it comes to caregiving. “My mother would never even call my brother to ask him to do anything – she didn’t want to bother him, would say that he is not good at this stuff – and yet we are both adults,” she says. These “family myths” – that women are better at certain roles, for example; or that men are incapable of the tasks required to do them well (“he can’t see dirt!”) – are often used to justify the unequal division of labor within a relationship, and so the unequal distribution of work continues. But, as Thomeer points out, there is a glaring problem: “People say, ‘We do what works for our family it just happens to be unequal’ – and yet, it just so happens to be unequal in very similar ways across all families.”  For Meredith’s mother, caregiving was women’s work – that much she said explicitly. Andy’s mother similarly indulged him, agreeing that he was too young to take on a caregiving role. “Our research consistently shows us that this work is much less appreciated when women do it - it is seen as what women do, what they have always done, even if it’s a little more heightened [when someone is sick],” says Thomeer. Men, on the other hand, are more appreciated for caregiving, and are more easily let off the hook when they decide it’s too much. Their family members notice the work that they are doing and chip in. To say that men benefit hugely from female caregiving is borne out by research. Men tend to suffer a lot more from widowhood, partly because they gain more support from marriage than women do. When his partner dies, he is more likely to actively seek out another relationship, whereas women are more likely to avoid marriage. Why? “Because they know it will entail more caregiving,” says Thomeer.  Women are so socialized into believing that they must be caregivers that it often doesn’t even occur to them that they can take time off, let alone that they might have another option. In one study with heterosexual, gay and lesbian couples, one woman gives care to her wife around the clock, taking time off to cry while on the subway. By contrast, one of the husbands participating in the study continues to ask his wife to attempt each and every task she can while she is going blind. Can we continue to blame these men, if they know no better? Isn’t it hard for them, too? “Sure, it’s hard – but just like how having a baby is hard,” says Meredith, adding: “[People] think women have some superior ability to do this stuff, but we don’t, we just do it.” Referring back to the text that Andy sent, she tears up. “She gave so much and he left so easily,” she says. Meredith’s mother finally came out of hospital last month, but they still haven’t heard from him. If he was reading this, what would Meredith say to him? “I just want [men] to provide the same amount of love and care to others that they provide to themselves,” she says."

Bolton warns of ‘unrelenting force’ if Iran attacks US or allies 
The US national security adviser, John Bolton, has raised Middle East tensions by announcing that an aircraft carrier and a bomber task force are being sent to the region in response to “escalatory indications and warnings” from Iran. It is unclear exactly what “indications” Bolton was referring to in his statement on Sunday, and the Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group’s voyage to the Gulf was previously planned. But Bolton said the military escalation was meant as a message to Tehran “that any attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force”.

147,cancer,Daryl Davis: the black musician who converts Ku Klux Klan members,"Daryl Davis is a musician – a pianist to be exact. He has jammed with the likes of Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, BB King and even Bill Clinton. Loyal to music but not to genre, he plays jazz, blues, rock’n’roll, country, boogie-woogie, swing, big band and beyond. No matter the musical style, Davis will play it, because he believes that music in all its variations is a great equalizer. So when he entered the Silver Dollar Lounge in Frederick, Maryland, for a country gig one fateful night in 1983, being the only black man present did not perturb him at all. While this was not his first country gig at the Silver Dollar Lounge, it was his most significant. After he and his band finished their set, Davis was approached by a patron who was around 15 years his senior. Not an unusual occurrence for a working musician. However, while praising Davis on his performance, the patron candidly noted that he had never seen a black man who could play like Jerry Lee Lewis.   Related: 'Make techno black again': a social experiment subverts whitewashing in clubs    More curious than offended, Davis used this encounter as an opportunity for friendly discourse rather than outrage. “I explained to this older white guy that Jerry Lee Lewis was influenced by the same black boogie-woogie and blues piano players as I was,” Davis says with a chuckle. “He didn’t believe me. Then I told him that Jerry Lewis is a good friend of mine and well, he didn’t believe that either, but he was fascinated.” “So he asks me to join him for a drink,” he continues. “I don’t drink so I had a glass of cranberry juice and then he took his glass and cheered me. Then he said, ‘You know, this is the first time I ever sat down and had a drink with a black person.’ I was instantly curious and thought, ‘What’s going on here?’ So I asked him why. He didn’t answer at first but eventually admitted that he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.” This is a story Davis shares on lecture stages and in classrooms – both nationally and globally. It is an important anecdote as it marks a catalytic moment in which Davis’s trajectory pivoted from working musician to race relations crusader. What began as a hobby gradually transformed into a calling. As his music career continued to flourish, Davis also became enmeshed in quite arguably the world’s strangest side hustle – meeting with KKK members of various ranks and attending so-called cross lighting rallies. Some of these Klansmen became close friends of Davis’s – the aforementioned Silver Dollar patron included – their long conversations untangling a knot of hate that had coiled for decades. In many cases, these civil dialogues led them to quitting the organization because they no longer believed in its tenets.     Daryl Davis and a KKK member. Photograph: Courtesy of Daryl Davis    While some say Davis converted these men, he prefers to say that they converted themselves, and that he merely provided the impetus for them to do so. Over the past 30 years, Davis has become well-versed in the organization’s ethos and hierarchy which led to him to becoming the first black man to write a book about the KKK entitled Klan-destine Relationships: A Black Man’s Odyssey in the Ku Klux Klan, which was published in 1998. The Ku Klux Klan was formed in 1865 by a group of Confederate soldiers at the end of the American civil war in an attempt to keep newly emancipated slaves suppressed. Having seen several iterations, what remains consistent across all chapters of the group is its hate toward people of color, sometimes resulting in assault and murder. In 2018, 153 years later, a record high of more than 1,000 hate groups – including the KKK – were documented as active in the United States by the Southern Poverty Law Center civil rights group. “Our ideology needs to catch up to our technology,” Davis said recently as a guest on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. So why would a successful musician like Davis willingly meet with high-ranking KKK members in his spare time? The journey to that answer begins long before his Silver Dollar Klan encounter in 1983. “In 1968, when I was the age of 10, I had a racist incident,” Davis recalls with conviction, his voice sonorous and unwavering. “I was in the Cub Scouts and we were in a parade when people started throwing rocks and things at me. I didn’t understand why people would do that and I formed a question: ‘How can you hate me when you don’t even know me?’” “The answer was always, ‘there’s some people who are just like that,’” Davis adds. “Well, that wasn’t good enough for me. What does ‘just like that’ mean? Where does that come from? You’re not born ‘just like that. I was curious about racism ever since, but even still, nobody can seem to answer the question.”              One of Davis’s first and most fabled encounters was with Grand Dragon Robert Kelly, who eventually became the Imperial Wizard of Maryland. After having his secretary set up a meeting with Kelly under the pretense of including him in a book about the KKK, Davis knew he was entering new territory. Kelly was unaware that Davis was black, so the grand reveal was a shock. After a few tense hours of conversation, the two parted ways, but their relationship did not end there. Eventually, Kelly began inviting Davis to his home and then to Klan rallies in which ritualistic chants were intoned, giant crosses were burned, and beer and hot dogs were served. Kelly shared everything with him, including the deeply racial stereotypes that help form the foundation of the Klan’s hatred. All the while, Davis listened, asked questions, took notes, and through his actions, slowly dispelled each stereotype one by one. With each conversation, the gap between them narrowed and they were able to become friends. Finally, Kelly quit the Klan, shut down his entire chapter and, as a trophy of sorts, gave his robe to Davis. That was not the last Ku Klux Klan robe that Davis would be gifted nor was it the last Klansman he would befriend. “I still perform sometimes and though I would much rather be on stage playing happy music all the time and seeing people dance than be talking about the KKK and neo-Nazis,” Davis says with a laugh, “I have found that lecturing and talking and educating people is far more important and necessary today.” Davis has lived through several eras of hate – from the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr in 1968 to the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. Though he has convinced hundreds of white supremacists to deradicalize and join the land of the loving, he does not deny that some are beyond saving. However, that acknowledgment does not deter his mission as he continues to focus on those who are open to conversation, open to civil discourse, open to friendship, and ultimately, open to change. Most recently, Davis partnered with Minds.com, an open source social networking platform that uses blockchain to reward the community with ERC20 tokens. Davis hopes to utilize this platform, founded by Bill Ottman and John Ottman, to educate people on how to conduct civil discourse. Beyond the world of white supremacy, the idea is to help individuals navigate through opposing perspectives – be it at a political protest, in a classroom, on social media, or at the dinner table. “People must stop focusing on the symptoms of hate, that’s like putting a Band-Aid on cancer,” Davis says. “We’ve got to treat it down to the bone, which is ignorance. The cure for ignorance is education. You fix the ignorance, there’s nothing to fear. If there’s nothing to fear, there’s nothing to hate. If there’s nothing to hate, there’s nothing or no one to destroy.”"
148,cancer,Labour’s Chris Bryant reveals skin cancer treatment,"The Labour MP Chris Bryant has revealed he was recently treated for stage three skin cancer. Speaking of his experience in a tearful interview with Kay Burley on Sky News, the member for Rhondda showed the camera a heart-shaped, blackened scar on the back of his head where he had undergone a skin graft after the removal of a melanoma. “I felt cold in my skin for 48 hours,” he said of the time immediately following his diagnosis early this year. “I slept terribly that night and I imagined everything – I was going to be dead by the end of the week, I wasn’t going to make it to Easter.” His husband, Jared, only spotted the “tiny little mole” after Bryant had his hair cut shorter than usual for a holiday at the end of last year. “We didn’t really think anything about it,” Bryant said, but in January he decided to have it checked by a GP just in case, and urged other people to do the same. The GP referred him to a dermatologist, who said frankly what she thought the growth was. “My heart sort of sank at that moment, because I know melanomas are a pretty nasty form of skin cancer. But I was very hopeful because the vast majority of them are at the early stages,” he said. He had the mole removed at Prince Charles hospital in Merthyr Tydfil five days later. “I had a plaster on the back of my head so everybody in parliament was saying: ‘Gosh, what’s that Chris?’ It was very obvious when we were going through the division lobbies and so on. Everybody could see it,” he said. “I’d told all my mates in parliament because I was so blase it was all going to be fine.” When he returned to the dermatologist’s office soon after, he said the test result came as a shock. “She was very simple and straightforward and she said: ‘You have a stage 3B melanoma.’ There are four stages of melanoma. I’m not a medical expert and I knew three was not good.” He continued: “It feels like being punched in the stomach and I know I’m nobody special. Hundreds and hundreds of people go through this all the time. You know, there’ll be people having this exactly today.” Bryant said he had been moved by how colleagues in parliament rallied around him. “I know people think politics at the moment is really nasty, but Tory MPs, Lib Dem MPs, Nationalists have been absolutely gorgeous with me.” He added that he wouldn’t stand for any criticism of the Welsh NHS after his treatment – after which he has a good prognosis. “I tell you now if the prime minister ever says a nasty word about the National Health Service in Wales again,” he said, “I will projectile vomit at her across the chamber.”"
149,cancer,"Night shifts do not increase breast cancer risk, study concludes","Night shift work does not increase the risk of breast cancer, finds a UK study covering analysis of 102,869 women over 10 years.  The Breast Cancer Now Generations study is the latest to examine the supposed link presented by experts for decades. In 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded that shift work disrupting the body’s sleep-wake cycle was “probably carcinogenic”. However, the agency is due to review its findings this summer.  Breast Cancer Now claims the latest research, which it funded, is the most comprehensive to date. Michael Jones, a co-author of the study and staff scientist in genetics and epidemiology at the Institute of Cancer Research, in London, said: “A possible link between exposure to electric light at night and an increased risk of breast cancer was first proposed more than 30 years ago, but research has so far been inconclusive. “In our new study we found no overall link between women having done night shift work in the last 10 years and their risk of breast cancer, regardless of the different types of work they did involving night shifts, and the age at which they started such work.” Breast cancer is the UK’s most common cancer, with about 55,000 women and 350 men being diagnosed each year. Previous research conclusions have differed on the impact of shift work.  In 2009, in response to the 2007 IARC research, Denmark began compensating dozens of women with the disease who said their illness had been brought on by working night shifts.   Related: I’ve had breast cancer. But I know some screening can do more harm than good | Fay Schopen    But the study published on Wednesday, in the British Journal of Cancer, builds on the conclusions of a 2016 meta-analysis which suggested there was little or no association. That study had been challenged due to the older average age of participants and because it had limited details on the nature of women’s shift work. The median age of participants at the age of recruitment in the latest study was 45 years, and 17.5% of participants reported being night shift workers regularly working between 10pm and 7am within the previous 10 years. The shift data was followed up six years later. The researchers observed that 2,059 out of 102,869 women went on to develop invasive breast cancer. Taking into account confounding risk factors, the researchers found no overall association with night shift work. They also found no significant difference in risk relating to the type of night shift work, the age at which the work was started, or whether it began before or after a first pregnancy. The only statistically significant trend was found specifically with average night hours worked per week, but researchers said it was not supported by previous evidence or any proposed biological explanation. Delyth Morgan, chief executive at Breast Cancer Care and Breast Cancer Now, which funded the study, said: “We hope these findings will help reassure the hundreds of thousands of women working night shifts that it’s unlikely their job patterns are increasing their risk of breast cancer.” Jones stressed that night shifts could still have other adverse effects on health."
150,cancer,NHS bosses accused of breaking law in cancer scanning privatisation,"NHS bosses stand accused of endangering patients, “flagrant” lawbreaking and intimidating a leading hospital trust over their controversial privatisation of cancer scanning services. Oxfordshire councillors have warned that cancer patients in Thames Valley will receive a poorer service because NHS England has decided to take a contract for PET-CT scanning away from Oxford university hospitals (OUH) trust and hand it to the private firm InHealth. They have heavily criticised NHS England’s behaviour and judgment over the contract in an unusually strong letter to the health secretary, Matt Hancock. He now has to decide whether to back NHS England’s decision, which has sparked an outcry from MPs, patients and doctors, or risk legal action from InHealth by ordering a rerun of the tendering process. A cross-party group of MPs from Oxfordshire has also ramped up the pressure on Hancock in a separate letter which voices their fears that letting the private firm take over the service will mean cancer care is weakened, because PET-CT scanning is integral to treating patients. Councillors on Oxfordshire county council’s joint health overview and scrutiny committee (HOSC) raised a series of serious concerns in a withering letter they sent to Hancock on 7 May invoking their legal powers to refer the matter to him for a final decision. In it they claim that patients will receive an inferior service in future because InHealth staff will not attend multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meetings of NHS staff, which play a key role in ensuring someone gets the best treatment. “Whilst this [MDT meeting] can happen remotely, the committee was not convinced of this alternative approach and feels strongly that deviation from the existing ‘one-team’ approach would lead to a poorer outcome for patients,” says the letter, which the Guardian has seen. The councillors, who are mainly Conservatives, also claim that performing PET-CT scans on suspected cancer patients in mobile units InHealth plans to set up in Swindon and Milton Keynes will give less accurate results than those from fixed scanners in hospitals such as the Churchill in Oxford. That could produce a “two-tier service” in which patients scanned in Swindon and Milton Keynes “while benefiting from easier access, could have a poorer outcome given the combination of machines that are calibrated differently, potentially producing less accurate results, a lack of doctors on site to deal with any health problems that may arise, and radiologists only communicating remotely with clinicians”. But the councillors reserve their strongest criticisms for NHS England’s alleged failure to fulfil its legal duty to consult the HOSC soon after it decided to put the PET-CT service in the Thames Valley out to tender. It accuses the organisation of presenting it with a fait accompli by not letting the HOSC analyse the bids and offer its view, which constituted “flagrant disregard” for the obligation, under the Health and Social Care Act 2001, to consult the council. “The committee believes that as a result of the approach NHSE has taken, having already arrived at a decision and showing such arrogant disregard for discharging statutory duties and engaging in due process, all local steps to try and resolve this matter have been exhausted,” the councillors say. The councillors also castigate NHS England for threatening to sue OUH for raising its concerns that InHealth becoming the provider would risk patient safety, which the Guardian revealed last month. “The committee has been made aware that this is not the only incidence and that there may be a wider pattern of intimidation. The stifling of legitimate discussion by appropriate bodies about the nature of the proposal runs against the normal approach to consultation,” they state. Local MPs endorsed the HOSC’s concerns. Victoria Prentis, the Tory MP for Banbury, who co-ordinated the letter from local Tory, Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs, said: “You can’t have a health service that says it’s open and transparent and then not do that. I’m confused why NHS England didn’t consult the HOSC. Why didn’t they speak to them? That’s extraordinary.” Anneliese Dodds, the Labour MP for Oxford East, which includes the Churchill hospital, said: “This excoriating letter sums up the many problems with NHS England’s decision to award Oxford’s cancer scanning services to a private company, and then backtrack and try to create a ‘partnership’ between that company and the NHS, after it was faced with massive local and national opposition.” Cancer specialists at OUH had been “sidelined” by NHS England, she added. An NHS England spokesperson said: “This letter contains a number of obvious and major factual errors. But the NHS won’t let that prevent partnership working to expand PET-CT services for patients not only in Oxford but also for the first time by opening new and far more convenient services for patients in Swindon and Milton Keynes.” NHS England denies threatening to sue OUH for libel, even though its lawyers’ letter to the trust – which the Guardian has seen – raises that possibility."

152,cancer,Broadest ever therapeutic HPV vaccine to be tested in clinical trial,"The broadest vaccine yet that could clear up persistent HPV infections and reduce the risk of women developing cervical cancer is to be tested in a clinical trial.  Human papillomavirus infections are common and are generally cleared by the body. However, about 10% of infections are not cleared, with persistent infections of certain types of HPV known to increase the risk of a number of cancers, including cervical cancer. Now experts say they are about to conduct a trial of the broadest vaccine yet that could clear up persistent HPV infections.  Dr Karin Hellner a consultant gynaecologist at Oxford University and lead investigator for the trial, said: “In a big picture world we would test for infection with high-risk HPV to identify the women with a persistent high-risk HPV infection… [and] we would give the therapeutic vaccine [so] this woman would never develop any pre-cancerous changes or cervical cancer.” In the UK, girls and boys aged 12 to 13 are offered two doses of a vaccine that protects against infection with four types of HPV, including two linked to cancers and two that are known to cause genital warts. Catch-up vaccinations are offered up to the age of 25, with men who have sex with men offered the vaccine if they are 45 or younger. But while the preventive approach is proving successful, the vaccine does not protect against all high-risk types of HPV and cannot clear up existing infections, while millions of men and women have missed out on the vaccine because of their age.   Related: HPV vaccine 'offers chance' of wiping out cervical cancer in rich countries    The new trial, which is planned to begin in March, is an international endeavour expected to involve 15 hospitals in the UK and Belgium.  The team hopes to recruit 105 women aged 25 to 55 with a persistent high-risk HPV infection. While 73 will be given two shots of a particular dose of the vaccine, the rest receive a placebo. They will then be tested for the presence of HPV over a period of 12 months. The current vaccine works by triggering the body to produce antibodies that stick to HPV and prevent an infection. However, if an infection has already occurred, the virus becomes hidden inside cells, where antibodies cannot get to it. The new vaccine tackles this by using a harmless virus to expose proteins produced by HPV to the body, helping the immune system to detect the hidden HPV virus and increasing the body’s efforts to clear the infection. “It is like setting off the smoke alarm and saying come and do something about this,” said Prof Lucy Dorrell of Oxford University, who developed the vaccine. If successful, the team says the vaccine could change the face of cervical cancer prevention. At present women are offered treatment if a smear test and subsequent examination reveal they have cells at high risk of developing into cancer – this treatment typically involves removing the cells. By contrast, women found to have an HPV infection alone or alongside small changes to cervical cells are generally asked to have another smear test 12 months later, in the hope that the body will have resolved the issue itself. For some the situation can be a purgatory of worry. “They say: ‘Can you prescribe something?’ and we have to say no, we just sit on it and wait,” said Hellner.  The new vaccine could allow action to be taken earlier – potentially even before a high-risk HPV infection is known to be persistent – preventing women from developing cancer or precancerous cells. The procedure to remove these cells can increase the risk of preterm births in future pregnancies.   Related: Cervical cancer self-tests may be key smear alternative – study    While the vaccine is not the first designed to clear HPV infections, it is expected to be more effective, not least because it is far broader, covering five strains of high-risk HPV instead of just one or two as other vaccines. A vaccine to help clear HPV, the team adds, would tie in well with the new approach to cervical screening that is currently being rolled out across the UK in which samples are tested for HPV first, before cell changes are examined – a development that could lead to cervical smearsbeing replaced with simple home tests.  The team says the new vaccine could be particularly beneficial in low- and middle-income countries which do not have strong cervical screening programmes or preventive vaccines for HPV.  Dr Belinda Nedjai of Queen Mary University of London who has worked on HPV detection but is not involved in the trial, said it was unlikely the new vaccine, even if effective, would clear the infection in everyone. “Simply the human system is different in everyone so it might be that these treatments won’t work for everyone,” she said. But even so, Nedjai said the planned trial was exciting. “I think it is very interesting and promising because it could offer a treatment option and stop the wait for these women who are borderline and are not treated immediately,” she said. “Even if the surgical procedure to remove [problematic cells] works, still there is a lot of anxiety for these women, [about] ‘is it going to come back?’,” she said.

153,cancer,"Shared ownership flats: ‘Mum died not knowing I would be left with £25,000 debt’","A woman has accused a housing association of saddling her late mother’s estate with a £25,000-plus debt that is growing by more than £1,000 a month. When Penny Ashcroft’s mother Lois Plowman died of cancer aged 69 in 2018, she owned a 25% share of a shared ownership flat in London – all she had to leave to her children. Plowman, a retired NHS radiographer, had been convinced shared ownership was a good investment. But, says Ashcroft, she would be horrified if she had known what a huge headache she had effectively bequeathed to her daughter, involving vast numbers of emails and phone calls, an ever-increasing debt and threats of repossession. She says that what her mother did not know was that after her death, her housing association landlord would effectively leave her with a five-figure debt. “My poor mum would be howling in her grave,” says Ashcroft. She says restrictions on the lease have made selling the flat extremely difficult, and she has not been allowed to sublet it. More than two years on, the flat remains unsold, despite the price being cut. “I’ve accepted a new offer, the fourth since we began marketing it. Even if this one goes through, the debt will likely stand at £30,000 by the time the deeds are transferred,” she says. Plowman worked for the NHS until her retirement in 2013. Four years earlier, she had been able to buy a 25% share in what was then a new flat in a social block at a development near Chelsea Bridge, close to Pimlico. On the 75% that she did not own, rent was payable to housing association A2Dominion. She died in January 2018, two days shy of her 70th birthday, triggering the start of a lengthy correspondence between her daughter – the administrator of her estate – and the housing association. Faced at that point with paying almost £1,000 a month to cover the rent and service charge, and with no money in the estate other than the equity in the flat, Ashcroft asked if she could sublet the property in order to help meet the costs until it could be sold. But she was told this was not permitted as it would be a breach of the lease. “I was told it was not possible for someone to live in the flat and cover the rent, even while it was being sold. I was not able to find that sort of money and had no option but to allow an unauthorised debt to accrue,” says Ashcroft, who lives in south-east London. By April 2018 the housing association was contacting her about “the high level of arrears” – at that point the debt stood at £2,850. Early that autumn, A2Dominion conceded that, “unfortunately”, it had not been able to find a buyer for the flat, so Ashcroft had the right to take it to the open market. She signed up with an online estate agent, though little interest was shown in the flat. “It was overvalued, and I was not permitted to accept low offers without a penalty,” she claims. By November 2018 the amount owed had grown to more than £10,000, and then in March 2019 A2Dominion wrote to say that a “notice of seeking possession” would be served on her. Ashcroft appointed a solicitor who, she says, was successful in fighting the repossession, but the housing association still would not allow the flat to be down-valued, let out or brought back into its ownership. Last summer, it looked like there might be a breakthrough. “A memorandum of agreement to sublet was issued by A2Dominion on 13 August, to which we responded on 5 September, but no further response has been received,” says Ashcroft. More than two years after her mother’s death, with the debt standing at £25,157 in January, she is hopeful that the latest offer will work out. But she adds: “If they had allowed it to be sublet or bought it back, no debt need have built up. As it is, when the £25,000 and growing debt is cleared and the legal costs paid, what mum was told would be a good investment will have turned out to be nothing but a sinkhole.” In response, Nicki Morrison, A2Dominion’s director of residential services, told us: “We would like to extend our condolences to Ms Ashcroft, and we are sorry this has added to her stress at a very difficult time.” She adds: “As a form of affordable housing, shared-ownership homes are bound by restrictions on subletting so that they are used by the people who need them. “However, given the circumstances, we extended an offer that would have allowed Ms Ashcroft to sublet the property. We regret that we have not progressed this offer since then, and we are working with her to find a resolution. “Shared ownership is a great option for many people and helps them to buy a place of their own. We are sorry that on this occasion it has not been a positive experience for Ms Ashcroft.”"
154,cancer,"Knife crime is a cancer on society, says judge in Yousef Makki case","A judge condemned knife crime as a “cancer on society” as he detained two teenagers after the fatal stabbing of a private school pupil who was an aspiring heart surgeon.Yousef Makki, 17, died from a single stab wound to the heart following an argument with a friend, known as Boy A, in an upmarket part of Greater Manchester on 2 March.Boy A, 17, admitted stabbing Makki but said he acted in self-defence and denied murder. He was found not guilty of both murder and manslaughter following a trial at Manchester crown court.The teenager was sentenced to a 16-month detention training order after admitting perverting the course of justice and possession of a bladed article. He will spend half of that sentence in custody.The boy, dressed in a suit and tie, stared straight ahead and gave no reaction as he was led to the court cells, while members of his family sobbed and hugged each other in the public gallery.The judge, Mr Justice Simon Bryan QC, condemned what he described as a “warped culture where possession of knives is deemed to be cool and aesthetically pleasing” as he sentenced the defendants.Boy B, who was not charged with murder or manslaughter, was sentenced to a four-month detention training order after he pleaded guilty to carrying a knife in an incident earlier that day. He too will spend half of that sentence in custody, and the remaining half under the supervision of youth offending teams in the community.Makki was from a single-parent, Anglo-Lebanese family in the Burnage area of south Manchester and had won a scholarship to attend Manchester Grammar School. Just days before his death he had attended a talk on studying at Oxford or Cambridge universities.The trial heard how Makki died after a row with his friends, Boy A and Boy B, also 17, following a botched attempt to buy £45-worth of cannabis in the leafy village of Hale Barns.Boy A was attacked, leading to a later confrontation with Makki. Boy A told the jury he pulled out a flick-knife because Makki had produced a knife – a claim denied by the victim’s family – and Boy A said he then accidentally stabbed his friend in self-defence.The judge said the background to the case was “depressingly all too familiar” and that carrying knives, mixed with drugs and drug-dealing, was a “recipe for disaster”. He said: “It must stop. There is nothing cool about knives.” The judge added: “It is clear that both of you had an unhealthy fixation with knives which is all too common amongst the youth of today. It must stop. “There is nothing cool about knives. Their carrying all too often leads to their use and to tragedy, and it is a fallacy that they can keep you safe – very much the reverse, as events all too often demonstrate. “Knife crime is a cancer on society, and it affects all spectrums of society – the message that must be brought home is that knives kill, and knives ruin lives. The best legacy of Yousef’s tragic death would be if this message could be got across – and knives regarded as ‘uncool’ by the young in society going forward.” Makki’s family boycotted the sentencing in order to “make a stand” against Boy A’s acquittal. Amid chants of “Justice for Yousef”, a 200-strong crowd made up of family members, schoolmates and supporters gathered on the steps of Manchester crown court to express their disappointment that no one has been found responsible for Makki’s killing. Makki’s elder sister, Jade Akoum, 28, told the Guardian that the family would keep fighting for justice, whether it was through civil action or whatever other avenue possible.Boy A’s barrister, Alistair Webster QC, said the teenager had expressed “genuine insight and regret” about the consequences of his actions and that he “does not seek to underplay the serious nature of his role in the death of his friend”.Webster said Boy A had acknowledged that his sentence for carrying a knife and perverting the course of justice “will never be long enough” for Makki’s family or the wider public.The defence barristers said the two 17-year-olds saw carrying knives as “something of a joke” and that they had not acknowledged the dangers “despite their intelligence”.“Although the consequences weren’t intended, they do of course vividly illustrate the dangers of carrying knives,” he said.The trial had heard that Boy B bought two knives they carried on the day of Makki’s death from an app called Wish. Giving evidence during the trial, Boy A said he found the blades “cool” and “sleek” and that he carried one for protection.Eleanor Laws, representing Boy B, told the court that her client had never carried a knife before that day and was of positive good character and had no criminal record. He was a “hard-working, pleasant, gentle, kind, caring” boy who had been left with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression following his friend’s death.Webster said Boy A was at risk of serious harm and that he had been identified online by “self-righteous armchair warriors”, adding that this risk had been “exacerbated by the local member of parliament, who really should know better” – a reference to the Labour MP Lucy Powell who suggested jurors may have reached a different conclusion had Boy A been “black, at state school and from, say, Moss Side”. • This article was edited on 23 August 2019 to amend details relating to Boy B."
155,cancer,"New war on cancer aims at longterm survival, not cure","Leading scientists are embarking on a new war against cancer, aimed not necessarily at curing it but at turning it into a condition that people can live with. The world-renowned Institute of Cancer Research is launching what it calls the first-ever “Darwinian” cancer programme. Just as with antibiotics, they say, cancers can evolve to become resistant to the drugs used to treat them. Cancer cells that are not killed off by chemotherapy or even immunotherapy will eventually mutate and adapt to form new tumours. The cancer returns in metastatic or advanced form, often elsewhere in the body, and is usually fatal. The ICR wants to refocus its work, aiming not just to kill cancer cells but to destroy their ability to evolve. The aim is to take the lethality out of cancer and turn it into a disease that – if a cure is not possible – will no longer shorten or ruin lives, in the same way that HIV is controlled for millions of people on antiretroviral drugs. Prof Paul Workman, chief executive of the ICR, said his team was hugely excited. “It’s about tackling the biggest challenge we face in cancer treatment and cancer biology, which is drug resistance,” he said. Their first drug to slow down or stop the evolution of cancer cells could be available in 10 years, they say. It will target a molecule called APOBEC, which is crucial to the workings of the immune system, but is also hijacked in over half of cancer types to speed up evolution of drug resistance. The drug could be given alongside other cancer-killing drugs. “We believe this will be the first treatment in the world that, rather than dealing with the consequences of cancer’s evolution and resistance, aims to directly confront the disease’s ability to adapt and evolve in the first place,” said the ICR’s Dr Olivia Rossanese. Dr Rossanese will be head of biology at the new Centre for Cancer Drug Discovery, next to the Royal Marsden hospital in Sutton, Surrey, which the ICR is building to advance this work programme. It will house scientists from many disciplines, from AI and advanced maths to the biological sciences. Workman said they need £15m more to complete the centre, in addition to the £75m the ICR has already invested. He hopes for philanthropic donations. If they get the money, he said, “we can bring together under one roof experts in cancer therapeutics alongside others studying evolution in animals, cells and individual patients, to create a new generation of cancer treatments.” The researchers are already working on a number of projects. Dr Andrea Sottoriva, who will be deputy director of cancer evolution at the new centre, said they were exploring “the idea of using combinations of existing drugs together or in sequence to do what we call evolutionary herding”. They want, he said, “to play evolution in our favour and push cancers towards an evolutionary dead end.” Using AI, they could work out how to drive development of the cancer cells towards forms that are more susceptible to drugs. Workman said tackling cancer evolution was a fundamentally new approach. “What we’re really looking at here is a culture change – among cancer researchers and clinicians, and also among patients,” he said. “We will always strive to cure cancer, but in advanced disease where that may not be possible an evolutionary approach opens up the prospect of long-term control with a good quality of life. “We would like to take some of the fear away from advanced cancer, and hope patients will benefit from new approaches that may not always give them the ‘all clear’, but could keep cancer at bay for many years.”"
156,cancer,Aspirin and the treatment of cancer,"A recent review of the medical literature shows that low-dose aspirin taken by patients with cancer (Bitter pill: is aspirin really a wonder drug?, G2, 24 January) is associated with a reduction in cancer deaths, and a reduction in cancer spread (metastases). Over 70 studies have been published, together including 120,000 cancer patients taking aspirin and over 400,000 cancer patients not taking aspirin. A meta-analysis shows a 24% reduction in cancer deaths and a 19% reduction in deaths from all causes in patients taking aspirin. That is: at any time after a diagnosis of cancer, about 19% more patients taking aspirin are alive, compared with patients not taking aspirin. An author of each report was contacted and asked about bleeding in their patients: 31 replies were received and only one author reported an excess (11%) in the number of patients taking aspirin who had had a bleed, compared with patients not taking aspirin. A summary of all this evidence is in Public Library of Science, an open medical journal (PLOS: Aspirin in the Treatment of Cancer). Despite claims on the web and elsewhere of harm, including unsupported claims of deaths due to aspirin, a number of reviews of the published evidence have shown that within each thousand people taking aspirin, only one or two will have a bleed each year, and the bleeds associated with aspirin are less severe than the spontaneous stomach bleeds that occur across the community due to a stomach ulcer or infection. Relevant evidence on this is also available at PLOS (Aspirin and fatal bleeding). While pharmacologists search for more effective anti-cancer agents, information on low-dose aspirin as an additional treatment of cancer – having a high probability of benefit and a low chance of harm – should be made widely available to patients, to enable informed discussions with their doctors.Professor Peter Elwood, Ms Janet Pickering and Dr Gareth MorganDivision of population medicine, school of medicine, Cardiff University  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

157,cancer,Don't forget people with illnesses other than Covid-19,"We need to remember that people are still getting sick and ill from diseases other than Covid-19, and retain our care and compassion for those who do not fall in the current global pandemic priority spotlight. Last week, due to Covid-19, my husband was given a terminal cancer diagnosis over the phone. He did not even know he had cancer, let alone that it was untreatable. Due to Covid-19, he was told he would not be offered palliative chemo. Due to Covid-19, he cannot see or hug his loving and supportive family, and we cannot comfort each other together in the face of such devastating news. National planning must rightly focus on the challenge from the pandemic, but surely, for humanity, local service delivery must leave some space for a more compassionate approach.Name and address supplied"
158,cancer,The Observer view of Matt Hancock’s cancer gaffe,"We are ruled by a government that has, in a very short time, acquired a striking reputation for the crassness of its members’ utterances and actions. Examples include Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley’s admission that she had been unaware that nationalists did not vote for unionists and unionists did not vote for nationalists, the most elementary feature of politics there. We also have a transport secretary, Chris Grayling, who tried to defend himself when it was revealed he had been pouring public money into a “ferry company” that possessed no ships, while Boris Johnson, despite only having the briefest of stints as foreign secretary, racked up a staggering number of howlers that ranged from an attempt to promote whisky in a Sikh temple (where alcohol is forbidden) to claiming the Libyan city of Sirte had a bright future once they “cleared the dead bodies away”. But even by these hare-brained standards, last week’s pronouncement by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, on the merits and implications of genetic screening represents a new low in ministerial ignorance, one that has rightly been denounced by the medical profession. Ahead of a speech at the Royal Society, Hancock discussed his decision to take a commercial genetic test to establish his risk of developing a number of medical conditions. Results indicated his chances of developing prostate cancer before he was 75 were almost 15%, he revealed, adding that he would now be making future bookings for further screening. The announcement provoked the derision of doctors and scientists. As one geneticist, Professor David Curtis from University College London’s Genetics Institute, observed: “There is no such thing as a screening appointment for prostate cancer. We don’t do them because they don’t work; they’re a waste of time and money.” Yet these tests, shunned by the NHS, were promoted by Hancock, revealing the politician’s appalling ignorance about the health service he is charged with running. In fact, scientists still find it difficult to predict from genetic tests who will develop cancers, heart conditions and other diseases. Nor is Hancock’s risk of prostate cancer, measured at 15%, particularly high. One geneticist described it as modest. Certainly his results do not merit his near hysterical reaction. Hancock’s remarks will be picked up by the public and will, undoubtedly, lead to more worried people visiting GPs to discuss borderline results from these tests – at a time when general practice is already struggling to cope with demand. Rather than helping the NHS, our health secretary’s thoughtless outpourings have only made its day-to-day running even harder."
159,cancer,HPV infections nearly eliminated in England under vaccine scheme,"Very few sexually active young women are now getting infected with the virus that causes most cervical cancers following the introduction of a mass HPV vaccination programme in schools, Public Health England has said. In 2008, the year vaccination began, 15% of young women were infected with HPV (human papilloma virus), which circulates among sexually active people. Two types, HPV16 and 18, cause the vast majority of cervical cancers. Data from PHE shows the infection rate dropped to 2% in 16- to 18-year-old women between 2014 and 2018. In a sample of 600 young women tested in 2018, no infections were found. The figures will boost hopes that cervical cancer cases will drop dramatically in the years to come and eventually will be eliminated. There is no measurable impact on cancer incidence yet. The cancer is most often diagnosed between the ages of 25 and 29, usually picked up by screening. Vaccination coverage against HPV is high: 83.9% of girls in year 9 have had the recommended two shots. Dr Vanessa Saliba, a consultant epidemiologist with Public Health England, said the figures were clear evidence that the immunisation programme was succeeding. “With millions of young women protected by HPV vaccination, we expect to see big reductions in cervical cancer in years to come and the introduction of the boys’ programme will accelerate this progress,” she said. “I encourage parents of all eligible girls and boys to ensure they take up this potentially life-saving vaccine when offered.” Vaccination was introduced for boys last year because HPV can also cause anal and penile cancer and some types of head and neck cancer. HPV6 and 11 cause 90% of genital warts, the prevalence of which also fell for the first time in 16- to 18-year-old women, from 7-10% between 2010 and 2017 to 4% in 2018. The health minister Nicola Blackwood said: “Thousands fewer women and men will be diagnosed with cancer as a result of the HPV vaccination programme and declining infection rates. It’s incredible to think that this vaccination is helping us eradicate cervical cancer for good.” Eleven million doses of the vaccine have been given to young women in England, meaning more than 80% of women aged 15 to 24 are protected, according to PHE. However, a group of researchers who have published an analysis of data from clinical trials of the vaccine in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine have questioned whether vaccination will prevent cases of cervical cancer. The trials combined cases of high-grade cervical disease with low-level changes in cells that can spontaneously disappear, they said, and followed up on most of the women for six years or less. “We found insufficient data to clearly conclude that HPV vaccine prevents the higher-grade abnormal cell changes that can eventually develop into cervical cancer,” said the lead researcher, Dr Claire Rees, of Queen Mary University of London. Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said there was no doubt that the vaccines protected against types of the virus that caused cervical cancer. “But the authors in their provocative piece do raise some important points highlighting that HPV vaccination isn’t the absolute panacea for cervical cancer prevention, for example in cases where HPV infection isn’t the cause,” he said. “If anything, the take-home message to me is that we still need to understand more fully the long-term benefits and efficacy of HPV vaccination and ensure that adequate cancer screening is available to all.”"
160,cancer,HPV vaccine 'offers chance' of wiping out cervical cancer in rich countries,"Elimination of cervical cancer in wealthy countries such as the UK may be possible within decades, say experts, following a major study showing the success of the HPV jab in protecting women. Human papilloma virus, which is sexually transmitted, can cause cervical cancer as well as anogenital warts. Data from high-income countries shows vaccination has led to an 83% reduction in HPV infections in 15- to 19-year-old girls over five to eight years. Among women aged 20 to 24, infections are down 66%. Major reductions also took place in anogenital warts and precancerous lesions, which can be the precursor to cervical cancer. HPV vaccination has only been available for 10 years, so the effect on cancers is not yet known, although it is predicted they will also drop significantly. The research, published in the Lancet medical journal, will bolster the determination of the World Health Organization, which is setting goals for reducing the number of cases of cervical cancer to no more than four per 100,000 population, below the threshold for a rare disease. Prof Marc Brisson from Laval University, one of the authors, said: “We’re working with the WHO, using mathematical modelling to determine when elimination would occur. “We don’t have a precise date. High vaccine coverage has to be maintained. It depends on the country and how much coverage and screening there is, and how many cohorts have been vaccinated.” Australia, where takeup of the vaccine is almost as good as in the UK, is now working towards elimination. “There could be elimination in decades,” said Brisson. The study shows vaccinating multiple cohorts of girls at different ages, as took place at the beginning of the programme in the UK, helps bring down HPV infection rates. HPV vaccination was introduced for girls aged 12 in schools in the UK, but a catchup programme allowed girls up to the age of 18 to be vaccinated as well. From September, the UK will begin offering HPV vaccination to boys, which will further reduce the pool of the virus. The study shows older women and boys and men already get some protection from HPV-related diseases from the vaccination of girls. Dr David Mesher, a principal scientist at Public Health England, said it was too early to see data on a drop in cervical cancer cases because this takes years to develop. At the moment, the burden of cervical cancer is in women who were too old to be vaccinated – the vaccine is not very effective in women who are sexually active and may have already been exposed to the virus. But he said: “There is every indication we will see it in the near future. We will start relatively soon to see an impact in younger women.” Brisson said there could be a noticeable drop in cervical cancers within 10 years.   Related: We know it's effective. So why is there opposition to the HPV vaccine ?    The paper looked only at studies carried out in high-income countries where there has not been opposition to the vaccine. In Denmark, Ireland and a few other European countries, a scare over claims that the jab had caused girls to become ill, fuelled by TV documentaries showing them in wheelchairs with ME-type symptoms, led to a drop in vaccination rates. In Japan, the vaccination programme was suspended. There is also no data from less wealthy countries, where there are the highest numbers of women with and dying from cervical cancer. In 2018, there were 569,000 cases of cervical cancer worldwide and 313,365 deaths, 80% of which were in these countries. “What we see is that in many low- to middle-income countries, there is no vaccine at all,” said Brisson. “These are the countries with the highest burden of cervical cancer. The results show that the vaccines are working towards preventing cervical cancer, so I hope that we will be able in coming years to increase vaccination coverage in many of the countries that need it most.” Low-income countries have been slow to introduce the vaccine and their monitoring systems are not good enough to produce useful data, said Mark Jit, a professor of vaccine epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “If we are to realise the dream of eliminating cervical cancer then we will need to ensure that our limited supplies of vaccines are prioritised to the countries that need them the most,” he said. Robert Music, the chief executive of Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust in the UK, said the drop in infections was “truly exciting news”. He added: “We’re lucky to have the HPV vaccination programme here in the UK, and this study supports the imminent rollout of the gender-neutral HPV vaccine. However, this study also shows the urgent need for all countries without a vaccination programme to be supported in establishing one. “This study furthers the growing evidence to counteract those who don’t believe that this vaccine works, which is now extremely encouraging. We sincerely hope this will boost public faith in the HPV vaccine so that more lives can be saved and we get closer to a world where cervical cancer is a thing of the past.”"

We both knew he was right. This is the uneven geometry of human emotions: the negatives tend to be much more powerful than the positive. Misery always lasts longer – and digs in deeper – than joy. Mistakes linger while triumphs are fleeting. And yes, bad news is more gripping than good. The big question is why. Any thoughts?

Students first select examples of local intangible culture which are in danger of being lost or reduced to superficial shows for tourists, such as traditional dances and festivals. Then they develop investigative projects using project-based learning around questions such as: “How and why has the tradition changed?” and “Why do people participate?”. Finally, they develop apps to summarise their investigations and share their investigations back to their communities. The project shows the power of using new innovative technologies to promote respect and re-valuing of traditional cultures in a country with poor education outcomes, and where culture is all too often reduced to nothing more than a product to sell to tourists.

162,cancer,Roundup cancer link: Australian firms consider lawsuits over exposure to weedkiller,"At least two Australian law firms are considering filing lawsuits against the manufacturer of Roundup after a landmark US court verdict in which a couple were awarded US$2bn after a jury agreed the weedkiller caused their cancer. On Sunday the Sydney Morning Herald reported that a number of local councils in Sydney were reviewing their use of the product, while the Victorian state government has launched its own review of glyphosate – the active ingredient in Roundup. At the same time, two Australian firms, LHD Laywers and Maurice Blackburn, are investigating a potential lawsuit against the product’s manufacturer, the German pharmaceutical corporation Bayer.   Related: Monsanto must pay couple $2bn in largest verdict yet over cancer claims    It follows a decision by a jury in California ordering Monsanto – owned by Bayer – to pay more than $US2bn to a couple who got cancer after using its weedkiller, the third and largest verdict against the company over Roundup in the US. Jonathan Walsh, principal at Maurice Blackburn, told Guardian Australia the firm had fielded “hundreds of inquiries” since late 2018 from people exposed to glyphosate. “It’s people from all walks of life, mums and dads using the product every weekend doing the garden, to more heavy users like those involved in vegetation management in particular and also people from the farming community where they use a lot of this product day in and day out,” he said. “So we’re actively investigating a number of cases and we’re in the stage of getting expert evidence to help support individual actions.” Walsh said Maurice Blackburn had considered a class action but “at this stage we’re not pursuing that angle”. “That’s not to say we’ve ruled it out, we’re still keeping it active, but we’re looking at individual cases presently,” he said. But another firm, LHD, is currently circulating a class action investigation statement. “Monsanto (now Bayer), the creator of Roundup, is facing claims the company failed to warn users that extended exposure to the weedkiller has been linked to certain forms of cancer,” it states. “As a result, thousands of lawsuits have been filed by cancer victims against Monsanto in the US, alleging that the weedkiller causes cancer. Juries in two recent cases have reviewed the Roundup cancer evidence, found Monsanto liable and ordered the company to pay millions of dollars in damages to victims. “LHD Lawyers are encouraging those affected by Monsanto’s Roundup to register their interest for a case evaluation. You may have a right to demand compensation from Monsanto for physical pain, mental suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, physical impairment, grief, anxiety, and emotional distress.” The safety of Roundup, the most commonly used herbicide in the world, has been the subject of fierce debate internationally. While Monsanto and Bayer insist the product is safe, in 2015 the World Health Organisation’s International Agency for Research on Cancer ruled glyphosate was “probably carcinogenic to humans”. In April the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry published a 257-page report saying it could not rule out a link between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma and suggesting more research was needed. However, in an interim decision in May, the US Environmental Protection Agency found the product does not cause cancer or other health problems if it is used according to instruction labels, and in Australia the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority says the product is safe if used correctly. To date there have been no cases centred on the product run in Australia, but in the US Bayer has lost three court battles against people suffering cancer in the last 12 months while there are reportedly another 13,000 plaintiffs lining up to sue the company. In May, a jury in California ruled on Monday that Monsanto was liable for the non-Hodgkin lymphoma of Alva and Alberta Pilliod. The jury ordered the company to pay $1bn in damages to each of them, and more than $55m total in compensatory damages.   Related: Government ministers should ban Roundup – not sing its praises | Natalie Bennett    That decision followed two consecutive trial wins for families taking on Monsanto over Roundup, which research has linked to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer that affects the immune system. Dewayne Johnson, a former school groundskeeper with terminal cancer, won a $289m victory in state court last year, and Edwin Hardeman, who sprayed Roundup on his properties, was awarded $80m in the first federal trial this year. Following the Pillio case, Bayer released a statement saying it was “disappointed” with the decision and planned to appeal. “We have great sympathy for Mr and Mrs Pilliod, but the evidence in this case was clear that both have long histories of illnesses known to be substantial risk factors for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), most NHL has no known cause, and there is not reliable scientific evidence to conclude that glyphosate-based herbicides were the ‘but for’ cause of their illnesses as the jury was required to find in this case,” Bayer said at the time."
163,cancer,Labor's $2.3bn cancer plan explained: breakthrough or 'black hole'?,"Labor’s $2.3bn cancer package to tackle out-of-pocket costs and waiting lists gives it a big positive story to tell about healthcare but the Coalition has gone on the attack, arguing it is giving voters false hope that all treatments will be free. On Monday the health minister, Greg Hunt, released health department data that shows eliminating out-of-pocket costs for all 421 cancer-related Medicare benefits schedule items would cost $6.8bn over four years. So what will voters get for Labor’s $2.3bn and what would still be left to pay for Australians with cancer? What is Labor’s $2.3bn cancer package? In his budget reply speech, Bill Shorten promised, if elected, Labor would spend $2.3bn to fight cancer. The package includes:  $600m to improve access to and affordability of diagnostic imaging, with up to six million free cancer scans funded through Medicare $500m to cut public hospital wait times for cancer treatment through a national partnership agreement with the states $433m to fund three million free consultations with oncologists and surgeons for cancer patients, through the creation of a new bulk-billed Medicare item $125m for cancer research A guarantee that every drug recommended by independent experts will be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme  Shorten has sold the policy with the now-familiar line that “cancer makes you sick but it should not make you poor”.   Related: Federal election 2019: health department says $6.8bn cancer cost not Labor's policy – politics live    On Sunday he promised “to everyone caught up in the battle against cancer – your tests and scans and ultrasounds and MRIs will be covered by Medicare, your appointments with specialists and oncologists, your chemo, your radiation therapy will be covered by Medicare, and the cancer medication that you need will be funded by the PBS”. Won’t doctors just up their fees? At the moment the Medicare rebate for specialist cancer consultations is about $60. The way Labor’s policy works is that a new Medicare item will be created with a rebate of $150, but specialists will need to bulk bill their customers to get access to the higher rebate. So doctors can still charge whatever they want, but they won’t get the higher rebate if they do. But it’s not free for everyone? The opposition says the Parliamentary Budget Office has costed the specialist consultations proposal at $433m, and calculated it would lift the bulk-billing rate from 36% to 80% for surgeons and from 43% to 85% for oncologists. These costings have not been released. Experts have noted the policy will therefore not guarantee that every patient will not incur any out-of-pocket costs – although it should increase the likelihood that they will. There are also questions about whether bulk-billing incentives will increase costs for people who are not bulk-billed. Campaigning in La Trobe on Monday, Shorten accepted that cancer treatment will not be free for everyone, explaining that he “can’t stop a patient who wants to exclusively go for private treatment” without bulk-billing. Shorten said that not all doctors will bulk-bill but patients will have “more choices”. While some doctors will continue to charge higher fees “someone down the road is actually going to accept the new more generous fee and see more patients”, he said. “So it is competition, friends, and competition is going to, I think, provide a better service.” What does the Coalition say? At first, Scott Morrison argued that Australians can get free treatment already in public hospitals, but he was forced to acknowledge that many patients still face out-of-pocket costs.   Related: Labor promises $500m to cut public hospital waiting times for cancer treatment    A new attack line was needed. So the Coalition then cited advice from the department that there are 421 Medicare benefits schedule items that “have the sole or primary purpose of the diagnosis, treatment or management of cancer” – and Labor is only promising savings for a few items. Other services used to fight cancer, including regular follow-up GP visits, will not be free. On Monday Hunt said: “Mr Shorten has been caught out making false promises. This is worse than Mediscare because he is playing with people’s health and hopes. “It is a disgraceful abuse of high office – a $5.7 billion black hole is proof of that – not only can’t Labor manage money, they can’t manage health and they do not deserve to be trusted to manage the country.” What are the politics? The 2016 election campaign was dominated by Labor’s negative Medicare campaign, which centred on the highly contentious claim the Coalition would privatise Medicare. When Malcolm Turnbull was re-elected, Hunt was tasked with neutralising any potential future scare campaign by matching Labor’s spending on hospitals and Medicare, where possible. But Labor’s program includes opposition to tax cuts for middle and high-income earners and other revenue-raising measures, and this gives it a war chest for higher social spending. As a result Labor’s 2019 campaign is in one sense a rerun of 2016 – promising Labor will do more for Australians’ health – but this time with a positive slant. The suggestion that Labor can prevent cancer impoverishing Australians is an over-simplification, but it’s a big idea that can help it win hearts and minds for a socially useful package. The Coalition’s rebuttal that this represents a “black hole” in Labor’s costings is a misrepresentation of what was promised. Last week, Morrison suggested the government would “look carefully” at Labor’s package “because we will all stand with those who are suffering with cancer”, which “should be above politics”. This implied the government could try and match the $2.3bn cancer package. But it seems that may prove too expensive for the Coalition, so instead they are in search of an attack line to counter Labor’s big new idea. Are these actually health department costings? A spokeswoman for the health department confirmed to Guardian Australia that – before the caretaker period – it did provide the number of cancer-related items on the Medicare benefits schedule and a costing for increasing the Medicare rebate. “The figure of $6.8 billion over the forward estimates represents the volume of current service items increased to the [Australian Medical Association] rates,” she said. “A response was provided prior to the commencement of the caretaker period.” “The department does not cost opposition policies and has not received any request to do so.” So yes, the $6.8bn cost is the health department’s estimate of eliminating out-of-pocket costs for all cancer treatments, but no, this is not Labor’s policy. So, will Labor’s plan eliminate out-of-pocket costs? No. But then again, Labor has never said that all cancer treatments will be free."

From her front porch in Reserve, Louisiana, Mary Hampton looks in every direction and sees ghosts. 
To her left is her brother Fred’s home. He died from cancer. On the right is another brother’s home. His wife, Olga Mae, she died from cancer too. Across the street? A neighbor who died from cancer just a couple of months ago. The list goes on and on. 
Hampton is not alone. Many residents in this tight-knit, predominantly black riverside town can rattle off a similarly jarring list of loved ones who have battled or died from cancer. 
“Almost every household has somebody that died with cancer or that’s battling cancer,” Hampton says. “It’s the worst thing you’d ever want to see: a loved one, laying in that bed, pining away, dying. Just to sit and look at them, and know you can’t do anything about it.” 
 
 More from Cancer Town... 
 
Reserve sits in the heart of an industrial corridor between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. For more than 30 years, it has been known to many of its residents as “Cancer Alley”. That designation stems from the toxic pollution that is belched out from chemical plants along the serpentine squiggles of the lower Mississippi River. 
For a long time, proof of that morbid title lay mostly in anecdote and suspicion. “We always wondered about the pollution, but we never really knew,” says Hampton, who, like many residents in the region, relied on petrochemical plants to make a living for much of her career. 
But the town underwent a profound awakening in December 2015, on the back of a government report on toxic air. The findings from America’s environment agency, the EPA, not only confirmed the existence of a profoundly higher risk of cancer throughout the region, but it pinpointed Reserve, a working-class town of about 10,000, at the bullseye. 
In the tract of land where Mary Hampton lives, the risk of cancer from air toxicity is 50 times the national average. The highest of anywhere in the US. In fact, five census tracts within the St John the Baptist parish, the municipality to which Reserve belongs, are in the top 10 cancer risk zones in America. 
And yet, those 2015 revelations were met with next to no action. 
“We felt like nobody cared. The attitude was ‘it is what it is so you all just live with it,’” says Hampton. “What are we supposed to do, stay here, be sick and die?” 
Residents across the parish routinely articulate similar feelings of abandonment; from their elected representatives, from industry, and, frequently, from the national media. 
For the next year, the Guardian will be reporting from Reserve and elsewhere in Cancer Alley on the battle the residents are waging for clean air. In a series of reports, films and public meetings we will track the progress of their fight, ask why local politicians are absent, and ask what residents of Reserve have to do to win the right to a clean and safe environment for their children. 
We will ask why a poor, predominantly African American town has had to live with a likely carcinogen for 50 years, and give voice to residents’ frustration, anger and sadness that their appeal for a healthy environment is falling on deaf ears. 
This is the first dispatch in that series. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
The toxic chemical plant next door 
A few blocks from Mary Hampton’s porch sits the primary cause of this extraordinary risk level: the Pontchartrain Works facility, and the chloroprene that belches from its stacks. Although there are more than 50 toxic chemicals that contribute to the risk here, chloroprene, the primary component of the synthetic rubber neoprene, is responsible for the vast majority. It is a product that has for almost a century been used all over the world in the manufacture of tyres, wetsuits, medical equipment and countless other products – and the Louisiana plant is the only place in the US that produces it.

Its primary component, however, is now considered by the EPA as “likely to be carcinogenic to humans”. 
Beginning in 1968, the factory, then owned by the chemicals company DuPont, emitted chloroprene into the air in Reserve without much attention. Residents complained about intermittent bursts of chemical odors, and told anecdotes of illnesses and ailment, for the most part without ever making a connection. 
But after the EPA’s December 2015 air toxicity report, which was based on more stringent estimates for the carcinogenicity of chloroprene, the anecdotes were finally backed by government science. Almost overnight, the plant now owned by the Japanese company Denka, was deemed responsible for the greatest risk of cancer of any manufacturing facility in the US. 
Finally, the residents felt vindicated. But angry, too. 
“I was angry, I felt hurt, and most of all I felt like, where are we to go?” Hampton says. 
Lydia Gerard, who lives a few blocks from Hampton and whose family goes back five generations in Reserve, says: “It just takes the wind out of you, it really does. It makes you want to throw your hands up.” Her husband died from cancer in 2018. 
“We can’t give up, and we won’t. We have to continue to let those plants know that we are looking at them. It may not be in my lifetime that anything gets done, but I’m praying that it is.”

A few months later, the EPA set up monitoring stations at six locations around the parish to monitor chloroprene emissions. The agency now stated that emissions of the chemical above 0.2 micrograms per cubic metre (ug/m3) in the air were unsafe for humans to breathe over the course of a lifetime. The readings were devastating. Routinely, chloroprene emissions were dozens of times above the EPA’s guidance, suggesting residents living close to the plant had been constantly exposed for decades. 
In January 2017, Denka signed a voluntary agreement with the state of Louisiana to reduce its pollution. By this point, with the Trump presidency in its infancy, the issue had begun to attract some national exposure. Up until that point coverage had been restricted to local media but the story then appeared in the Intercept, followed by CNN and NPR. 
But still, the high readings continued. 
On one day in November 2017 at a station at the fifth ward elementary school, which sits on the plant’s fenceline, chloroprene was recorded at a staggering 755 times above the EPA’s guidance. Nearly 400 young children attend the school, breathing the air each day. It sits about a thousand feet from the plant, closer than Mary Hampton’s front porch. 
Denka has consistently rejected the EPA’s guidance and its findings on cancer risk in ambient air in the parish, suggesting to the Guardian they are not based on “sound science”. 
“The safety and health of Reserve residents, the surrounding community and Denka Performance Elastomer’s [DPE] employees are the company’s top priorities,” said a spokesman for the company. “DPE operates its facility safely and within all permits written by the Louisiana department of environmental quality in accordance with existing standards designed to protect public health and the environment.” 
The EPA suggests that chloroprene emissions above 0.2 ug/m3 are unsafe for humans to breathe over a lifespan. Since 2016 the EPA has been monitoring air quality at locations around the plant including a nearby elementary school. They are routinely dozens of times above the 0.2 guidance. 
For Mary Hampton, the realities of Cancer Alley turned from a dream to a nightmare. Her father, Joseph James Sr, dreamed, in the midst of Jim Crow segregation, of owning a stretch of land his family could call home for generations.  
That was no simple feat. On his modest salary as a sugarcane drier, he had to rely on the compassion of a white seller who allowed him to pay in installments of $20 a week. Back then, banks in the south rarely lent to black people.

James was eager to buy property along the River Road, which for generations was land where black Americans could only have lived as enslaved people on sugar plantations, or after the civil war, as tenant sharecroppers. He built his family home on the front lot, brick by brick. All paid with cash. He hoped that through hard work and thrift, his progeny could cobble together some of the generational wealth that black Americans in the south have been routinely denied. 
That was a dream born before 1957 when DuPont bought the old Belle Pointe plantation next door, a plot of land that already carried its own dark secrets, and began constructing the new chemicals plant in an area once worked sun up to sun down by more than 150 enslaved black Americans. For many African Americans in Reserve, including Hampton, who trace their ancestry back to slavery in the area – the reminder of past atrocities is made even starker by knowing what the land has been used for since. 
“When you think about it, nothing has ever really changed,” she says. “First slavery, then sharecropping, now this. It’s just a new way of doing it.” 
As the EPA’s 2015 findings reverberated around the community, they gave rise to a profound realization for Hampton: she had been breathing toxic air for most of her adult life. Horrified, she joined with other residents to found the Concerned Citizens of St John the Baptist group. They have been organizing ever since.

‘Maybe they just don’t want to know’ 
Hampton’s group meets twice a month at a church in Reserve, but despite the group’s growing numbers, they have found little to no support from their elected representatives. 
In Louisiana, the petrochemical industry’s ties to society run deep. A recent industry study found that the chemical sector generates some $80bn annually and supports two of every seven jobs in the state. In large part that dominance owes to a historically lax regulatory environment and weak union protections. 
While the state has the power to enforce stringent regulations on the plant, or even close it down entirely, many residents in Reserve are unsurprised that it has taken a more lenient approach. 
The Louisiana secretary of environmental quality, Chuck Carr Brown, a former industry consultant, has worked with Denka to lower chloroprene emissions. Since 2016 the company has spent $30m retrofitting the plant to offset some air pollution. But the secretary has not committed the firm to the safe level guidance from the EPA, a target that, by Denka’s own admission, would be impossible for them to make “technologically feasible”. 
In 2016, Brown accused Hampton’s group of “fear-mongering” over the potential harm of the compound. The official declined to be interviewed for this article, but has since apologized for the remarks.  
Still, residents around the plant remain furious with the aspersion.  
“We have these supposed protectors in government, who are supposed to be watching out for us. But where are they when these people are treating us like guinea pigs, prone to genocide?” says George Handy, a 63-year-old resident who has lived most of his life next door to the plant.  
The industry and Brown also regularly cite research from the Louisiana Tumor Registry, which claimed in its most recent report that the term Cancer Alley “has no scientific validity”. The registry data, which tracks incidence of cancer out of the state university in Baton Rouge, has found that while some census tracts in the region have much higher incidence rates than the state average, others are much lower – and that none of that data is indicative of a disproportionate geographic risk.  
One of the few local political voices to express firm support for the activists is Larry Sorapuru, who sits on the parish’s nine-person council. Sorapuru, a former chemical technician who has seen two aunts die from cancer, lives just across the river from the plant in the town of Edgard. During a recent trip to Reserve, driving along the streets of many of some of his poorest constituents, Sorapuru was non-committal over why the issue had failed to garner significant local political attention. 
“Probably they [other parish council members] haven’t engaged with other environmental groups. Maybe they’re not realizing the health hazards involved. Maybe they just don’t want to [know]. Perhaps they don’t want to come out as being against Denka or DuPont. It’s a big company,” he says. 
The plant has, for generations, been a major jobs and tax source for the parish. According to records from 2017, Denka was St John the Baptist’s third largest employer that year. Records from 2012, when DuPont owned the factory entirely , indicate the company was the second highest property tax payer that year. 
A review of records by the Guardian also indicates that at least three parish officials have either worked for DuPont themselves or had family members employed by the company.

‘It is both racist and classist, but mostly racist’ 
Robert Taylor’s one-storey house sits even closer to the fenceline than Mary Hampton’s. When his wife Zenobia was diagnosed with cancer 16 years ago, he decided he had to get her out of Cancer Alley.  
“If we were gonna help her spend some quality time with what she’s got left, we had to get her out of this,” Taylor says. He now spends his days split between tending to his wife in southern California, and back home in Louisiana, where his adult daughter, Raven, is sick from a rare intestinal disease – gastroparesis – that he said doctors have tied to chloroprene. 
Like Hampton, the list of Taylor’s family members who have died from cancer is arresting. He lists his mother, sister and nephews – who all lived in Reserve – before pausing in a flash of frustration. 
“I still can’t believe that this one community could be asked to suffer this much, merely for the profit of these foreign corporations. What kind of people are they to knowingly wipe out a whole community of people for profit?” 
Taylor has been another of the leaders of the fight for clean air in Reserve since 2015, and he’s been more frustrated than ever as of late. Although it was clear from early on that DEQ, the state agency, was not committed to setting tighter enforceable limits, the 78-year-old had at least held out hope for the federal government. 
It was the EPA after all that had identified the extent of the problem, set the 0.2 µg/m3 standard, and begun the air monitoring. Surely they would have the teeth to hold Denka accountable for the pollution? 
But on a foggy February night this year, during one of the group’s regular meetings, Taylor received the most unsettling news he’d encountered through his four years engaged in the fight. 
In a startling moment of candor, the EPA regional director, David Gray, announced to Taylor and the other concerned citizens that it was “doubtful” the agency would ever set a legally enforceable standard for the toxin. “The fact of the matter is there is a sole source of chloroprene in the United States and it’s here,” Gray said, explaining that since rule-making was such a long and strenuous process, the agency would be apt to prioritize compounds that are present in more than one community. 
The disorientation among the crowd was palpable, cueing gasps of frustration and disbelief. 
Taylor was apoplectic. Visibly shaking, he told the government official: “I wouldn’t dare sell my house to a human family. I wouldn’t dare bring another human family into this.”

Reflecting on that moment a few months later, he recalled: “It caused a complete change in me. It took a few days to gather my wits back.” 
The announcement was made starker by the fact that historically, it has been the federal government that has stepped in to protect black communities in the south when state and local governments have been unwilling or unable to act. 
Taylor doesn’t shy away from what he sees as a clear racial component in why his town is left to breathe carcinogens. Like much of Cancer Alley, Reserve is predominantly black and low-income. Black Americans make up 60% of the population in the town, and the per-capita income of $18,763 is about 40% less than the national average. 
“The petrochemical industry and human beings cannot live and operate side by side,” Taylor says. “So they have decided they’re OK with just wiping us out, especially because of the fact that this is a poor black population. We were the lowest-hanging fruit.” 
Taylor’s intuition is that Reserve is being overlooked because of the racial and economic demographics has been demonstrated on a national level, a phenomenon now commonly described as environmental racism. EPA-funded research from 2018 found that non-white Americans and those below poverty level are more likely than others to live near toxic pollution, and that the racial correlation is stronger than the economic one. 
“In other words, the siting of polluting industrial facilities is both racist and classist, but mostly racist,” says Jennifer Sass, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council.

‘It’s much worse under Trump’ 
The context to that February evening was apparent to most people in the room: the Trump presidency’s assault on the EPA. The administration has already rolled back dozens of environmental protections making the likelihood of more federal intervention in Reserve slim to none. 
A Louisiana environmental scientist, Wilma Subra, has been providing technical assistance to communities dealing with environmental health issues for nearly 40 years, and she says the administration’s rollback of regulation has been unprecedented. 
Enforcement typically waxes under Democratic administrations and wanes under Republican ones. “[But] it’s much worse under Trump than it was under any previous Republican administration,” Subra says. 
Earlier this year the administration proposed a 31% budget cut to the EPA, which could spell yet further disaster for the residents of St John the Baptist parish. 
Subra visits Reserve every other week to brief residents on the EPA’s latest air quality readings, which she describes as an “extreme risk to their health”. 
“The community in St John are forced to inhale toxic air emissions where they live, work and worship,” she says.  
  
  
  
It is against this backdrop that Denka has pushed the Trump administration to withdraw the assessment of chloroprene as likely to be carcinogenic. Between 2017 and 18 the Japanese company spent $350,000 to hire lobbyists in Washington, records show. Calendars reveal Denka met EPA officials on three occasions during this time. A letter from the company’s chief executive, Koki Tabuchi, to the former EPA chief Scott Pruitt, written on June 26 2017 and later released under the Freedom of Information Act, reveals the company’s aggressive campaign.  
Tabuchi argued Denka had “suffered extraordinary hardship” because of what it defined as “flawed” science, which had “created unnecessary public alarm”. He was due to meet with Pruitt two days later.  
Despite the campaign, however, the EPA ruled against Denka and upheld its assessment. A company spokesman confirmed that Denka is appealing against the decision, which is currently under consideration by the EPA. The company plans to submit more documentation to the EPA by June this year.

In a statement to the Guardian, the EPA declined to comment on meetings with Denka because of “confidential settlement discussions”. But in a significant acknowledgment, the department stated it was working alongside the Department of Justice on a court-enforced agreement or “consent decree” with Denka. The EPA did not elaborate on the nature of this consent decree, which will be made public once finalized. 
But a source familiar with the investigation said the settlement, while significant, relates to dozens of regulatory violations discovered at the plant and is not expected to address future emissions. 
Denka is not the first to argue that the risks of chloroprene are overstated. DuPont, the compound’s creator, has also argued against government reclassification. But, quietly, the company has long been aware of the chemical’s risk. From the mid-1940s, DuPont scientists studied the effects of chloroprene on human health. 
In a 1956 technical manual on neoprene, marked as confidential and numbering hundreds of pages, the warning is short but stark. 
The document was unearthed by the Guardian amid thousands of records at DuPont’s archives in Wilmington, Delaware. It comes from DuPont’s first neoprene facility built in Kentucky in 1941 and closed in 2008 amid community outrage over the site’s emissions. The manual states that chloroprene “may enter the body either by inhalation or by absorption through the skin”. It warns that if consumed at high concentrations chloroprene “causes depression of the central nervous system and damage to vital organs”. 
  
DuPont did not respond to detailed questions about its five-decades-long neoprene operations in Reserve. A spokesman pointed out the company no longer produces the product at all and reminded the Guardian it sold production to Denka in 2015.  
“Prior to the sale, DuPont met the chloroprene limits in our DEQ air permit. We also met the Louisiana toxic air pollutant ambient air standard for chloroprene,” the spokesman said. 
Despite the company’s attempts to shirk engagement, it has not escaped potential legal ramifications. Last year DuPont, Denka and DEQ were sued by a group of residents. Robert Taylor is the lead plaintiff. 
“DuPont was there for 47 years unchecked,” says John Cummings, a veteran Louisiana trial lawyer leading the legal action. “These people were dying of cancer, children were going to schools and had to breathe this chloroprene gas daily. Nobody cared. And that’s why we’re taking action.”

A David-and-Goliath battle 
Even those with no connection to the battle in Reserve have watched on in horror. Dr Ron Melnick, a former government scientist who was one of the first researchers to find chloroprene’s links to cancer, was dismayed to hear about the rates of exposure to the chemical in St John the Baptist.  
“It’s shameful,” he says. “I wouldn’t even live in an area that the EPA says emissions are acceptable. For sure, I wouldn’t live or have my children in a place which exceeds the EPA limits.” 
  
Robert Taylor, Mary Hampton and the thousands of others living close to the plant do not have the luxury of choice. They believe their David-and-Goliath battle against Denka, DuPont, the state and federal government is now their only recourse to breathe clean air again. 
Taylor, who spent his life as a touring musician and working in construction, now accepts he has been thrust into a role that could define the rest of his life. 
“If standing up for what is right, looking our enemy in the eyes and saying, ‘We’re aware of you and we need you to stop and we’re going to do everything we can to protect our community, our people, our children’ … if that would make me a radical, then I guess I’ll have to accept that title.”

165,cancer,Scientists use editing tool to identify key cancer genes,"Researchers working with a revolutionary gene editing tool have discovered thousands of genes that are essential for the survival of cancer cells, holding out the prospect of major advances in treatment. Scientists from the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridgeshire worked with the Crispr/Cas9 system to disrupt every gene within 30 different types of cancer. This led them to identifying 600 genes that could be used in precision treatments that would mean sufferers not having to endure the side effects of options such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy.   Related: Gene therapy could treat rare brain disorder in unborn babies    One gene identified is Werner syndrome RecQ helicase, which researchers found was essential for keeping alive some of the most unstable cancers but which cannot currently be targeted. The research, which was a collaboration between the Wellcome Sanger Institute, the European Bioinformatics Institute and the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, was published in the journal Nature on Wednesday. It could help to bring down the cost of making effective cancer treatments: the institute said that it currently costs more than $1bn (£760m) to make a single drug, and that 90% of these fail during testing and development. Praising the tool that made the breakthrough possible, Dr Kosuke Yusa, the co-lead author of the findings, said Crispr was “incredibly powerful” and “enables us to do science at a scale and with a precision that we couldn’t do five years ago. “With Crispr we have discovered a very exciting opportunity to develop new drugs targeting cancers.” Dr Mathew Garnett, also co-lead author, said: “The Cancer Dependency Map is a huge effort to identify all the weaknesses that exist in different cancers so we can use this information to empower the next generation of precision cancer treatments. “Ultimately we hope this impacts on the way we treat patients, so many more patients get effective therapies.” Prof Karen Vousden, Cancer Research UK’s chief scientist, told the BBC: “What makes this research so powerful is the scale. “This work provides some excellent starting points and the next step will be a thorough analysis of the genes that have been identified as weaknesses in this study, to determine if they will one day lead to the development of new treatments for patients.”"
166,cancer,School at centre of Guardian's Cancer Town series may move students due to air pollution,"Local officials in Reserve, Louisiana, are examining the prospect of removing pupils from an elementary school situated a few hundred feet from a chemical plant that presents the highest risk of cancer due to airborne toxins anywhere in America, the Guardian has learned. The Fifth Ward elementary school, which educates close to 500 students aged up to 10 years old, has become a focal point in environmental activism in Reserve after emissions of a likely carcinogen, chloroprene, emitted by the nearby plant have been recorded at the school at levels hundreds of times above the safe limit recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).   series box   Reserve is the focus of a year-long reporting series by the Guardian, Cancer Town, which is examining local residents’ fight for clean air in a locality the EPA says has a cancer risk that is 50 times above the national average. The plant, the Pontchartrain Works facility, has been operated by the Japanese company Denka since 2015 and was run by the chemicals giant DuPont for just under five decades. It is the only place in America to produce the synthetic rubber neoprene. In a statement the St John the Baptist school board confirmed its executive committee had voted to “conduct a study to look into the feasibility of moving students from Fifth Ward elementary”. The study will examine the “financial impact of such a move and to determine how to address the matter with the courts because the district is still under and must comply with a desegregation order”. The move marks a turn in local authorities’ attitude to air pollution issues in the municipality. In November last year the school board was sued by a local parent who demanded they relocate students at Fifth Ward after residents and activists claimed they were being ignored by local officials. The lawsuit was later dismissed after agreement on both sides. “We want to make the right decision. That’s why we’re taking the proactive step of looking into the feasibility study … to see where it would take us, and what impact it would have on the school district itself to move the students around to another site in the district,” said Patrick Sanders, the St John the Baptist parish school board president. Sanders did not offer a timeframe of when the review would be completed.     Members of the Concerned Citizens of St John protest near a school in Reserve, Louisiana. Photograph: Julie Dermansky    Sanders, who has lived in Reserve all his life, said he had begun to consider the air quality issues in the area more closely after the death of his own sister from a rare neurological disease, neurosarcoidosis. “I grew up in that district. I’m still a resident of that district. I’m less than 500ft away from the plant site itself. I truly have some personal concerns about the air quality and the effect that it has on the local residents, myself included,” he said. But he warned that other members of the 11-person board were more skeptical of a move to disperse the students. “There are concerns from other board members that these are the same children that are going back into the community [near the plant]. Even if we disperse them to other schools for a period of eight hours, they’re coming back home to the same community and breathing the same air,” he said. Sanders has previously written to Denka in March 2019 to ask them to comply with a safe standard of chloroprene emissions suggested by the EPA. The EPA recommends a safe lifetime exposure limit of 0.2 micrograms per cubic meter of chloroprene, but readings at Fifth Ward have sometimes been hundreds of times above that. In November 2017 a reading was taken at the school that was 755 times above the EPA guidance. Denka, which has entered into a voluntary agreement with the state of Louisiana to reduce emissions by 85%, did not respond to a request for comment. Denka and DuPont are facing potential legal action from Louisiana’s environment agency, LDEQ, over alleged violations of the Clean Air Act."
167,cancer,US orders group to stop selling bleach 'miracle cure' for coronavirus,"The US government is attempting to rein in the activities of pseudoscience groups that have begun to peddle bleach solution as a “miracle cure” for coronavirus. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has taken rare action against a leading supplier of the supposed remedy, a group that goes by the name of Genesis II Church and operates out of Florida. A federal court last week issued a temporary injunction, ordering the group to stop selling “an unproven and potentially harmful treatment for Covid-19”. Despite the clampdown, the Guardian has learned other groups have begun to repackage bleach, which had been touted as a cure for autism and cancer, as a foolproof treatment for coronavirus. A closed membership group on Facebook run by a purported “chemist” in Grove City, Ohio, is also billing the bleach, known by its advocates as MMS, as a “cure” for Covid-19. Advocates of the pseudo-medicine adhere to a similar formula. Sodium chlorite and citric acid are combined to form MMS, or “miracle mineral solution”, which they fraudulently claim cures 95% of all known illnesses including cancer, Aids/HIV and malaria. In fact, when the two components are combined they produce chlorine dioxide, a powerful bleach normally used in industrial processes such as the manufacture of textiles. Last August the FDA issued an urgent warning, urging Americans not to buy or drink the product, which it said was a “dangerous bleach which has caused serious and potentially life-threatening side effects”. Drinking MMS can cause nausea, diarrhea and severe dehydration that can lead to death, the federal agency said. The Guardian has learned that Gregorio Placeres is running a secretive Facebook group called SCSINFO-AUTISM out of his Ohio home. The group, which has almost 17,000 members, can only be accessed with the approval of administrators of the site. Once inside the group, members are encouraged to drink a mix of six drops of sodium chlorite with 60ml of water. Children should take a similar dose, the group says. Anyone who contracts Covid-19 should double the dose by drinking it twice a day, it says. “Two takes a day until the syntoms cess for full [sic]”, the site says. A notice cautions new members that the bleach can induce “an oxidative crisis. This can be diarrhea or vomiting”. The notice goes on to state that in normal circumstances users would be advised to desist drinking the chemical after an adverse reaction. “But in case you are infected with Covid-19, you can continue with your shots.” The Guardian reached out to Placeres. He stood by the claim pushed in his Facebook group that the bleach can cure Covid-19, but denied that he sold any of the chemicals. “I just help people by telling them how to use it,” he said. Asked for his response to the US government advice that the bleach is potentially life-threatening, he replied: “The FDA has a financial interest in this problem because it’s run by people in the pharmaceutical industry.” Fiona O’Leary, a campaigner against pseudoscience whose work helped to get MMS banned in Ireland in 2016, said the FDA move against Genesis II was “long overdue. I’m delighted, and I hope it leads to a real prosecution. We need to see this in a criminal frame, the warnings alone don’t work.” The Genesis II group sells bleach product as MMS in Bradenton, Florida, where a makeshift factory has been set up in the backyard of Jonathan Grenon. He styles himself as a “bishop” of the church which was founded by his father, “Archbishop” Mark Grenon. The Guardian last year exposed how Genesis II openly peddled bleach at public meetings in Washington and New York states.  Last May the Guardian revealed that a Briton named Sam Little had helped to fund a network that was distributing MMS as a “cure” for malaria and cancer to 50,000 villagers in Uganda. He was arrested and jailed, though later released."
168,cancer,NHS patients have cancer scans cancelled after supplier problems,"Concerns have been raised that problems related to the supply of a substance used to screen for cancerous cells is causing delays for NHS patients in England, with many exposed to repeated cancellation of scans at short notice. Choline is a radiotracer injected into patients an hour before PET-CT scans, predominately when patients are feared to have a recurrence of prostate cancer. Without it the scans cannot go ahead. The worries surrounding its availability come as waiting times for cancer patients in England are at a record high, with almost one in four patients not starting treatment within the two-month target period. Karen Stalbow, the head of policy, knowledge and impact at Prostate Cancer UK, said: “Some men are facing lengthy delays in confirming their prognosis, as scans are repeatedly cancelled at short notice due to the shortage. “This causes major stress and anxiety for these men, leaving some with little choice but to pay around £1,500 for a scan which uses PSMA tracers as an alternative to choline. These scans are currently only available privately, with some men even travelling abroad to get access. “NHS providers must take immediate action to ensure that PET-CT scans are available to all men with suspected prostate cancer recurrence, starting first with restoring the supply of choline and then progressing the commissioning of a more effective tracer.” NHS England told the Guardian that problems with the supply of choline had been resolved.  But Richard Taylor, from west London, who is going through a cancer diagnosis for the third time in two years, initially had a scan at University College London Hospital (UCLH) scheduled for the end of April, more than three weeks after his appointment with his oncologist – which should precede it – because of unavailability of choline.   Related: Prostate cancer: radiotherapy could extend thousands of lives, study finds    Taylor said: “Someone in the NHS should be ashamed of the unnecessary stress they’re causing patients through a lack of reasonable forward planning to ensure essential tracers are reliable, easily available, and – if a batch fails – an alternative is quickly available. “When you hear there are likely to be lengthy delays in getting a scan, you feel like not coming out from under the duvet in the morning, as your worst fears may be realised in the near future by the cancer spreading in the time it takes the NHS to put measures in place that your treatment may reasonably progress.” UCLH had offered him a PMSA scan as an alternative, privately for £2,200, but after the Guardian contacted the hospital it offered him the same scan the next day on the NHS.  A UCLH spokeswoman said: “It is well-known that choline is a fragile tracer and its production can be relatively unreliable, leading to unpredictable short-term cancellations. We have been working constructively with NHS England to address the choline production issues and they recently agreed to fund PSMA scans for a limited period.” Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. About one in eight men will be diagnosed with the disease at some point in their lives, according to Prostate Cancer UK. Dr Wai Lup Wong, the chair of the NHS England cancer diagnostics clinical reference group, said: “There is not a shortage of choline … however, some patient scans were delayed last year when a supplier experienced difficulties whilst refurbishing one of its production sites. “It is important that all patients with suspected cancer have scans as promptly as possible and any delays, for whatever reason, are kept to an absolute minimum during what is a difficult time in patients’ lives.”"
169,cancer,"In the most polluted part of America, residents now battle the US's biggest plastic plant","Gail LeBoeuf makes an unlikely climate justice campaigner. Although the 67-year-old resident of Gramercy, a small town in south Louisiana by the banks of the Mississippi River, has been fighting against local pollution for the last few years, she spent most of her career working at an area plastics manufacturer. “These plants just kept popping up, one after another, built by these billionaires who decided they just want to make money. So they come into these little river parishes, and sweep everyone else aside,” she said. Stood by a soggy roadside, surrounded by sugarcane fields, she pointed to the horizon where the latest polluting plant in this heavily polluted region of the US, known locally as Cancer Alley, is due to be built. Named the Sunshine Project, the sprawling plastics facility owned by the Taiwanese plastics giant Formosa, has become a focal point in the fight against industrial pollution in the region. St James parish neighbours St John the Baptist parish, home to the most toxic air in America and the subject of a year-long Guardian series, Cancer Town. In January Louisiana’s Environment Department [LDEQ] granted the Sunshine Project its final set of permits, allowing for 800 tons a year of toxic pollutants to be blasted into the air around the complex’s 14 separate plants. The air here is already among the most polluted in America, and local campaigners like LeBoeuf have been arguing for years that the cocktail of new pollutants, including the cancer causing compounds ethylene oxide, styrene and benzine, mark an intolerable risk to their health. In the fifth district of St James parish, an area just 103 sq miles, there are already eight industrial plants operating. The new project is slated across 2,300 acres of land.     Sharon Lavigne, director of Rise St James at Louisiana’s department of environmental quality’s public hearing on whether to approve the 15 air permits for Taiwanese company Formosa Plastics. Photograph: Julie Dermansky for EarthJustice    The Sunshine Project will not only be a major contributor to local toxic pollution, but will also be a significant source of greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions. LDEQ has permitted Formosa to release an astonishing 13.6 million tons of greenhouse gases each year, the equivalent of three and a half coal fired power stations. A spokeswoman for Formosa said that the facility could emit less GHG than permitted, as the totals in the permit “were generated based on the facility operating at maximum levels, 100% of the year”. The spokeswoman did not cite a separate figure however. The spokeswoman said the company would “perform a variety of emissions testing and monitoring activities” at the facility. The permit marks the project as the single biggest emitter of climate pollution under construction in the US, according to an analysis of oil and gas industry proposals conducted by the Environmental Integrity Project, a DC based advocacy group. The sector announced about $204bn in spending on 340 new or expanded projects since 2010, according to the American Chemistry Council. Many of them are to produce plastics – which the research firm IHS Markit forecasts will grow an average of 3.5% to 4% per year through 2035. This boom in plastic production is fueled by cheap oil and gas released by fracking. The industry is planning 157 new or expanded plants and more drilling over the next five years, according to a report from the Environmental Integrity Project. These projects will release up to 227m tons of additional greenhouse gases by the end of 2025 – a 30% rise from the industry’s footprint in 2018. Steven Eric Feit, an attorney for the Center for International Environmental Law’s climate program, said oil companies are banking on plastics growth for when oil demand for transportation peaks.  “The story from the oil industry for how they’re going to see growth in the 21st century is plastics, that’s what they’re saying,” Feit said. Many of the biggest facilities are along the Gulf Coast – with eight of the top 10 by size in Texas or Louisiana. The other two are in Appalachia, a region already struggling with the toxic legacy and decline of the coal industry. Like other environmental justice battles in the deep American south, the fight to stop Formosa is being fought by a group of local black women, like LeBoeuf and Sharon Lavigne, founder of Rise. Sat at her home in Welcome, less than a mile from the proposed Formosa site, she argued that presidential candidates in the Democratic field, should be doing more to view the struggle against toxic polluters like Formosa in the context of the climate crisis.     Watertower in Welcome Louisaina near the site of Formosa’s planned petrochemical complex. Photograph: Julie Dermansky    “The federal government needs to step in on this,” she said. “And I think all the candidates for president talking about fossil fuels need to be in our corner too.” More recently, however, campaigners here have begun to realize they are also part of a global struggle against the climate crisis.  At a private town hall meeting on 20th January held with newly elected St James councilman Mason Bland, LeBoeuf and other activists from the environmental group Rise St James recalled pushing their representative to rescind a series of land use permits granted to Formosa. LeBoeuf said she also asked her local representative to think about Formosa’s direct links to the climate crisis. “Do you believe in global warming and climate change?” LeBoeuf recalled asking. “I’m not going to answer that question,” Bland replied, according to LaBoeuf. The Guardian contacted all seven members of the St James parish council, including Bland, to ask whether they were concerned about the climate crisis and Formosa’s contribution to it. None responded with answers to the questions.   divider   The discovery of fracking – a method of injecting fluid into the ground at a high pressure to release oil and gas – vastly expanded the supply available to drillers. In turn, oil and gas prices plummeted. Fracking has also made it cheaper to make plastics, which come from a byproduct of the extracted gas. And experts agree that the rapid boom in plastics production has been overlooked as the lower-emitting gas has allowed the US to phase out coal plants, at a benefit to the environment. “Industry is saying this is good because we’re replacing coal, but they don’t talk about what else they’re doing with it – which is making plastic and chemicals,” said Courtney Bernhardt, research director at the Environmental Integrity Project. According to a recent legal complaint filed against Formosa by lawyers representing local residents, the amount of greenhouse gases released by the plant will be the equivalent of 6.5% of Louisiana’s total energy related emissions by 2016 standards. The permits issued by LDEQ actively skirt the issue of greenhouse gas releases, arguing that because there is no way to measure precisely how the surrounding area will be affected by the emissions, there is no reason to block the construction.  Beyond greenhouse gases, the 157 oil and gas projects planned around America could emit thousands of tons of pollution that contribute to smog and the particle pollution that contributes to asthma and heart attacks. They will also emit sulfur dioxide – which damages the lungs, and nitrogen oxides – which feed fish-killing “dead zones” in waterways.   divider   Last month, Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards, a staunch supporter of the Sunshine Project, announced a new initiative to confront the climate crisis in the gulf coast state, which faces severe coastal erosion and rising sea levels as a consequence of global heating. “Louisiana will not just accept or adapt to climate change impacts,” Edwards, a Democrat, said at a news conference in Baton Rouge. “Louisiana will do its part to address climate change.” The governor has created a new “Climate Initiatives Task Force” to reduce emissions among the dominant oil, gas and petrochemical industries in the state, and has committed at least a further $115m to coastal restoration. Notably, Edwards did not announce any binding emissions reduction targets. Anne Rolfes, founding director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, described the plan as “laughable” and said the most effective and meaningful way to combat climate change in the state would be for a moratorium on new petrochemical facilities in the state. “If we’re serious about reducing carbon emissions, let’s move towards halting them,” Rolfes said. LeBoeuf and other members of Rise had not been contacted about the governor’s new taskforce and did not expect to be part of the initiative. As she stood at the grounds of the sprawling site, on which Formosa plan to begin construction this year, she spoke about the recent news that two suspected slave graveyards had been found on the land. Formosa did not inform the community of the archaeological discovery, which was only made public following a public records disclosure. The information has led Rise St James to argue that the parish council should reconsider its permits, an argument that has thus far had little traction. “It’s still a plantation,” said LeBoeuf, who traces her ancestry back through generations here. “Those people were slaves on the plantation back then. Now we’ll be slaves to an industrial plantation.”"
170,cancer,Superglue plant and ‘miracle berry’ among 2019’s new finds,"A snowdrop discovered on Facebook, a miracle berry that tricks your tastebuds and a rubbery shrub that oozes its own superglue are among new plant species that were discovered in 2019. Others identified by experts at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, include a ylang-ylang tree of which just seven individuals are known to exist, a new candy-striped violet and a fungus with pink fruiting bodies that can fight cancer and viruses. Discovering and giving scientific names to new species is the crucial first step to protecting them, the scientists said. Kew scientists officially named 102 plants and eight fungi in 2019, but many are already in danger of extinction. The major threats are the destruction of natural habitat for farmland, timber, dams and mining, as well as the impacts of the climate crisis. Plants account for 82% of all life on Earth by weight – humans are just 0.01% – and they underpin all life, producing oxygen and food and providing shelter and medicines. There are almost 400,000 known species of plant, and about 2,000 new species are named every year.     Rubroshiraia bambusae, a hypocrellin-producing genus which was given an official scientific name in 2019. Photograph: Cici Dong-Qin Dai/RBG Kew    “We all depend on plants,” said Martin Cheek, a senior botanist at Kew and who names about 10 new species a year. “It is shocking that we are still discovering so many. It is easy to think we know everything on this planet, but we don’t. The local people might know the plants, but they are unknown to science.” “It is important to name the plants now because natural habitat is disappearing rapidly,” he said. “Only when they have a name can they have an official assessment under the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and only then do we have a chance of getting national authorities to protect those areas.” The new snowdrop species was discovered in north-west Turkey when a paediatrician uploaded her holiday photos to Facebook, where they were spotted by a Ukrainian snowdrop specialist. The pair returned to the site and collected a sample, which was confirmed as a new species by Kew’s snowdrop expert Aaron Davis. The snowdrop has already been assessed as critically endangered.     Galanthus bursanus, a new species of snowdrop from north-west Turkey. Photograph: D.Zubov/RBG Kew    The new miracle berry species was discovered the rainforests of the Chimanimani Mountains, on the Mozambique-Zimbabwe border. The fruits of these species contain a compound called miraculin that blocks tastebuds so that sour foods, such as limes, taste sweet. The new species is classed as endangered, due to the continuing destruction of the forest. The rubbery shrub species was found on a single waterfall on the Bafing River in Guinea, west Africa. “They have some kind of biological superglue with which they can stick themselves to rocks to avoid being swept away, but this interesting compound hasn’t been investigated yet,” said Cheek. Kew scientists expect the shrub to become globally extinct when construction of a hydroelectric dam begins next year. “We have examples of species from that family that have been wiped out by other hydroelectric dams,” Cheek said. Plant extinctions in general are occurring at a “frightening” rate, according to scientists, and one in five of all plants are at risk. The rarest find in 2019 was the zonozono, a 20m-tall tree from the ylang-ylang family discovered in the Usambara Mountains of Tanzania. Just seven trees are known. The spectacular new violet family species was found in New Guinea.     Leaves of Mischogyne iddii, or the zonozono plant, of which only seven trees are known to exist. Photograph: Andrew R Marshall./RBG Kew    The bamboo fungus from Yunnan in south-west China was only given a formal scientific name in 2019, but has been used in the region as a traditional treatment for arthritis for more than 400 years. Scientific interest is increasing due to the discovery of compounds called hypercrellins in the fungus. When exposed to light, these compounds combat tumours, viruses and other fungi. Most new species are named after local places, but one Kew scientist took a more romantic approach. A new orange gladiolus found on top of a remote table mountain in Guinea is now called Gladiolus mariae, after Xander van der Burgt christened the plant after his wife Maria. “It is perfectly OK if other people name a species after you,” said Cheek. “But it would be considered very bad form to name a species after yourself.”"
171,cancer,Anti-FGM campaigner who was denied NHS cancer care dies,"An anti-FGM campaigner from Gambia, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer and denied NHS treatment, has died. The Guardian previously reported that the 54-year-old man known as Saloum, was denied free NHS medical treatment after he collapsed in the street last December. He died on Sunday evening after being rushed to Royal Derby hospital hours earlier. Friends who were with him when he died said that even in the final moments of his life he was fearful that he might once again be sent away from the hospital because he was unable to pay for his NHS treatment. Saloum fled Gambia a decade ago after falling foul of his government for condemning the widespread practice of female genital mutilation in his country. Three-quarters of Gambian women and girls aged 15 to 49 have undergone FGM. After his collapse in the street it emerged that on arrival in the UK he was subjected to labour exploitation. The Home Office was alerted and sent him a letter on 25 February this year stating: “There are reasonable grounds to believe that you have been a victim of modern slavery.” After Saloum’s collapse in the street last December he was diagnosed with two brain tumours and lung cancer and was told he did not have much longer to live. Following initial treatment he was sent away because he was not eligible for free NHS care as an undocumented migrant. After pressure from the charity Doctors of the World, which argued that treatment for his cancer was urgent and immediately necessary, he was subsequently given some treatment at the hospital. Saloum became homeless following his collapse in the street – he was previously accommodated in a place he said was unfit for human habitation by the man who subjected him to labour exploitation. His friends raised money for a bedsit for him and looked after him in shifts. “Sal had been very distressed when he was sent away from the hospital after his initial diagnosis because he could not pay for his cancer treatment,” said one friend, who was with Saloum on Sunday night when he died.  “Last night, just before he died he became panicked and anxious and I could see he was scared he might be discharged again because he could not pay for his treatment. I knew him for a long time. He was a very brave soul the way he challenged FGM in Gambia. He had a very tough time in the UK because of the labour exploitation and never really had any time to enjoy his life.” After the initial treatment Saloum received a bill from University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS foundation trust for £8,397, which he was unable to pay. The letter stated: “Please be aware that should you require further treatment you will need to pay for this upfront and any care that is not immediately necessary or clinically urgent could be denied.” The Doctors of the World’s director of programmes, Lucy Jones, said: “Sal was let down by the system at every stage and Doctors of the World supported him with over 20 hours of casework to make sure he got the care he needed. Sal should never have been refused help but the current policy meant hospital doctors and the GP didn’t know what to do and were unable to get clarity from the NHS leaving him without any care. “Unfortunately Sal’s case was not isolated; the charging system is distracting medical staff from being able to deliver essential care and causing real harm to patients.” A spokesman for University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS foundation trust said: “We are unable to comment on the care of individual patients due to patient confidentiality.”"
172,cancer,Anti-FGM campaigner denied NHS cancer care,"A campaigner against female genital mutilation who had been diagnosed with terminal cancer was sent away from a Derby hospital because he was not eligible for free NHS care. Saloum, 54, who asked for his surname not to be used, fled the Gambia 10 years ago after risking his life by challenging the government for condoning the widespread use of FGM. Three-quarters of Gambian women aged 15-49 have undergone FGM. After Saloum reached the UK he was subjected to labour exploitation and remained under the radar of the authorities until he collapsed on a Derby street on 27 December last year and was taken to Royal Derby hospital. He was diagnosed with two brain tumours and lung cancer and given just days to live. After being treated at the hospital for several days, Saloum was told that as an undocumented migrant he was not eligible for further NHS treatment unless he could pay for it. He could not and was discharged. Days later, after pressure from the charity Doctors of the World, the hospital indicated it could provide care, but Saloum is currently staying in a small bedsit after friends and members of the local community raised money to pay for accommodation. Saloum’s friends are looking after him in shifts. He is extremely weak, coughs frequently, and while speaking to the Guardian he was drifting in and out of consciousness. On Monday, Saloum received a bill from the hospital for £8,397 for the treatment received before his care was terminated. He cannot pay the bill. “I ran away from my country to come here after I spoke out against FGM,” he said. “I’ve never done anything wrong and I’ve never been in trouble with the police.” He said that until he collapsed he had no idea he was ill. “I had been having headaches and was taking paracetamol,” he said. “When I was in the hospital I was in a coma for three days, I didn’t know what was happening.” One of his friends Fatou, 38, said she was shocked that despite a request for Saloum to be discharged at 6pm to allow people to organise accommodation for him, staff said he had to leave by midday. “It is so inhumane to treat someone with brain tumours and lung cancer in this way,” Fatou said. “We know his condition is terminal. When he was diagnosed in the hospital we were told he only had about five days to live. “It was the way things were handled that was so upsetting. He was told to leave because he could not pay for his care and was not eligible for NHS care. We felt there was no humanity. All we want is for him to receive the treatment he needs to make him comfortable for however long he has left.” Lucy Jones, the director of programmes at Doctors of the World, which is supporting Saloum, said: “We were horrified to hear that a terminally ill patient was discharged from the care of all healthcare professionals and left to fend for himself in the community, causing a great deal of stress at an already devastating time. “… This case shows the hostile environment is alive and well in the NHS, forcing clinical staff to withhold care from dying patients. All doctors and nurses should be able to treat the patient in front of them, not least to ease pain and suffering at the end of their life.” Dr Magnus Harrison, the medical director at University Hospitals of Derby and Burton, said: “We provide care to overseas patients in line with national legislation that outlines which patients are eligible for free NHS treatment. Treatment in NHS emergency departments is free for patients who are not ordinarily resident, although any subsequent treatment as a result of admission to hospital is chargeable.”"
173,cancer,Starwatch: the waxing gibbous moon moves into Cancer," Starwatch chart 11 March 2019 moon waxing gibbous   This week the moon passes through its first quarter phase, when half of the visible surface is illuminated. It occurs on 14 March and marks the moment when the moon stops being a waxing crescent and becomes a waxing gibbous moon. In another week’s time, it will be full. The chart shows the moon’s position in the southern sky on 17 March at 20:00 GMT. Its visible surface will be 85% illuminated and it will be sitting smack in the middle of the faint constellation Cancer, the crab. This is one of the 12 zodiacal constellations, which were some of the first to be defined thousands of years ago. Ironically the bright moon will make it even more difficult to see the faint stars of Cancer but it will mark the constellation’s location in the sky. Remember it. It is well worth being able to identify Cancer because just to the right of the central stars is a prize for naked eye observers: a faint star cluster called the Beehive, or Praesepe. To look for this star cluster, you must be far from city lights as it will only appear as a faint smudge."
174,cancer,Playwright Terrence McNally dies aged 81 of coronavirus complications,"The Tony award-winning playwright Terrence McNally has died at 81. The writer of Kiss of the Spider Woman and Frankie and Johnny was a survivor of lung cancer who lived with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He died of complications from the coronavirus, his spokesman confirmed. McNally’s long career began in 1961 when John Steinbeck asked him to work together on a number of projects, including a musical version of East of Eden. Throughout the 60s, McNally wrote a number of plays, including Noon, Next directed by Elaine May and And Things That Go Bump in the Night, which drew criticism at the time for its gay content. One of his most notable successes came in 1987 with the off-Broadway production of Frankie and Johnny at the Claire de Lune which originally starred Kathy Bates and F Murray Abraham. It was later made into a film starring Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer and made it to Broadway in 2002 picking up a Tony nomination for best revival the following year. McNally’s 1992 musical Kiss of the Spider Woman won him his first of four Tony awards. His other major works included Love! Valour! Compassion!, Master Class and Ragtime. He was awarded the Tony for lifetime achievement in 2019 “To think how reviled my first play was,” McNally said in an interview last year soon after his win. “One review began: ‘The American theater would be a better place this morning if Terrence McNally’s parents had smothered him in his cradle.’ That’s quite a journey, isn’t it?” Tributes have arrived on Twitter from stage luminaries including Lin-Manuel Miranda. “Heartbroken over the loss of Terrence McNally, a giant in our world, who straddled plays and musicals deftly,” he tweeted. “Grateful for his staggering body of work and his unfailing kindness.” Seinfeld actor Jason Alexander tweeted: “I worked for and with Terrence McNally twice in my life and they were two of the greatest experiences I’ve ever had. His work was vital, intense, hysterical and rare. My hope is that he will inspire writers for years to come.” Actor Patrick Wilson, who starred in two shows written by McNally, including The Full Monty, also tweeted: “He had a monumental impact on my career and will be missed.” Chita Rivera, who starred in four of McNally’s shows released the following statement: “A huge part of me is gone. But then it’s not. Terrence wouldn’t like that. He helped to make me who I am as a person. He is the epitome of love and friendship. Only God knows how much I will miss him.” He is survived by his husband, Tom Kirdahy."
175,cancer,Cancer town: civil rights leader William Barber takes on pollution at Guardian town hall,"The US civil rights leader and moral revival campaigner the Rev William Barber has brought his national movement to Louisiana for a series of events on corporate air pollution tied to the Guardian’s year-long series Cancer Town. Barber is appearing at a Guardian-curated town hall event in New Orleans on Friday and will visit Reserve on Saturday morning.   Related: 'Almost every household has someone that has died from cancer'    Residents of the small town face the highest risk of cancer due to airborne toxicity, according to US government science. The pollution is tied to a chemical plant – the only place in America to produce the synthetic rubber neoprene – that emits the compound chloroprene listed by the Environmental Protection Agency as a likely carcinogen. The plant is owned by the Japanese chemical company Denka, which purchased it from DuPont in 2015. Barber, the leader of the Poor People’s Campaign movement and one of the high-profile voices in the Moral Mondays movement, described conditions in Reserve as “tragic … immoral … evil” in an article for the Guardian published earlier this month. You can watch a live stream of events here:              The town hall in New Orleans, at the First Presbyterian church, will feature a roundtable discussion with Robert Taylor, president of the Concerned Citizens of St John; Wilma Subra, a chemist and technical adviser with Louisiana Environmental Action Network; Sharon Lavigne, director of Rise St James; Ruhan Nagra, executive director of the University Network for Human Rights; Larry Sorapuru, councilman-at-large for Saint John Parish; and the Rev Barber. Barber will travel to Saint John Parish on Saturday morning to visit residents of Reserve and observe the Denka plant up close."
176,cancer,HPV vaccine to be given to boys in effort to slash cancer rates,"The NHS will expand the HPV vaccination programme to include all boys in school year 8 in England from September, safeguarding them and girls from a range of cancers. By 2058, which will be the 50th anniversary of the launch of HPV vaccination for girls, Public Health England claims the programme may have prevented more than 100,000 cancers across the UK. Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the cause of most cervical cancers in women. Because the virus is sexually transmitted, vaccinating boys will help protect their partners, but reducing the circulation of the virus, which is linked to 5% of cancers, will also help prevent penile, anal and genital cancers and some cancers of the head and neck. There has been a long campaign to vaccinate boys as well as girls at about the age of 12, and Scotland and Wales have already announced its introduction. Prof Beate Kampmann, the director of the vaccine centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, called the decision “a triumph for gender equality in cancer prevention. “It’s pleasing to see the UK follow the example of other countries like Australia, where the vaccine has been implemented for girls since 2007 and for boys in 2013. This has resulted in the HPV rate among women aged 18 to 24 dropping from 22% to 1% between 2005 and 2015. This success speaks for itself. We now have the tools to eradicate most HPV-associated cancers for men and women.” Robert Music, the chief executive of Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust, named after Jo Maxwell who died of the disease 20 years ago at the age of 40, said the move was “a huge leap forward” for prevention of all cancers caused by the virus. “HPV does not discriminate, it can affect everyone, yet there are still many harmful myths and stigmas surrounding it. This is why a universal vaccination programme is so important, as not only will it normalise this very common virus and reduce existing inequalities, it will protect many more people from developing cancer and save lives,” he said. It was important the uptake of the vaccine remained high, he said. HPV vaccination programmes have struggled in some countries against stigma – because of sexual transmission – and scare stories. Japan suspended vaccination because of fears that it caused pain and fatigue in teenage girls, which was investigated by the European Medicines Agency and discounted. The University of Warwick carried out modelling to establish the likely impact after 50 years, when those vaccinated will have reached the age group when cancer is most common. It predicts that 64,138 HPV-related cervical cancers and 49,649 other HPV-related cancers will be prevented. Recent data suggested that HPV infections could be wiped out in affluent countries within decades. Data by Canadian researchers published in the Lancet showed an 83% reduction in infections in 15- to 19-year-old girls over five to eight years. The World Health Organization has set a goal to cut the number of cases of cervical cancer to no more than four per 100,000 people, below the threshold for a rare disease. Dr Mary Ramsay, the head of immunisation at Public Health England, encouraged parents to take up the offer of vaccination for boys. “This universal programme offers us the opportunity to make HPV-related diseases a thing of the past and build on the success of the girls’ programme,” she said. The public health minister, Seema Kennedy, encouraged everyone eligible to be vaccinated. “Through our world-leading vaccination programme, we have already saved millions of lives and prevented countless cases of terrible diseases. Experts predict that we could be on our way toward eliminating cervical cancer for good,” she said."
177,cancer,NHS England 'on its knees' as performance figures hit new lows,"The NHS was “on its knees” even before winter had begun, health service bosses have said as figures showed it missed key waiting-time targets for A&amp;E care, operations and cancer treatment.  The performance of the NHS in England in November was yet again its worst ever, prompting concern that it cannot keep up with a relentless rise in the number of people needing care.  Doctors’ leaders called for Boris Johnson’s government to take urgent action to boost staffing, hospital bed numbers and GP services. “These figures show an NHS on its knees and it is no wonder that most leaders predict that this winter will be the worst on record,” said Niall Dickson, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation. “More and more patients are turning up at emergency departments and there is a limit as to how many they can cope with.” The latest set of monthly performance figures (pdf) published by NHS England show:  71% of patients who attended a hospital-based A&amp;E unit in November were seen and discharged, admitted or transferred within four hours – a record low. Hospitals were 95% full, far beyond the 85% that doctors consider safe, even before the surge in demand that winter always brings. The highest number of patients ever were forced to spend at least four hours on a hospital trolley waiting for a bed. Thousands of hospital beds are being lost each week due to norovirus, the winter vomiting bug. Flu is already putting serious strain on the NHS, sparking fears of a major outbreak this winter.  The number of people waiting for a non-urgent operation has risen to 4.45 million. The numbers of people seeking help at A&amp;E and being admitted as an emergency case were each at record highs last month. And hospitals managed to meet only three of the eight NHS-wide targets for cancer treatment. “What we are seeing is a health service that is on a downward spiral as this month we see yet another set of shambolic figures,” said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the chair of the British Medical Association.  He blamed the Conservatives for creating the dire situation. “Day one of the new government and another set of stark NHS performance figures. They are not inheriting a problem, they created this problem, and the responsibility ultimately lies with them to fix it.” In recent weeks growing numbers of hospitals have had to declare a black alert – an admission that they cannot cope – as they have been overwhelmed by the number of patients seeking care. “We’ve seen an early spike in flu, while others have been battling norovirus cases, which are already double the levels we saw last year,” said Miriam Deakin, the director of policy and strategy at NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts. "
178,cancer,UK-led cancer and climate trials at risk as British researchers become liability,"British researchers say they are being shut out of bids for major European research partnerships, or asked to keep a low profile, because of fears that the threat of a no-deal Brexit could contaminate chances of success. An analysis by University College London of the latest EU research funding data shows that UCL and eight other Russell Group universities were running around 50 big European research collaborations a year in 2016, but only 20 in 2018. Researchers say that taking a back seat is harmful to prestige, and also means they have less opportunity to steer the direction of research and are likely to have a smaller slice of the funding. Many are voluntarily not leading, however, because they fear that if UK academics are in charge of an important proposal, the research may not be funded. Prof Michael Arthur, president of UCL, says: “What we are seeing is we are still participating in European networks, but we are leading less.” Birmingham University has been asked to step down from leading five bids for training networks, funded by the EU’s Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions, in case a UK partner compromises their chances. The networks are designed to share best practice and teach early career researchers to be more entrepreneurial and creative. Robin Mason, pro vice-chancellor international at Birmingham, says the university’s European partners are, on the whole, being “remarkably forgiving” of the British researchers’ uncertain future, but “patience is wearing thin”. Prof Pamela Kearns, who heads up Cancer Research UK’s national clinical trial centre at the university, is currently sponsoring 16 clinical trials, the majority for childhood cancers, in 21 European countries. She says the political uncertainty is making research partners nervous.   Related: Gender pay gap expert among top professors quitting Brexit Britain    “In one recent discussion about a funding bid with very longstanding European partners, it was decided they wouldn’t have a UK partner on the project as it would be too great a risk,” she says. For the past year Kearns has focused on ensuring she can keep her trials running if Britain crashes out of the EU, but the universities and hospitals involved have voiced concerns. Cancer will be the main theme for health research under the European Commission’s new €100bn (£89.9bn) research funding programme, Horizon Europe, which will succeed the current Horizon 2020 scheme. If Britain crashes out of the EU on 31 October, there is no guarantee it could continue to participate in the programme. “For the UK not to be able to be a partner in a united European approach to making a difference in cancer would be unacceptable,” Kearns says. The head of one leading research university, who wishes to remain anonymous, puts it bluntly: “Leaving with no deal will be a fucking disaster for research. We are already hearing that researchers in the EU are being told ‘Why take the risk of partnering with the UK?’.”  Researchers at LSE’s Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment recently stepped back from leading a new European research network exploring how switching to low-carbon fuels affects countries dependent on coal and oil.   Grapn is falling UK-led research projects   Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the institute, says: “A lot of the other partners are very uncertain about whether our presence in the consortium will stymie the project. Research collaborations only work if you can establish trust. It doesn’t matter how good your reputation is if the UK is seen to be hostile to the outside world.” Peter Cox, professor of climate system dynamics at Exeter University, agrees: “It wouldn’t be right for us to lead on new European research projects at the moment.” Cox says the threat of being shut out of European funding and collaboration if there is no deal is huge. His field of climate prediction has relied on cross-European collaboration for decades, because it is complex and requires local data. Johannes Angermuller, professor of discourse, languages and applied linguistics at the Open University, says the threat of a hard Brexit feels like “a global production chain breaking down” for researchers. Angermuller has had two prestigious European Research Council grants, during which he worked in the UK and at an institution in Paris. However, the French institution may no longer host his future projects because of the threat of a hard Brexit. “I thought I was protected from the storm because I have strong contacts in Europe, but I realise I may be wrong,” he says. “British researchers simply aren’t being asked to participate in bigger projects because of the uncertainty. I haven’t been invited to participate by anyone over the past 12 months. Normally I might have had three or four approaches.”    Related: ‘There’s no plan B’: academics race to safeguard research against Brexit    Lee Cronin, regius professor of chemistry at Glasgow University, says: “I have noticed a big drop in discussions about new grant applications and collaborations, and a drop in researchers who want to come to the UK.” Universities UK (UUK), the vice-chancellors’ body, is lobbying the government to accept the European Commission’s offer for it to continue paying into the EU budget for 2019 and 2020 to ensure stability. This would allow researchers to continue to participate fully in the Horizon 2020 programme. Prof Adrian Smith, vice-chancellor of the University of London, has been commissioned by the government to look into how the UK might set up its own alternative to Horizon Europe in the event of no deal. He is to report to ministers this month, leaving a very small window to have something in place before the exit deadline. Vivienne Stern, director of UUK’s international arm, says: “In a no-deal scenario we would still hope that we could associate with Horizon Europe. But if not, I would be really worried about our ability to create a decent alternative in three months.” “The danger is that we replace it with something new and shiny but trivial in comparison, which may not even replace the financial value and won’t come close to replacing the intangible benefits.”  Prof Philip Stier, Oxford’s head of atmospheric, oceanic and planetary physics, agrees: “Even if there is a replacement UK fund, it is hard to see how you could replace those close collaborations. If you’re not at the table it’s much harder to influence.” Prof Colin Riordan, vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, adds: “One of the biggest arguments in favour of buying into Horizon Europe is continuity. It would make it much easier for universities in the UK to hold on to their best European researchers.”"
179,cancer,Record numbers of NHS cancer patients face 'agonising wait' to see specialist,"Record numbers of cancer patients are waiting longer than they should to see a specialist because NHS services cannot cope with the rise in people suspected of having the disease. In April 19,963 people in England had to wait more than the 14-day maximum to have their first appointment with a cancer specialist – by far the largest number since records began. NHS hospitals are supposed to ensure that 93% of all those referred by their GP for suspected cancer see a specialist within a fortnight. But April was also the first time since the target was introduced in October 2009 that fewer than 90% did so. Performance was just 89.9% – the worst ever. “When someone is first diagnosed or hears the words ‘we think it could be cancer’, their world often turns upside down in a single moment. The wait to see a specialist or to start treatment is an agonising time already, and facing further delays can make things even worse”, said Kate Goldie, a senior cancer information nurse specialist at Macmillan Cancer Support. “Those affected experience worry and uncertainty cannot go about their daily lives, while relatives are left feeling helpless,” she added. NHS England data show that hospital trusts have failed to meet the 93% target in 10 of the last 12 months amid growing demand on, and serious staff shortages, in cancer services. Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s shadow health secretary, said: “It’s disgraceful that suspected cancer patients aren’t being seen on time, especially as we know that early diagnosis leads to better outcomes.” In addition, two-thirds (66%) of trusts failed in April to ensure that the required 85% of cancer patients referred for urgent treatment within 62 days did start their care on time.   Related: Every Tory MP sent This Is Going to Hurt as reminder of Jeremy Hunt's record    Another grim batch of NHS monthly performance statistics also showed that the waiting list of people referred for non-urgent care in hospital is the biggest on record at 4.3 million and that just 86% are treated within 18 weeks, even though it should be 92%. “The latest set of NHS figures show a health service descending into an ever-deepening crisis and closer to a system unfit for purpose. Hospital, general practice and community services are struggling to cope”, said Dr Rob Harwood, chair of the consultants committee at the British Medical Association, the doctors’ union. The only good news was that staff vacancies have fallen from 102,000 to 96,000. However, the number of unfilled posts in nursing is rising. Separate figures released by NHS Improvement (NHSI) revealed that England’s 240 NHS trusts now owe a staggering £14bn to the government for emergency loans they have taken out to pay their running costs. Experts said the total – by far the highest ever and up from £11bn last year – showed that years of under-funding during 2010 to 2019 had left the NHS unable to function within the budgets it had been given. The £14bn is the sum total of bailouts that the Department of Health and Social Care has given trusts in recent years when they have hit serious financial problems, so they can continue to pay their staff and bills. “The rapid growth in debt to the Department of Health is driven by the need for emergency loans from the department to pay the bills trusts aren’t able to put off: wages to staff and vital supplies. The scale of such loans is now so significant that in 2017 trusts owed more to the DH than they did to PFI companies”, said Sally Gainsbury, a senior policy analyst at the Nuffield Trust health thinktank. While trusts recorded a combined deficit of £571m in 2018-19, down from £966m the year before, NHSI also admitted that the health service’s underlying deficit worsened from £4.3bn last year to £5bn. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS providers, which represents trusts, said trusts had put in “a strong financial performance” and improved the quality of care last year, given the huge pressures on hospitals. • This article was amended on 15 June 2019 to clarify that the 93% waiting time target is to see a specialist, not an oncologist specifically as stated in an earlier version."

181,cancer,U-turn over plans to privatise cancer scanning services,"NHS bosses have made a significant U-turn over plans to privatise cancer scanning services after outcry from MPs, doctors and patients. The rethink means the two scanners used for the tests at the cancer centre at the Churchill hospital in Oxford will remain there, after the new private contractor was forced to drop plans to move them elsewhere. In a further act of backtracking, the NHS staff who operate the PET-CT scans at the hospital will continue to do so. Personnel from InHealth, the firm handed the contract to run the service by NHS England, will have no role at the Churchill. Positron emission tomography and computed tomography play a vital role in diagnosing cancer and helping to track the growth of tumours and, therefore, help to determine the treatment a patient receives. The two changes represent a significant retreat by NHS England and InHealth and follow warnings that ending PET-CT scanning at the Churchill would be “a disaster” for patient care. Under InHealth’s original plan, people with cancer being treated as inpatients at the Churchill would have been taken by ambulance to have a PET-CT scan at GenesisCare private cancer clinic at Littlemore, its intended site for the scanners four miles away on the outskirts of Oxford. NHS England’s reversal comes after sustained opposition against switching the contract from the NHS to InHealth. Scores of cancer patients had opposed the plan and Oxfordshire MPs from all three main parties had voiced unease, particularly about the scanners leaving the Churchill. Anneliese Dodds, the Labour MP for Oxford East, in which the hospital is situated, said: “I am pleased that NHS England has backtracked and that the scanners will remain in Churchill hospital and be operated by NHS staff. “What we have seen from the response to this case is that the public is acutely aware that the NHS is best placed to provide the quality care they need. I have received a large amount of correspondence from constituents concerned about this matter.” NHS England’s rethink emerged in papers  submitted by both NHS England and Oxford University Hospital NHS foundation trust, which runs the Churchill, to the meeting of Oxfordshire county council’s health oversight and scrutiny committee scheduled for 4 April. In its paper, NHS England confirmed that InHealth had dropped its plan to relocate the scanners to Littlemore after OUH’s bosses, governors and doctors warned it would hit the quality and safety of patient care. The changes, it said, meant there was “no impact” of the privatisation for the people of Oxford. NHS England sought to reassure critics who questioned the contractor’s lack of experience in providing such a vital service, saying: “The InHealth service will be led by an experienced PET-CT doctor who holds an Administration of Radioactive Substances Advisory Committee (ARSAC) license and who will have managerial responsibility for delivery of all aspects of the service.” OUH welcomed the U-turn on how PET-CT scanning would operate in Oxford, even though InHealth was still getting the contract. Dame Fiona Caldicott, the trust’s chairwoman, said: “We believe that it is in the best interests of patients living with cancer in Oxford and the surrounding areas for the current PET-CT service at the Chuchill hospital to be retained and for it to continue to be run by OUH clinicians. “This is an agreement in principle at this stage, but it is a step in the right direction which we welcome.” InHealth’s contract is to provide PET-CT scanning for the entire Thames Valley for at least seven, and possibly 10, years. It will set up new PET-CT services in Swindon and Milton Keynes as part of the deal to help improve patients’ access to such scans. An NHS England spokesperson said: “We are pleased that Oxford University Hospitals NHS foundation trust and InHealth have agreed to work together. This means PET-CT services will continue at the Churchill hospital, but also it will enable new local services to open in Milton Keynes and Swindon so that NHS patients there can get a far more convenient local service.”"
182,cancer,I'm an NHS junior doctor: here's why I'm asking you to stay at home,"I’m a junior doctor, in my second year of work. As luck would have it, Covid-19 has caught me in my A&amp;E rotation at a busy central London hospital. As the pandemic began to develop, we would receive daily guidance from Public Health England (PHE) on whom we should swab and what kind of isolation advice to give. Initially, we were swabbing people with significant travel history and respiratory symptoms. The numbers climbed: 20, 30, 150, 450, 1,000 … By 10 March, the reality of community transmissions was apparent. The question of travel history became irrelevant.    The problem is that even with more ventilators, we need staff trained to operate them and look after ventilated patients    Now, we only swab people sick enough to come into hospital, which means we’ll have a falsely low number of confirmed cases. Meanwhile, the government continues to downgrade the quality of personal protective equipment (PPE) worn by NHS staff. Initially, we were wearing FFP3s, high-grade masks filtering out 99% of particles smaller than 0.6 microns, to see any patient with suspected Covid-19. Pretty quickly, demand exceeded supply. Suddenly, entire wards were set up purely for Covid-19 patients. On 11 March, we were informed there wasn’t sufficient evidence supporting the wearing of FFP3s. Instead, PHE advised “basic respiratory precautions”, like with flu. Now we are wearing the most basic surgical masks and a tissue-thin plastic apron to see entire wards of confirmed cases. This is a terrifying decision. The most basic epidemiology shows coronavirus is a lot more infectious than flu and, with the virus spreading like wildfire in the community, surely we should be taking every precaution to stop its spread within the hospital? By not providing healthcare workers with adequate protection, not only is the government endangering the people at the frontline, they are putting at risk the vulnerable, frail inpatients who may catch it from an asymptomatic doctor, nurse, porter or cleaner. As for the actual situation within hospitals, we’ve had to use the cancer ward, where every room is a side room; the “suspected Covids” coming in from A&amp;E need to be isolated pending swab results. Once confirmed negative, patients are stepped down to a normal ward. This strategy is sensible but poses its own problems. First, cancer patients were put in side rooms for a reason. They’re often immunocompromised and thus need to be isolated for their own protection. Part of the collateral damage of Covid-19 is these vulnerable patients are now in open bays, sitting ducks for infection. What does Covid-19 itself look like? I see an average of six to eight probable cases a night, and end up admitting one to two of them. And that’s just one A&amp;E doctor. The clinical picture is invariably the same: cough, high fevers, generalised muscle ache with progressive difficulty in breathing. By the time they’re brought in by ambulance, they are severely oxygen-deprived. Chest X-rays show bilateral infiltrates with such a distinctive appearance that we can now recognise it at a glance. The ICU admissions have truly horrendous chest X-rays and require intubation. So far, about half to three-quarters of our ICU is Covid-19; across the UK, at time of writing, there have been 144 deaths.   Related: South Korea took rapid, intrusive measures against Covid-19 – and they worked | Alexis Dudden and Andrew Marks    The strain that Covid-19 is placing on the healthcare system is immense. All elective surgeries have been cancelled. Doctors are being moved to high-pressure areas such as A&amp;E and general medicine. Anyone with experience of ICU and intubation is being redeployed back to ICU, where it is anticipated the numbers requiring ventilation will rise sharply over the next week. The government is frantically trying to source more ventilators. The problem is that even with more ventilators, we need staff trained to operate them and look after ventilated patients. A tall order, given the NHS in England is short of 10,000 doctors and 40,000 nurses. So, please stay at home if you can, avoid unnecessary social contact, keep washing your hands and practise good basic hygiene. Stop stockpiling unnecessarily. Think of the frail and vulnerable the next time you go and clear out a whole shelf of food you won’t need. Think of them when you venture outside when you have symptoms. Whether we like it or not, we’re all in this together. • Catherine Hsu is a second-year junior doctor in the NHS"
183,cancer,"Causes of cancer may leave 'fingerprints' in DNA, scientists say","From smoking to alcohol, air pollution to sunlight, a host of factors in our environment can cause cancer. Now scientists say they might be able to pinpoint the culprits for individual tumours. Experts say they have managed to link particular environmental triggers with specific genetic mutations that give rise to cancer, opening up the possibility that researchers could look for clues in a tumour to deduce what triggered its formation. “Mutational signatures are the fingerprints that carcinogens leave behind on our DNA and, just like fingerprints, each one is unique,” said Dr Serena Nik-Zainal, of the Medical Research Council cancer unit at Cambridge University, who co-led the research. “They allow us to treat tumours as a crime scene and, like forensic scientists, allow us to identify the culprit, and their accomplices, responsible for the tumour.” Cancers develop as a result of changes to the DNA within cells. These changes – or mutations – can affect the way the cells divide and the growth of tissue, producing tumours. According to the latest figures, one in two people will develop cancer in their lifetime. Writing in the journal Cell, researchers from the UK report how they exposed human stem cells, produced from skin cells, to 79 different chemicals or processes that are believed to cause cancer including solar radiation, various chemotherapy drugs and a host of substances found in tobacco smoke.   Related: Could we soon be able to detect cancer in 10 minutes?    Overall, the team found 41 of these – or 52% of the agents – produced distinct genetic changes that could be spotted in cells, with some producing more than one hallmark. The team then compared these signatures with mutations seen in human cancers. “We’ve used this technique to create the most comprehensive catalogue to date of the patterns of DNA damage produced by environmental agents across the whole human genome,” said Prof David Phillips of King’s College London. “It should allow us to examine a patient’s tumour and identify some of the carcinogens they have been exposed to that may have caused the cancer.” The team found that the artificial sun produced a similar set of mutations to those seen in UV-associated cancers, while genetic signatures were also seen for a range of substances found in tobacco smoke, with these similar to those seen in lung cancers associated with smoking. They also found genetic changes produced by the chemotherapy drugs cisplatin and carboplatin were consistent with those seen in myeloid tumors that developed in people who had undergone chemotherapy. Nik-Zainal said: “Our reference library will allow doctors in future to identify those culprits responsible for causing cancer. Such information could be invaluable in helping inform measures to reduce people’s exposure to potentially dangerous carcinogens.” While the team said the approach could also flag previously unknown causes of cancer, they urged caution, noting it could also lead to the suggestion of exposure to a substance which has not actually been encountered. “This is important to stress as it may have important legal implications for industries where some of these agents may be occupational exposures,” they wrote."
184,cancer,New breast cancer treatment offers hope of longer life to younger women,"Younger women with breast cancer have been given the hope of living longer after what is described as “one of the greatest advances in breast cancer research in recent decades”. Adding ribociclib, a targeted drug that disrupts cancer cells, to standard hormone therapy was found to boost survival among premenopausal patients who have an advanced form of the disease. The risk of death was cut by almost a third compared with those treated with hormone therapy alone, according to the study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s annual meeting in Chicago. “This is indescribably good news for patients and their families,” said Lady Delyth Morgan, the chief executive at Breast Cancer Care and Breast Cancer Now. The research, led by Dr Sara Hurvitz of the University of California in Los Angeles, followed 672 pre-menopausal women under the age of 59 who had advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. The patients were assigned either ribociclib, which targets and interferes with processes in the cells that cause cancer to grow, or a placebo. All the women also received hormone therapy. After 42 months, 70% of those treated with the combination therapy were still alive, compared with 46% of those who received just hormone therapy. “This is the first study to show improved survival for any targeted therapy when used with endocrine therapy as a first-line treatment for advanced breast cancer,” Hurvitz said. “The use of ribociclib as a frontline therapy significantly prolonged overall survival, which is good news for women with this terrible disease.”   Related: I was 31 when I was diagnosed with breast cancer – it cost me so much | Becca Leaver    Women who received ribociclib lived an average of 23.8 months without the disease progressing, compared with 13 months for those treated with a placebo, the research found. “We have known for some time that giving ribociclib with an aromatase inhibitor [a hormone therapy] can slow the spread of incurable breast cancer, but to now know that it can also extend life for premenopausal patients is the new hope that so many families have been waiting for,” Delyth said. “The recent introduction of this class of drugs to NHS care has offered a long-awaited step forward in our ability to delay the progression of the most common type of incurable breast cancer. It is now absolutely fantastic to see the very first evidence that ribociclib can give thousands of younger women diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer more time to live. We cannot put into words what it will mean for so many women to be able to spend precious extra time with their families and create memories that will last a lifetime. “This class of drugs, and the way it slows cancer growth, represents one of the greatest advances in breast cancer research in recent decades, and it’s vital we ensure that all patients who could benefit are able to access it.” The study may also stimulate further research into whether the combination of ribociclib and other types of drug that are currently not approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence could help another class of breast cancer patients – those who have received prior hormone therapy."
185,cancer,Families seek answers for US rise in childhood cancers,"Soccer was a huge passion in Oliver Strong’s young life. Right up to his death from acute myeloid leukemia in June 2015 at the age of 12, he was a standout athlete and goalkeeper, a healthy, vibrant and popular boy with a zest for living that inspired his teammates, friends and family. So when Oliver died suddenly at a Miami children’s hospital, just 36 hours after doctors first diagnosed the disease, his parents Simon and Vilma started looking for answers. What they found was disturbing. Cases of pediatric cancer in the United States surged by almost 50% from 1975 to 2015, according to alarming but under-reported statistics by the National Cancer Institute, and in 2018 up to 16,000 children from birth to age 19 will have received a new diagnosis. Yet what really elevated the disquiet of Oliver’s parents was increasing concern over the role that carcinogenic environmental toxicants, including industrial waste and pollutants, were believed to be playing in the rise of childhood cancer. “There’s almost an unspoken scientific consensus that it’s always environmental,” said Simon Strong, who with his wife set up Oliver Forever Strong – a foundation in their son’s memory. Oliver’s Forever Strong has now teamed up for an ambitious research study with scientists at the Texas Children’s Hospital, home to the nation’s largest pediatric cancer center, and the Baylor College of Medicine.     Simon Strong and Vilma Tarazona Strong lost their 12-year-old son, Oliver to pediatric cancer four years ago. Oliver’s parents have kept his room intact in their home in Miami Beach, Florida. Photograph: Maria Alejandra Cardona/The Guardian    Through the website thereasonswhy.us, the study will harness social media to help collate information from a wide geographical spread. Families with their own experiences of childhood cancers will sign up and receive a questionnaire in the coming months seeking information including the manifestation and progression of their cancers as well as demographics. Dr Michael Scheurer, director of the childhood cancer epidemiology and prevention program at Texas Children’s Hospital, said: “[This research] … will allow families who might not live near one of the existing study centers to participate as they are comfortable. “We realize individuals won’t know if they’ve been exposed to a certain chemical or specific agent so we try to gather an overview of their environment, where have they lived over the course of time, when the child was conceived, during mom’s pregnancy, during early childhood, up to the point they developed their cancer. Are those residences located near Superfund sites, or in areas with high levels of air pollution or water contaminants? “In the end, if we see that several kinds of cancers share some risk factors that’s important information, but we want to start with a very homogeneous group of cancers and start looking into these patients first. Signposts will pop up along the way.”     Oliver’s parents have kept his room intact in their home in Miami Beach Photograph: Maria Alejandra Cardona/The Guardian    Environmental factors Strong says the hope is to eventually build a more detailed picture of the correlation between toxicants and childhood cancer. “I, like most people, thought it’s just bad luck and dodgy genes, and you discover we’re quietly encouraged to think that,” he said. “[But] I found a paper published by the World Health Organization … it’s always triggered by external agents that damage our DNA and the body’s ability to deal with that damage.” In his own son’s case, Strong admits to second guessing events in the months and weeks leading up to Oliver’s death, which came after a week of headaches. Strong says he has no idea if it was any kind of factor in his son’s death but that he regrets using Roundup on their patio to get rid of weeds. “Oliver’s brother Edward said they both hated the smell of that stuff. [On one occasion] I looked at the container and saw glyphosate, and looked that up and saw it was declared a probable human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. “And we all know now about the jury verdicts regarding glyphosate [three juries in the US have awarded damages linking the weed killer to cancer; Bayer its manufacturer insists it is safe and is appealing].    Related: US playgrounds: fears grow over health risks from rubber particles    Strong said someone had also told him about artificial turf and “the role it might be having in an apparently high level of childhood cancer”. He said: “Look at the turf and the black spongy stuff that’s in it. It’s mostly diced up, used vehicle tires, it’s petrochemical stuff. There are strict regulations for the disposition of full vehicle tires, but nothing when it comes to dicing them up and using them as a spongy surface for athletes to play on. “So I’d been exposing Oliver to Roundup, he’d been playing for six months as a goalkeeper on this stuff. I have no clue whether either contributed, but he was exposed to these two things and if I’d known better, I would have not exposed him.” On a wider scale, Strong started looking at incidences and clusters of childhood cancer nationwide, and possible environmental factors behind them, which led to the foundation launching the thereasonswhy.us project. “The International Agency for Research on Cancer’s raison d’etre is studying carcinogens in our environment, but in our health industry the focus is purely on detection, diagnosis and treatment, because that’s where the money is … and not focusing on prevention,” he said.     Simon Strong and Vilma Tarazona Strong lost their 12-year-old son, Oliver to pediatric cancer four years ago. Photograph: Maria Alejandra Cardona/The Guardian    Cancer research funding cut by government Privately-funded research will likely increase in importance as federal funding falls for tackling pediatric cancer, the leading cause of death in the US for children past infancy. In February, Donald Trump announced a $500m appropriation over 10 years, compared to a seven-year, $1.8bn investment under Barack Obama. The president has also slashed environmental protections that Strong says has contributed to the “emasculation” of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). There are tens of thousands of synthetic chemicals registered by the EPA but only a small proportion tested for toxicity, Strong says. “It’s in our foods, packaging and clothing, building materials, cleaning products, cosmetics, toys and baby bottles. And even less is known about the effects of simultaneous exposure to multiple chemicals. “There are hundreds of communities across the country where people are raising their voices. In Otsego, Michigan, they had an extremely high number of pediatric cancer cases and managed to get the EPA to conduct air, water and soil studies. In most communities it relates to pollution as a result of toxic waste from active or defunct manufacturing plants of one kind or another, as well as run-off nutrients from farming operations. “There’s a similar story in Franklin, Indiana. You have all these communities which are increasingly active on social media, coming into contact with each other and saying, ‘Hey, you too?’ Previously they were operating as pockets and wouldn’t have heard of each other. That’s where we are stepping in. We’re going to be bringing together many of those communities.” Ultimately, Strong hopes to enlist thousands of families for the study, with the first 200 signed up by the middle of the summer. The questionnaire should be ready for distribution before the end of the year, and he said he had already signed up participants from almost half of the 50 states plus some in South America. “Oliver was a compassionate, empathetic soul with a strong sense of justice, so I’d like to think we are doing this in his spirit, and at the same time it’s important for me that this not be about Oliver, it’s about all families who are affected by childhood cancer,” he said. “We want society to be invested not in sickness but in health … celebrating young people preserving their health because we live in an environment with safer water, safer air and safer products.”"
186,cancer,Inspired touch: how blind women outdo doctors at finding breast cancer,"As a child, Francia Papamija started progressively losing her eyesight due to a retinal detachment. Today, everything is darkness for the 36-year-old – except for the job she holds in a clinic in Cali, Colombia, where she contributes to the early detection of breast cancer. Papamija is a medical tactile examiner (MTE), a role created especially for women who are blind and have higher sensitivity in their fingertips. According to Dr Frank Hoffmann, a gynaecologist, who created Discovering Hands to improve early detection, visually impaired women can detect about 30% more tissue alterations than doctors. Moreover, those changes can be 50% smaller than those usually identified by medics. Papamija sees about 10 women a day in her consulting room at La Rivera health centre. She believes it’s easier for her as a blind woman to create a more relaxed atmosphere with patients “because they feel less nervous to talk openly about sensitive issues”. Using her fingertips, Papamija explores a woman’s breasts, underarms and neck during a 45-minute examination. She is guided by five adhesive strips marked in braille, so wherever she finds a lump she can report to the doctor its exact location. No centimetre will be ignored. If she detects any lumps, Papamija will arrange an appointment with the doctor – she doesn’t make a diagnosis - to arrange more tests.  Papamija is one of three visually impaired women who have been working as MTEs across several health centres in Cali, in Colombia’s south-west, for the past two years. Training to become a professional examiner takes nine months. They are currently the only MTEs in the country, where their work is supported by the Development Bank of Latin America. Mexico recently launched a similar scheme.     Francia Papamija examines the breast of a patient at La Rivera health centre. Photograph: Elena del Estal    “They [MTEs] have this gift in their fingers. If they are trained, their disability can become a talent, a strength, and can be used for helping other people,” says Dr Luis Alberto Olave, the surgeon who coordinates the project. “Nodules are the first cancer symptom. The faster we find them, the faster we will have any impact on the projection of the illness, and that may mean saving lives.” Globally, more than 2 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year, according to the World Health Organization. In 2018, 627,000 women died. In Colombia more than 8,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Experts say death rates from the disease are rising, because many new cases are diagnosed too late. “Our breast cancer rates are not so high as in developed countries but we have a huge disadvantage: we are failing on early detection,” says Olave, who wants the MTE programme to be rolled out countrywide. Preventive mammography is still the best screening method, but it is expensive and only offered to women over 50, even though cases of breast cancer in younger women are growing. “The exhaustive scans performed by blind examiners are available to all women who come for the pap test and those are not replacing mammograms, they are only supplementary,” says Paubla Lucumi, chief nurse of the breast cancer programme at La Rivera. “Although many women come without any symptom, these tests serve a useful educational purpose as here girls begin to learn about how important self-care is around breast cancer.”     Leidy Garica calls her next patient into her consulting room in the Meléndez health centre in Cali. Photograph: Elena del Estal    Every day the Meléndez clinic in southern Cali is full of women waiting to be seen by Leidy Garcia, 27, a visually impaired examiner who has examined more than 2,500 patients. After suffering a cerebral thrombosis eight years ago, she can no longer see through her left eye and is only able to make out blurred shapes through the right one. Losing her sight was traumatic, says Garcia, but working as an MTE has been empowering: “This job gives me huge self-confidence. Now I feel free, independent and useful. I can contribute to the community.   Related: How breast ironing is spreading in the UK    “For people with disabilities, it’s so hard to find a job because of bias and boundaries inside companies, so this is a great opportunity based in our talent. It’s also a good way to change the mindset of society, which usually patronises blind people, thinking we are not able to do many things,” she says. Garcia believes that because of her work people now see her for what she does, not for what she lacks. She appreciates how this has started to change in her own patients, such as Maria*, who did not hesitate when her gynaecologist offered her a breast examination by an MTE. “Her blindness is not a problem: every single person has abilities. It doesn’t matter which disabilities she has. If she knows how to do this, and she does even better, is great for all of us.” *Name has been changed This story is part of the project “A Light in Darkness”, funded by the European Journalism Centre via its Innovation in Development reporting grant programme"
187,cancer,UK councils assess weedkiller use after US cancer court case,"Councils from Wirral to Norwich are looking to phase out the use of chemical weedkillers on playgrounds, parks and pavements after a US court ordered the manufacturer of the bestselling brand Roundup to pay one user $80m (£61m) in damages after he developed cancer. Hampshire county council said it was re-examining its use of glyphosate herbicides, the London borough of Richmond is to begin trials of non-chemical weed removal next week, and Trafford borough council last month voted to phase out the use of all pesticides and weedkillers on council land, and scrap glyphosate treatments within a year on all but the most stubborn weeds. The action comes after a US federal jury in Santa Rosa, California, ruled that the manufacturer of Roundup, Monsanto, was liable for the non-Hodgkin lymphoma suffered by Edwin Hardeman. Hardeman testified that he had sprayed the herbicide for nearly three decades before he was diagnosed with cancer. Last week’s ruling was the second major legal blow to Monsanto’s owner, Bayer. In November, Dewayne Johnson, a 46-year-old former groundskeeper with terminal cancer, was awarded $79m by a San Francisco judge after a jury ruled the company was responsible for “negligent failure” and knew or should have known that its product was “dangerous”.     Two civil cases in the US have centred on cancers allegedly caused by the Monsanto product Roundup. Photograph: Haven Daley/AP    Shares in Bayer sunk to their lowest price in almost seven years after the Hardeman verdict. A third trial began in Oakland on 28 March. Alva Pilliod and his wife, Alberta, both in their 70s, have non-Hodgkin lymphoma after using Roundup. They are suing Monsanto claiming that the company had known for two decades that Roundup could cause the disease. Bayer denies the claims, citing “four decades of extensive science and the conclusions of regulators worldwide that support the safety of our glyphosate-based herbicides and that they are not carcinogenic”. It is appealing against the two verdicts. The cases have caused growing concern in UK town halls where glyphosate products have been widely used. A spokesperson for Hampshire county council told the Guardian: “In the light of this ruling, we are looking into the implications of HCC’s use of glyphosate-based weedkillers. Given their widespread use nationally, we also await and expect further guidance from central government.” Current government advice describes glyphosate as an important chemical for use in agriculture and transport and it is approved for use in the UK until 2022. However, the evidence is under review. Wirral, which currently uses glyphosate on kerbs and pavements, and to control weeds on the footpaths of Hoylake beach, said it was “seeking ways to minimise the use of glyphosate for the future, by researching alternative weed treatments including non-chemical approaches”. Some alternatives have already been ruled out in parts of the country. Vinegar is often considered too smelly, boiling water is too dangerous for some and mini flame-throwers raise concerns about insurance coverage. Trafford will still use glyphosate on the toughest weeds, including Japanese knotweed. Support for glyphosate is being led by the Amenity Forum, a group whose members include Monsanto and its parent company, Bayer, which both help fund the organisation and have written advice articles for its newsletter. At least one council, West Lothian in Scotland, decided to continue using glyphosate on the forum’s advice. In 2016 it told concerned petitioners: “We have continued to use it, based on information provided by the Amenity Forum, who are a non-profit-making, independent body.” Monsanto has also employed Red Flag, a Dublin-based lobbyist, which was last year revealed by Greenpeace to have been the administrator of a campaign by farmers in the UK and other European countries defending the use of glyphosate. Red Flag’s chief executive, Karl Brophy, said at the time that it was to oppose an activist-led campaign to ban glyphosate, which he said was “flying in the face of science, the position of all relevant EU regulatory agencies and the position of the European commission”. John Moverley, chairman of the Amenity Forum, said the group was currently running events around the country to advance its case that glyphosates are safe and cheaper than the alternatives. “If [councils do switch], fine, but they need to alert their residents that the costs of managing the weeds will significantly increase,” he said."
188,cancer,Chemical companies at centre of Guardian's Cancer Town series face state legal action,"Louisiana’s environment agency is poised to sue the two chemical companies associated with America’s only neoprene plant in the town of Reserve, the Guardian has learned. The legal action relates to alleged violations of the Clean Air Act and Louisiana state environmental laws. 
The news comes a month after the Guardian launched a year-long reporting project from Reserve, called Cancer Town, that tracks residents’ struggle for clean air and reports from other parts of the New Orleans-Baton Rouge corridor known colloquially as Cancer Alley.

The move, quietly announced in a letter from the state’s department of environmental quality (LDEQ) to Louisiana’s attorney general, represents a significant and rare escalation in the state’s response to air pollution in Reserve. According to US government science, the town has the highest risk of cancer due to airborne toxicity anywhere in America. 
The letter, dated 5 June, is written by LDEQ’S general counsel, Herman Robinson, and requests “concurrence to file a civil action” in federal court against Japanese neoprene firm Denka and American chemicals giant DuPont. In a response on 7 June, shared with the Guardian, Louisiana attorney general Jeff Landry agreed, calling a suit the “best course of action”. 
Denka is the current operator of the neoprene unit at the Pontchartrain Works facility in Reserve, which it purchased in 2015 from DuPont, who had operated the site since the 1960s. 
Neoprene, a synthetic rubber, is primarily made of the compound chloroprene, which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says is likely to be carcinogenic to humans. Chloroprene emissions around Reserve have routinely been dozens of times above the EPA’s recommended guidance that is safe for humans prompting recent outcry from residents living close to the plant. 
LDEQ’s said it would not comment on pending legal matters.  
Denka also told the Guardian it would not comment on pending litigation, citing the advice of counsel. 
Marylee Orr, director of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network (Lean), said that for the agency to potentially file suit “against a major industry in Louisiana’s pro-business climate is no small feat”. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
She said: “Hopefully this is a step towards relief for a community that has endured 50 years of hazardous exposure to a likely carcinogen.” 
Although the precise details of the requested lawsuit are unclear, LDEQ had warned Denka last month that readings of chloroprene had not fallen below the agreed standards set in a voluntary agreement back in 2017. That agreement committed the firm to reducing chloroprene emissions by 85% by 2018. The possible suit comes amid reports of rankling between LDEQ and local government over the failures to meet emission reduction targets. 
Hugh Lambert, a lead attorney in a lawsuit filed against Denka and DuPont by a number of residents in Reserve, urged the Louisiana attorney general, Jeffery Landry, to act on the LDEQ request. 
“Hopefully politics doesn’t get in the way of this health and environmental issue that should have nothing to do with politics. If the attorney general does his job, he will approve this LDEQ request and OK the filing of a suit against Denka. That ought to happen,” Lambert said. 
A representative for DuPont did not respond to specific questions on the potential litigation but said the company continued “to uphold our commitment to safe operations for our workers and neighbors”. 
The representative insisted that DuPont met chloroprene emissions limits in its state permit before sale of the neoprene unit to Denka."
189,cancer,"As the NHS pivots to coronavirus, what about its other patients?","As a prostate cancer surgeon, my life before coronavirus was pretty predictable. Each day I’d go to work and either operate on patients with prostate cancer, see patients with a new diagnosis of prostate cancer to discuss surgery, or check in with patients after I’d operated on them to monitor their recovery. Now, my working days are chaotic and unpredictable. Some hospitals are already overloaded with coronavirus admissions. Others, like University College London Hospitals, where I work, are busy making space for the impending outbreak. At UCLH, cancellations of elective cases have given doctors more time to help Covid-19 patients. Anaesthetists have tried to hold off using respirators for these patients until absolutely necessary, preferring less invasive methods instead. This has used fewer resources and freed up anaesthetists and intensive care nurses who would otherwise be managing incubated patients. Our strategy appears to be working, at least for now. What is less clear is how we will prevent death and disability from other non-viral conditions during the outbreak. Though some would be forgiven for assuming coronavirus is now the only disease, the NHS still has to deal with myriad other illnesses alongside the pandemic. What will happen to patients with cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other medical conditions that still need managing? For these patients, the knock-on effects of coronavirus could be devastating. A patient with end-stage cancer, who needs chemotherapy that could extend their life by a few months, may no longer get this treatment – as the chemotherapy could make them more susceptible to coronavirus. Oncologists have informed me that the decisions facing their patients amount to Hobson’s choice – without chemotherapy, patients will likely die more quickly from their cancer, but they will still be less likely to die than if they contracted coronavirus while undergoing chemotherapy. And what about the cancer patients with better prospects - those who could have an operation and be “cured”? In the current viral climate, these patients are now deemed not “time critical” enough to warrant their operations. They may remain stuck in a “holding pattern”, rather like flights not yet cleared for landing. They risk their cancers progressing – possibly even to an incurable state. And while these risks may be low, it’s a lottery no patient wants to play.   Related: What scientists know so far about the effects of coronavirus on children | Jonathan Ball    When this is all over, when the NHS has defeated this virus, when children are back to school, shops are reopened and cities are no longer under lockdown, what will happen to the countless people who are still waiting for treatment? How does a previously overstretched NHS cope with managing these patients, in addition to those who will present with cancer and other non-viral illnesses during the coronavirus outbreak? The NHS will face one of the steepest backlogs of cases in its history. To stem this backlog and ensure patients get the treatment they need, we should consider redistributing current resources to create hubs where oncologists and cancer surgeons could treat their urgent patients. Rather than basing the clinical priority of these patients on NHS waiting targets, as has historically been the case, these doctors could instead triage patients according to the severity and risks of their disease. Though much of our focus now is rightly on coronavirus deaths, we risk losing sight of another wave of tragic fatalities – those who didn’t have coronavirus, but didn’t get the treatment they needed during this urgent crisis. • Prasanna Sooriakumaran is a consultant urological surgeon at University College London Hospital "
190,cancer,"War in the Blood review – love, hope and the search for a cancer cure","Martin Pule spent his childhood dismantling radios, computers and any other devices he came across, reassembling them in alternative ways and pressing them into new services. Even allowing for childish curiosity, it speaks to a different way of conceptualising the world – as a miscellany of parts, only temporarily constituted in their current forms. Most of us are just pleased to come across a device already disposed to work. War in the Blood (BBC Two) was about what happens when such a child grows up, becomes a doctor and turns that mindset towards the human body. “I realised that cells are machines you might take apart, and genetic code is not really that dissimilar to computer programmes.” Now at the University College London’s Cancer Institute, he became a pioneer of CAR T-cell therapy. As he explains it to the viewer, with the unhurried simplicity of someone with knowledge to share and nothing to prove, this is the process of taking a leukaemia patient’s or a donor’s T-cells (the mainstay of our immune systems; they hunt and kill cells infected with viruses) and inserting into them a piece of DNA that teaches them to recognise cancer cells, which they would otherwise ignore, and treat them with the same lethal force they do viruses. Then they return the T-cells to the patient and … well, you hope for the best. The therapy has recently started phase-one trials – the first tests on humans. The subjects must be terminally ill patients who have run out of treatment options and are willing to undergo the intervention knowing that, of course, it may not work. So far, however, the research suggests that the approach may eventually become a cure for all cancers. The programme follows two such patients: middle-aged former military man Graham Threader, who was diagnosed with leukaemia in August 2015, and 18-year-old Mahmoud Kayiizi, who has relapsed with the same disease after several rounds of treatment and a bone marrow transplant. Mahmoud looks both younger and much older than his years. “I just want to live,” he says from his hospital bed with a literally bone-deep weariness. “It would be heartbreaking for my mum …” Graham will be treated with his brother’s donated cells, Mahmoud with his own, both weaponised in Dr Pule’s laboratory and administered by a team led by Dr Claire Roddie. It is a film about love, hope and the tempering of both with realism. Doctors must do it with patients, being careful neither to fan the flames of optimism with their knowledge of the studies coming out of the US (which has more data on the therapy than we do) or douse them with their appreciation of how long any path to any cure must be. At one point, Mahmoud’s consultant, Dr Ben Carpenter, mentions the risk of something and his mother, Fatuma – her face bright with hope and faith – says: “It’s not a risk. You are saving him.” The doctor pauses, balancing duty with care, kindness with honesty, professional ethics with human impulse. “There are definite risks involved,” he replies gently. “But we know the risks of not doing this are much higher.” Spouses must guide spouses, as Melly does for Graham, reminding him to weigh his quality of life – and his family’s life – against prolonged suffering in the name of treatment, however pioneering. Sometimes the normal dynamic reverses: patients must guide loved ones and children must do so for parents. After good initial results, Mahmoud cautioned his mother about being “too hasty”. He doesn’t want her to celebrate too early. Much, much older than his years, then. At an hour and 40 minutes, it was a film that was able to do justice to all its parts. It twined them round each other immaculately, keeping the march of the days and the clinical results clear to the uninitiated viewer without losing sight of the intimacy between everyone involved, or distancing the viewers from Graham or Mahmoud’s experiences, which lay at the heart of everything. It did a particularly fine job of honouring the dual perspective that exists in any clinical trial – the immediate, patient-based focus on individual treatment and outcomes by the administering doctors, and the detached, long-term view the scientists developing the treatment must take – without letting the more naturally sympathetic former outweigh or diminish the latter. There was agony and ecstasy by turns, and endless courage from Graham and Mahmoud and the people that love them. Lives and cells were taken apart and put back together in different forms. Godspeed, everyone."
191,cancer,Hospital gave teenage cancer victim's address to estranged father,"The mother of a girl who died of cancer a day after being diagnosed has said the hospital compounded her grief by sharing the family’s address with the teenager’s estranged father. The University Hospitals Bristol NHS foundation trust apologised to Kelly Baverstock and admitted it had breached its duty of confidentiality by giving doctor’s letters and her address to the father of 13-year-old Tanisha despite the fact he had not seen his daughter in years. Baverstock said that when hospital staff contacted her to disclose the situation, they said: “We have just given him all the letters and address details. What should we do?” She said she received a letter “apologising and admitting full liability for what they had done”. She said “it could have been anyone” who was given her details as there was no security process around sharing information. The Guardian has seen a letter from the trust to Baverstock apologising for the mistake. The trust wrote: “It is with the greatest regret that I am writing to say how very sorry we are for the failure in our duty of confidentiality that led to your address being shared with your estranged partner. We are terribly saddened that further distress will have inevitably been caused during this difficult time.” An investigation has been launched into Tanisha’s death. Baverstock said Tanisha was “skin and bone” and “barely able to lift her head” but Salisbury district hospital initially said she had a chest infection and prescribed antibiotics. The next day, Baverstock took Tanisha to Bristol Royal hospital for children, and after a five-hour wait Tanisha was diagnosed with cancer. She died within 24 hours. The teenager, from Wiltshire, had had a cough for weeks and gone to her family doctor twice in January. She was prescribed antibiotics, and a blood infection was discovered a week later. An outpatients appointment was booked at Salisbury. Despite telling Baverstock her daughter’s chest X-ray showed “changes to her lungs”, the hospital sent the pair home with antibiotics and told them to come back in four weeks. However, the next morning hospital staff called to say they had reviewed the X-rays and found “something really nasty growing in her lungs”. Baverstock drove Tanisha to Bristol Royal. “She had to walk 10 minutes and sit in A&amp;E while she could not hold up her head and her fingernails were turning purple,” she said. ”They told me that she was … riddled with [cancer] and breathing from one lung. They said she had the most aggressive cancer and it doubled every day.” She said her daughter had no end-of-life care or pain relief. A spokesperson for University Hospitals Bristol NHS foundation trust said of the address disclosure: “We would like to offer our sincerest apologies for this error occurring. We take confidentiality very seriously and have begun a thorough investigation into what happened. We have also informed the Information Commissioner’s Office in line with data protection requirements.”"
192,cancer,"Lifetime of drinking California water could raise cancer risk, study finds","Drinking California tap water over the course of a lifetime could increase the risk of cancer, according to a study published on Tuesday. Researchers with the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy non-profit, studied the combined health impacts of contaminants found in 2,737 community water systems throughout California and calculated that prolonged consumption of the contaminated water could cause almost 15,500 new cases of cancer. The study found traces of arsenic, hexavalent chromium, and disinfection byproducts in the water systems. All of these contaminants are regulated federally and on a state level. Trace amounts of some arelegally allowed in the water. But the study found that a majority of the cancer risk was due to the cumulative effect of these legally allowed amounts. “A large majority of the cancer risk, about 85% of it, is due to the combination of contaminants that are present at legal limits,” explained Tasha Stoiber, an Environmental Working Group senior scientist and the lead author of the report.   Related: Sinking land, poisoned water: the dark side of California's mega farms    “We have found that the majority of that risk was below the federal legal standard,” she told the Guardian. “These cumulative risks are based on health-based standards, not legally enforceable levels. So although the drinking water may get a passing grade, there still may be some health risks associated with it.” The California environmental protection agency said it was reviewing the study. “Assessing the cumulative risks from multiple contaminants is very complicated and there is no general consensus on the best way to do it,” said Sam Delson, a spokesman with the state office of environmental health hazard assessment. Stoiber and the other researchers looked at the reported contaminant levels from 2011 to 2015 and added together the averages of all reported contaminants to determine the cumulative risk – a tactic common when it comes to air pollutants, but rarely done when it comes to water, said Ashok Gadgil, a University of California, Berkeley civil and environmental engineering professor who was not involved in the study. “This is a very interesting and important way to bring the same methodology to water as we developed for air pollutants,” Gadgil said. “They’re opening up a new way for us to understand.” The researchers believe their cancer risk estimate may be conservative because the mixtures of contaminants may be more toxic than the sum of individual pollutants. While the study does not map out specific regions or water systems affected by contaminants, Stoiber pointed out that the cumulative effects were a “huge” issue in many smaller water systems in the state. In communities with fewer than 1,000 people, arsenic was the biggest factor in increased cancer risk, she added. Stoiber hopes that the study will lay the groundwork for approaching water pollutants in a more aggressive manner, instead of setting health limits on just one chemical at a time. “No one is just exposed to one chemical at a time,” she said. “Drinking water oftentimes contains multiple contaminants. “Drinking water standards haven’t kept pace with science, and drinking water treatment is expensive,” she said. “But we can always do better.”"
193,cancer,Rush drummer and lyricist Neil Peart dies at 67,"The Rush drummer and lyricist Neil Peart has died at the age of 67. The Canadian musician had been diagnosed with brain cancer three years ago and died on 7 January in Santa Monica, California. A representative for the band confirmed the news after a spokesperson for Peart’s family released a statement. “It is with broken hearts and the deepest sadness that we must share the terrible news that on Tuesday our friend, soul brother and band mate of over 45 years, Neil, has lost his incredibly brave three and a half year battle with brain cancer,” a statement from the band read.   Related: Rush: a band who sparked the teenage imagination like few others    Peart was seen as one of the industry’s most technically proficient rock drummers. He was inducted into the Modern Drummer hall of fame in 1983, making him the youngest ever honouree. The former Police drummer Stewart Copeland called him “the most air-drummed-to drummer of all time”. He first picked up a pair of drumsticks at the age of 13 and officially joined the band in 1974 at the age of 22, soon becoming their primary lyricist and penning the breakout song 2112. “He was one of the goofiest-looking guys I’d ever seen … Then he sat down behind this kit and pummelled the drums – and us,” Geddy Lee, the band’s frontman,  told the Guardian in 2018. “As far as I was concerned, he was hired from the minute he started playing.”     Alex Lifeson, Neil Peart and Geddy Lee in 1978. Photograph: Fin Costello/Redferns    Rush released 19 studio albums, selling more than 40m units worldwide. They are ranked third, behind the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, for most consecutive gold or platinum albums by a rock band.  “I’ve been put in this position, and I certainly don’t underrate that,” he said to Rolling Stone in 2012, admitting that he still took drumming lessons. “I get to be a professional drummer ... So it’s a full-time responsibility. It’s a joyous one and one I’m very grateful for.” Peart retired from the band in 2015 and the band declared itself finished in 2018. He also wrote seven non-fiction books, including the memoir Traveling Music: Playing Back the Soundtrack to My Life and Times. “The highest possible compliment is if someone that you admire respects your work,” Peart said in 2017. “To those that have said I inspired them to start drumming, the first thing I say is: ‘I apologise to your parents.’ But it’s wonderful just to be a little part of someone’s life like that.” On Twitter, Gene Simmons has offered his “prayers and condolences” to Peart’s family, calling him a “kind soul”. “I feel real bad about this - he was way too young,” Brian Wilson also tweeted. “Neil was one of the great drummers and he’ll be missed.” Peart is survived by his wife and 10-year-old daughter."
194,cancer,Jeremy Bowen reveals he is being treated for bowel cancer,"Jeremy Bowen, the veteran BBC foreign correspondent, has revealed that he is being treated for bowel cancer. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, a show he used to present, Bowen said he was diagnosed with the disease last October. “I had some funny pains in my legs and my back when I was in Iraq last May, and when I came back I had to go to hospital for a couple of days but they didn’t mention cancer, they said it was to do with scar tissue that I had from a previous surgery,” he told the hosts Dan Walker and Louise Minchin. “But I thought I should get a test, so I went to my GP, and I’d had none of the classic bowel cancer symptoms, nothing at all, but I thought I should get a test. “So I got a test and it was positive. I had a colonoscopy where they put a camera on a stick up your bottom, [which] is not nearly as bad as it sounds, and they give you lots of drugs and from that they found out that I had a tumour, and I had surgery, got [it] taken away and now I’m having chemotherapy.” He said his diagnosis “could have been a bit earlier, but had it been much later it would have been much worse”, and he urged viewers not to be embarrassed to go to their doctors if they feel pain. “The key thing is to get tested … Bowels and poo are not the normal things people want to talk about, but don’t die of embarrassment, for God’s sake.” Bowen said he had decided to go public for Bowel Cancer Awareness Month. “I’ve kept quiet about it except to my nearest and dearest and friends, but I thought why not? “And if me coming on your programme means a few extra people decide to get tested and as a result get their cancers caught, then it’s time well spent. Actually if there is something wrong with you, it’s far better to know. There’s great treatment there.” He added: “It’s more reassuring to know that something’s being dealt with than thinking: ‘I’ll wait till next week’. Don’t wait till next week!” Bowen is the BBC’s Middle East editor and has worked for the broadcaster since 1984. He has reported from more than 70 countries and covered conflicts in the Middle East and the former republics of Yugoslavia."
195,cancer,Labor budget reply: Bill Shorten pledges $2.3bn cancer care package,"Bill Shorten has used the final day of the 45th parliament to unveil a $2.3bn package to reduce out-of-pocket costs for cancer patients, while promising more generous tax relief for workers earning under $48,000 and a $440m injection for technical education. 
With the major parties now campaigning full-tilt in an undeclared election contest, the Labor leader used his budget reply speech to promise to eliminate out-of-pocket costs for cancer diagnostic imaging by opening up MRIs across the country for cancer scans, and allocating $600m to improve access to and affordability of diagnostic imaging. 
A further $433m will fund a new bulk-billed Medicare item for consultations with oncologists and surgeons for Australians diagnosed with cancer. Shorten also guaranteed to list all cancer drugs on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme recommended by experts. 
 
  Related: Bill Shorten's budget 2019 reply speech: Labor makes party's case for government – politics live  
 
As well as the big ticket cancer pledge, Shorten confirmed he would support but enhance the Morrison government’s tax rebate for low and middle-income earners promised in Tuesday’s budget, and would oppose stage two and three of the Coalition’s tax package, which benefits workers on high incomes – setting up a point of partisan conflict in the looming campaign. 
Shorten derided the government’s tax plan to flatten the tax scales as “a ticking debt bomb”. 
In a speech that was more campaign launch than conventional budget reply, Shorten appealed to Labor’s base, to women and to young voters, characterising his party’s proposed negative gearing reform and “real action on climate change” as tangible tests of generational fairness. He declared the economy must “work for everyone”. 
Shorten said workers earning less than $48,000 a year should not be short-changed. He promised to increase the government’s tax offset from 1 July, benefitting low-income and part-time workers, at a cost of $1.05bn over the forward estimates. 
He said 57% of people earning less than $48,000 were women – “childcare workers and classroom assistants, hairdressers, office managers and they are parents returning to work part-time”. 
“In a lot of these cases these are the very same workers in retail, hospitals, pharmacy and fast food, who have already had penalty rates arbitrarily cut,” Shorten said Thursday night. 
“Under Labor’s changes, which will apply from the 2018-19 financial year, workers earning up to $37,000 a year will receive a tax cut of up to $350. 
“For workers earning between $37,000 and $48,000 a year, the value of the offset will increase up to the maximum offset of $1,080”. 
The Morrison government increased health spending preemptively in Tuesday’s budget in an effort to blunt Labor’s expected ground campaign on government services, which was highly effective in 2016, but Shorten characterised his new cancer package as “the most important investment in Medicare since Bob Hawke created it”. 
The Labor leader said experiencing a cancer diagnosis was frightening, isolating and exhausting, “and – all too often – it is impoverishing. For so many people, cancer makes you sick and then paying for the treatment makes you poor.” 
 
  Related: Shorten commits $440m to Tafe and vocational education in Labor budget reply  
 
He said cancer patients faced huge out-of-pocket costs, with people in the regions particularly hard hit. “If someone you love had cancer, you would sell the shirt off your back, but should you have to?” 
Shorten said Australians paid their Medicare levy, and “if I’m elected prime minister, I’ll make sure that the healthcare system is there for you when you need it most”. 
The Labor leader said the scheme was affordable fiscally “because of our reform decisions. We choose our healthcare system over bigger tax loopholes”. 
Shorten predicted the tone of the coming election campaign would be negative. He said he was optimistic, and voters should choose hope over fear. 
“Labor offers stability and unity and a vision for the nation, we choose hope over fear, we choose the future over the past, we choose the best support possible for people with cancer,” Shorten said. 
“We choose fair wages and good jobs. We choose Tafe and apprenticeships, we choose a voice to First Australians enshrined in our constitution. 
“We choose renewables and we choose real action on climate change. We choose the ABC. We choose equality for women of Australia, equality for everyone. 
“If these things matter to you, if you believe that when all is said and done about politics the most important things are family and health, if you believe that handing on a better deal to your kids than the one you inherited from your parents, if you believe that is what is the sort of vision we should have for Australia – then when you cast your vote in May – choose a Labor government for all Australians”."
196,cancer,"If I get the virus, the NHS can't save me. That's why isolation is a matter of life and death","The first time my oncologist explained it I didn’t understand. “If you get coronavirus I won’t be able to get you a bed in the ICU,” she said. “That’s OK,” I said cheerfully, imagining there would be abed somewhere else in the hospital in which I would lie coughing. 
It was only when I put the phone down that her words hit home. What she was telling me wasn’t that there were no beds in the ICU but that there were no beds for me specifically. As the possible peak of the disease approaches and doctors face increasingly difficult decisions, so wartime triage will come into play. As a patient with stage IV cancer I will not pass that triage test. My life will not be considered long enough to save. 
While they haven’t spelled it out, this simple, bleak truth is largely what lies behind the government’s shielding policy for people like me. 
They are not so much shielding us because we will be worse-hit by the virus (although we may well be) as trying to prevent us from ever getting it. And they are doing this in order to ensure that the already overstretched and hardworking doctors of the NHS do not then have to condemn us to die. 
This bleak realisation was just one moment in what has been an increasingly surreal week. The experience I share with everyone else – trying to adjust to working from home, in my case alongside my husband and two children, aged 12 and 10 – now runs side-by-side with the experience of being one of the vulnerable, who cannot take a daily walk outside, who must keep their children three footsteps away at all times, and who would be stuck inside my house for 12 weeks even if other restrictions were lifted. 
In truth, my coronavirus paranoia had been raging for some time. 
One of the strangest aspects is that no matter how terrible my situation seemed, I never entirely thought I was going to die. 
There was always hope. Science was changing. New breakthroughs were coming all the time. Oncology is its own brand of witchcraft and there were always new spells to try. Checks and balances, different regimes and possible trials. When one chemo treatment started to stutter, my oncologist was always on hand with another suggestion, another tweak, another possible combination. It is 19 months since my triple negative breast cancer  was found to have spread and I am still alive. 
Then coronavirus arrived. At first I was furious. To have made it through 19 months of treatment for a particularly aggressive cancer only to succumb to something else entirely seemed too much to bear. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
That anger was soon replaced by fear. I found myself interrogating every member of my family as soon as they stepped through the door. Who had they talked to? Was anyone ill? How much contact had they had? My daughter, getting the London underground to school every day, reported packed trains filled with people coughing. In the past I would have shrugged it off as the tail end of winter bugs but now… 
I went into isolation. My husband had already decided to work from home, and I soon pulled my children from their schools, three days before the government shut them, worried that with each day my chances of survival were worsening. 
It was only when we were all at home, rubbing along with only the occasional explosion, working and laughing and starting to enjoy the new regime of interesting movies each evening, that reality finally hit home. 
My biggest concern wasn’t the virus itself – it was the disease I already had. It was the fact that I still had to get treatments and tests and scans but now I had to do it in hospitals that were likely to become increasingly stretched, with staff who were themselves liable to fall ill. Because what you don’t think about when you’re living in a pandemic is that none of the other illnesses cease to exist. Car crashes still happen. Heart attacks still happen. Cancer patients continue to need those tweaks and adjustments that have continued to keep them alive. 
On Tuesday I spoke to my oncologist. She had patients who were stopping treatment. Some had chosen to; others had been advised to. Everything was about relieving the NHS burden and protecting those most at risk. I am currently on oral chemo so she felt I should continue; however, she’d prefer me to take a two months’ supply and a series of injections to prevent me coming into the hospital during the worst. Oh, but before that could I come in on Friday, have a scan and give blood, just so they could see how my tumours were behaving? 
On Friday I went to Charing Cross Hospital in west London. The usually bustling building resembled a ghost town. Waiting areas were empty, corridors deserted, the lift had one passenger: me. Signs everywhere reminded us to wash our hands. It felt eerily like being in the eye of a hurricane, that moment when the storm is all around but has yet to break, when the true horror has yet to come. 
Yet it was also business as usual. My PET scan was straightforward (and quicker than it can be). My bloods were taken, my injection given. I went home having touched nothing and followed my oncologist’s advice to wash everything I was wearing and have a shower. 
Then the bad news. The scan suggested the cancer, subdued for so long, is growing. The oral chemo may not hold it. Weekly intravenous chemo could be the only answer. But what of the surge? My oncologist stressed again as she had at the beginning of the week that there would be no ICU bed if I caught coronavirus. This time I wasn’t confused. 
So here we are. With 11 weeks of lockdown to go and the knowledge that I will probably spend every Friday, with face mask and gloves, crossing every finger and praying to every god, not just the Catholic one I was raised with, that the chemo works, that I don’t get the virus, that the nurses and doctors, the physios and OTs, the receptionists and cleaners, the pharmacists and restaurant workers, all those people who keep the great machine of this great hospital ticking over, stay safe and well. 
The rest of the time I’ll probably fail to keep that three-step distance, hug my children a little closer, kiss my husband and continue the crash course in great movies that’s going down so well.

197,cancer,NHS cancer centre loses scanning contract to private firm,"NHS chiefs are pushing through plans to let private companies take over scanning services that are vital in treating cancer patients, having told ministers last week that privatisation was harming patient care. Despite its international reputation for cancer care, Churchill hospital in Oxford has lost its contract to carry out PET-CT scans to InHealth, a private company, as part of the tendering process, the Guardian can reveal. Doctors at the hospital said they were “disgusted” by the loss of the contract, warning that people receiving cancer treatment in the hospital will have to be taken by ambulance to two new locations at which InHealth’s scanners will be located. The decision has raised questions about NHS England’s professed desire to end the outsourcing of patient care, which it outlined in a detailed policy document released at a board meeting last week. The Churchill is the first NHS hospital to lose out as a result of NHS England deciding in 2016 to put positron emission tomography-computed tomography services out to tender. The 3D scans of inside the body help doctors spot tumours and check if cancer treatment is working. NHS England initiated the tender process to save money. However, major teaching hospitals, including King’s College hospital in London, and cancer hospitals such as the Christie in Manchester, are also at risk of having PET-CT services handed to the private sector. NHS England has invited profit-driven companies to bid against NHS trusts for contracts to provide PET-CT scanning in 11 different areas of England. Labour demanded that the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, block the sell-off. “This latest NHS privatisation exposes as utterly hollow the health secretary’s promises to parliament that there will be no privatisation on his watch,” said Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health and social care secretary. “Just last week, NHS England claimed it wanted to bring an end to the constant tendering of contracts that the Lansley reorganisation ushered in. Patients will therefore consider it bewildering this privatisation has been allowed to proceed.” Oncologists at the Churchill are “very concerned” by InHealth – a British company that already provides diagnostic services to the NHS – starting to provide PET-CT scans to the 2 million people who live in the Thames Valley area. The hospital, which has performed that role since 2005, will now have to hand back the two scanners it leases in order to produce the images. “Another provider might offer scans more cheaply, but will they match the quality?” an oncologist said. “We’re worried people may end up needing rescanning and, at the end of the day, ultimately it is patients who will suffer.” The expertise of the Churchill’s nuclear medicine department in undertaking high-quality PET scans will be lost to the NHS, the doctor added. Specialist cancer doctors at Oxford University hospitals NHS trust, which runs the Churchill, said they have “concerns about the potential impact on the safety and quality of patient care at the loss of the current PET-CT service at the Churchill”. They added: “If the service was no longer provided here, it would mean that very sick patients at the Churchill would need to travel off-site for a scan, which could have a negative impact on their health.” Paul Evans, who runs the NHS Support Federation, which monitors privatisation of healthcare, said: “There’s a jarring contradiction between the proposals to privatise these cancer services and recent statements from NHS England about the failure of this kind of tendering. “PET-CT is of crucial importance in the management of patients with cancer. So why risk the care of patients by taking this service away from a world-renowned centre with an established team of experts in the field, working together within the NHS, to move the service into the private sector?” InHealth did not respond to requests for comment. NHS England insisted existing EU-wide procurement law meant it had to tender the services. “The law is as yet unchanged in the way we recently recommended it should be, so in the meantime, existing procurement rules apply. In the Thames Valley, this particular process means two new sites being introduced for this particular scanning,” a spokesperson said."
198,cancer,Tuesday briefing: Covid-19 danger jumps from middle age,"Top story: Lancet study gives picture of age-related risk 
Hello, Warren Murray with you again, and don’t be surprised if you start seeing teddy bears appearing in people’s windows. 
The first comprehensive study of Covid-19 deaths and hospitalisations in mainland China has revealed in stark detail the increase in risk for coronavirus patients once they reach middle age. Four per cent of infected people in their 40s needed hospital treatment, as did more than 8% of patients in their 50s. More than 18% of those in their 80s and above needed hospitalisation after catching the virus. Only 0.04% of 10 to 19-year-olds had to go into hospital if infected. 
The analysis found that while the overall death rate for confirmed cases was 1.38% it rose sharply with age, from 0.0016% in the under 10s to 7.8% in those 80 and over. The study reported in Lancet Infectious Diseases was based on analysis of 70,117 laboratory-confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases in mainland China, combined with 689 positive cases among people repatriated from Wuhan. The number of deaths related to coronavirus in the US has passed 3,000, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. Meanwhile today marks a week of no new cases reported in Wuhan city, China, where the outbreak first emerged. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US is almost double those in China. The pandemic’s economic fallout could cause China’s growth to come to a standstill while driving 11 million more people in East Asia into poverty, the World Bank has warned. 
In major European cities homeless people are increasingly going hungry during the enforced lockdown and even being issued with police fines for being outside, Daniel Boffey writes from Brussels. A shortfall in protective supplies for staff means food banks and soup kitchens have closed, while efforts to stop the spread have ranged from shelters in Amsterdam turning residents out during the day, to homeless people being herded into gymnasiums in Paris to stop them gathering outside. From Las Vegas there have been jarring images of an open-air carpark being used as a “shelter” for homeless people who had to be turned out of a 500-bed facility when a resident tested positive.

Family killed in West Sussex – A family of four have been found dead at a home in West Sussex. The bodies of two adults and two children were discovered in the village of Woodmancote on Sunday evening. Sussex police launched a murder investigation but said they were not seeking anyone else in connection with the deaths. Officers attended after receiving a call raising a welfare concern about the residents. All of the victims were believed to be members of the same family, the force said, and all were pronounced dead at the scene.

Test spots cancer’s DNA fingerprints – A blood test that can detect more than 50 types of cancer has been revealed by researchers. It picks up chemical changes in DNA that is shed by tumours and ends up circulating in the blood. Researchers say the test can not only tell whether someone has cancer but also what type. The test was developed using a machine learning algorithm that examined “methylation” patterns in cancerous and non-cancerous DNA. The rate at which it could detect cancer varied, but reached 93% in advanced cases. Researchers say it also offers hope in regard to cancers that are otherwise difficult to detect. The system correctly identified 63% of those with stage I pancreatic cancer, rising to 100% in stage IV.

Carbon harms your planet’s health – Graphic cigarette packet-like warnings should appear on high-carbon products from airline tickets and energy bills to petrol pumps, to show consumers the health impacts of the climate crisis, say public health experts. Writing in the British Medical Journal, they argue it would “sensitise people to the consequences of their actions, representing nudges designed to encourage users to choose alternatives to fossil fuels, thus increasing demand for zero-carbon renewable energy”. Previous attempts to label goods with the amount of carbon that went into their production petered out as consumers found them hard to understand.

199,cancer,Monday briefing: Harry's 'great sadness' at stepping away,"Top story: ‘There really was no other option’ 
Good morning and welcome to this first briefing of the week with me, Alison Rourke. 
Prince Harry has broken his silence on stepping away from royal duties, saying he and his wife, Meghan, would continue to “lead a life of service” but had “no other option”. In a speech at his HIV charity Sentebale, in London, he said he had hoped to continue serving the Queen without public funding but that wasn’t possible: “It brings me great sadness that it has come to this.” He said the decision to step back had not been taken lightly and that it came after “so many months of talks after so many years of challenges”. 
Appearing to lay the blame at the feet of the press, he said the media was “a powerful force”, adding that the UK was his home “and a place that I love”. 
The couple will give up their His and Her Royal Highness titles and return £2.4m to the taxpayer to cover the cost of refurbishing their Windsor home, Frogmore.

‘Eliminated altogether’ – Cervical cancer could be eradicated in England through vaccines and screening for HPV, the virus that causes most cases of the disease, according to NHS England. The disease kills 850 women each year in the UK. From the beginning of December, routine screening has been reoriented to test primarily for HPV. Only those who have the virus will have their smear sample checked for abnormal cells that are the precursor of cervical cancer. “Combined with the success of the HPV vaccine for both boys and girls, we hope that cervical cancer can be eliminated altogether by the NHS in England,” said Prof Peter Johnson, the national clinical director for cancer.

Luanda leaks – A seven-month investigation has revealed for the first time the complex financial schemes that have helped Africa’s richest woman – Angola’s Isabel dos Santos – amass a fortune at vast cost to her country. A huge leak of confidential documents raise questions over preferential deals and lucrative transactions with the Angolan state worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Dos Santos is known as “the princess” in Angola and is the daughter of former president José Eduardo dos Santos. The material reveals an opaque network of about 400 companies, many of them offshore, connected to Dos Santos and her husband, the businessman and art collector Sindika Dokolo, and their associates. The couple has rejected any allegation of wrongdoing and vehemently denied being financed by state money.

Lunchtime read: how Gary Beadle’s career survived leaving EastEnders 
Albert Square’s bad boy was told leaving the long-running show would end his career. “The test was, ‘Can you do EastEnders and then work again afterwards?’ Apparently, everyone who does it never works again. I liked the odds on that. I thought, ‘Let’s see if I can pull it off.’ ” But, as he tells Bridget Minamore, he has no regrets. Since his exit in 2004, the actor has has worked at the National, Almeida and Royal Court theatres, and had roles on various TV dramas including Patrick Melrose. “There’s times where I was like, ‘Oh my God, I’ve been doing this most of my life, but I don’t think I can act. I’ve been lying to myself all along.’ So I had to reinvent myself. And I did that through theatre, which is where I started.”
