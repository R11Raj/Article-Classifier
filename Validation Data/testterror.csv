0,terror,Newcastle man admits inciting terror attacks in Germany,"A Newcastle man has admitted inciting people to commit terror attacks in Germany, and buying explosive equipment. Fatah Mohammed Abdullah, 35, bought more than 8,000 matches, fireworks, fuses, explosives precursors – or substances that could be used to manufacture explosives – and a remote control detonator. His intention was to help Omar Babek and Ahmed Hussein commit acts of terrorism in Germany, a video-link hearing at Liverpool crown court heard on Friday. The British-Iranian, from the Arthur’s Hill area of the city, pleaded guilty to inciting terrorism overseas and engaging in conduct in preparation for giving effect to an intention to assist others to commit terror attacks. Charges against the defendant state that between 9 April 2018 and 11 December 2018, he encouraged others to commit terror attacks in the country, including by driving a car into a crowd, attacking people with a meat cleaver and setting off bombs. The court heard he had searched for guides to explosives online and had tested a remote detonation system. Psychiatric reports will be prepared on the defendant, who appeared via video link from HMP Belmarsh, before his sentencing on 7 May. The judge, Mr Justice Sweeney, said the hearing was unlikely to be held in person. “In the current situation, where we are going to be in six weeks’ time is not readily available but the likelihood is we will be needing some kind of video system,” he said."
1,terror,Amanda review – muted Paris terror attack drama,"This tasteful, muted exploration of personal trauma imagines the aftermath of a fictional terrorist attack in modern-day Paris, presumably inspired by the Bataclan massacre of 2015. When single mother Sandrine (Ophélia Kolb) is killed, her 24-year-old brother, David (Vincent Lacoste), must assume responsibility for her seven-year-old daughter, Amanda (Isaure Multrier). Multrier has an incredibly expressive face, able to telegraph a grieving child’s mixed emotions, spanning anger, pain, petulance, incredulity and ruddy-cheeked joy. It’s also touching to watch David’s confidence and sense of purpose grow as their relationship blossoms. Still, the film shies away from any kind of political commentary, and as a result feels oddly sapped of fire or urgency. There are glimmers of context, such as a refugee camp shown from the vantage point of a tree, just beyond the periphery of the park where David works. A TV news reporter declares that “Islamist terrorism is the most likely explanation” for the attack, but it’s a snippet overheard in a bar. David and Amanda pass a pair of locals shouting something at a veiled Muslim woman, but the conversation is inaudible. This cultivated distance, coupled with Anton Sanko’s wistful score and the creamy-white light that bathes Paris’s manicured streets, only works to further ensconce them in a bubble of privilege. Not a problem if that were the point, but in a scene that sees Amanda ask her uncle why their family doesn’t believe in God, it seems as though director Mikhaël Hers is emphasising his own supposedly neutral position.           Watch the trailer for Amanda. "
2,terror,Sahel faces surge in violence from terror attacks,"The Sahel is facing an unprecedented wave of violence, with more than 4,000 deaths reported last year, and a bloody start to 2020. The number of attacks have increased fivefold in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger since 2016, United Nations figures have revealed. Mohamed Ibn Chambas, the UN’s envoy for the fragile region on the southern rim of the Sahara, said it had experienced “a devastating surge in terrorist attacks against civilian and military targets”. In Burkina Faso, the number of deaths rose from about 80 in 2016 to more than 1,800 in 2019. On Tuesday, authorities in Ouagadougou, the capital, said dozens of civilians had been killed in the latest attack by suspected Islamic militants on a village market in the northern province of Sanmatenga. Chambas told the UN security council earlier this month that the “devastating surge in terrorist attacks against civilian and military targets” would have alarming humanitarian consequences in the region and was set to spread. “Most significantly, the geographic focus of terrorist attacks has shifted eastwards from Mali to Burkina Faso and is increasingly threatening west African coastal states,” he said earlier this month. European officials are worried the Sahel is close to a tipping point that could see an irreversible slide into violent chaos that will strengthen extremist groups and send a new wave of migrants to Europe. Extremist violence in the Sahel surged after a coalition of Islamists and local separatist tribesmen took control over much of northern Mali in 2012. A seven-year campaign led by French troops, the deployment of hundreds of US special forces, massive aid for local militaries and a billion dollar-a-year United Nations peacekeeping operation have been unable to decisively weaken the multiple overlapping insurgencies in the region and security has continued to deteriorate. Many of the bloodiest recent attacks have been attributed to an Isis affiliate, Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS). In November, two attacks claimed by the ISGS on military bases in Mali, at Tabankort and Indelimane, claimed the lives of 92 soldiers. In December, the group claimed responsibility for the killing of 42 people – 35 of them civilian – in Arbinda in Burkina Faso. More than 170 soldiers have died in two recent ISGS attacks in Niger. European security officials believe the claims of responsibility by the ISGS are credible, though the group frequently exaggerates its capabilities. It is not clear who was responsible for this week’s attack in Burkina Faso, though Islamic militants are active in the area. Chambas said attacks were often “deliberate efforts by violent extremists to capture weapons and trafficking routes”. The ISGS has adopted tactics pioneered by the al-Qaida affiliate al-Shabab, which has been fighting foreign and national forces in Somalia for more than a decade. Attacks are launched by dozens of jihadists arriving on motorbikes who overrun often scant defences after cutting off the camp’s communications and pounding the site with mortars. They then kill as many soldiers as possible and then disappear before the army can fully respond. “The latest attacks seem to show that the group has acquired skills in command, control and coordination that it didn’t have before, with group leaders able to carry out major operations,” a French military source told Reuters news agency. The group’s rapid expansion in the Sahel will not compensate strategically for the loss of its heartland in Iraq and Syria, nor the death in October of its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, but will boost morale among its beleaguered fighters and help attract new recruits. It will also underline the continuing primacy of Islamic State in its long-running rivalry with al-Qaida, the older group from which it split six years ago. Analysts say the ISGS, like other jihadist groups in the Sahel, uses “ad hoc” fighters to beef up its ranks, with up to 70% of the force launched against military bases hired just for the operation from local communities. Many are poachers, criminals or traffickers who are paid with cash, weapons or ammunition. The hard core of ISGS is probably no more than 200- or 300-strong, specialists say. French forces total 4,500 and there are more than 13,000 UN peacekeepers. Chambas said terrorism, organised crime and intercommunal violence were often intertwined, especially in peripheral areas where a state’s presence was weak where “extremists provide safety and protection to populations, as well as social services in exchanged for loyalty”. The rise in violence comes amid reports that the US is likely to reduce its military presence in the Sahel, as it refocuses on great power rivals as a more significant threat than terrorism. The US currently has thousands of troops in the region and recently opened a major $100m air base in Niger. The prospect of many of its forces withdrawing from the region has dismayed many actors. A small detachment of British troops is due to deploy later this year to Mali as part of the UN peacekeeping force there."
3,terror,Revealed: how teachers could unwittingly trigger counter-terror inquiries,"Teachers, doctors and other public-sector workers could unwittingly spark counter-terrorism inquiries when they seek advice about the government’s controversial Prevent strategy, sensitive documents seen by the Guardian reveal. A heavily redacted copy of the official policy framework for Prevent, the strategy designed to catch those at risk of committing terrorist violence, was released to the human rights group Liberty under the Freedom of Information Act and shared with the Guardian. The guidance, marked “Official, sensitive”, states that when public sector workers, who are legally bound to report concerns, contact Prevent staff for advice, “this may result in a referral” to the anti-radicalisation programme. Counter-terrorism policing headquarters (CTPHQ), which composed the document, confirmed that it does not seek approval or consent to refer an individual, which could include school pupils or medical patients, to Prevent from those who contact them for advice. Critics of Prevent said the revelations provide further evidence that the strategy is for monitoring potential extremists rather than safeguarding vulnerable people from radicalisation. But CTPHQ insisted that the processes in place for handling advice and referrals were designed to protect the public as well as individuals at risk of harm.   Related: Environment and animal rights activists being referred to Prevent programme    Rosalind Comyn, Liberty’s policy and campaigns officer, said: “The Prevent strategy is designed to co-opt public sector workers like teachers to monitor and report on people in their care. The revelation that those workers could be unwittingly handing children to the police, not knowing the consequences of simply raising a query, reinforces concerns about how Prevent is eroding what should be trusted relationships. “The government’s definition of extremism is so staggeringly broad, it can be used to demonise thousands of people based on what they are perceived to think or believe – adding to the confusion and pressure public workers face. If you are a Muslim, or person of colour, the perils of Prevent are all too familiar, and it has only served to create further discrimination and division in our communities.” The disclosures come with the independent review of Prevent, a commitment to which was written into legislation, mired in crisis. The review’s chair, Lord Carlile, was forced to step down nine weeks ago over allegations regarding his lack of impartiality and the government is yet to appoint a replacement. The strategy has faced renewed scrutiny following revelations in the Guardian that counter-terrorism policing had produced documents used as Prevent resources, which featured nonviolent groups like Extinction Rebellion alongside far-right extremists such as the banned terror group National Action. Some documents have been withdrawn, while others are to be amended. Dr Rob Faure Walker, a former secondary-school teacher who completed a PhD investigating the impact of counter-extremism discourses in educational settings, said: “Prevent teams do not know the children referred to them, so to learn that the consent of the teacher who does know the child might not be sought is a further indication that Prevent is not designed in the best interests of children. “This confirms that efforts to brand Prevent as safeguarding are a cynical move to hide the imposition of surveillance on our most important civic institutions.” Walker, who is currently working on a project called Corridors of Power at Soas University of London, which aims to bring expert briefings to parliament on a range of policy issues, said: “The tragedy of Prevent is that casting teachers and doctors as informants prevents their students and patients from having the conversations that could otherwise act as a pressure release for legitimate grievances. “When previously working as a teacher, I always found that children who aired hateful views in class could find legitimate political responses to their frustrations by talking about them.” Liberty criticised CTPHQ for redacting large swathes of the document, which is titled Policy for Prevent Practitioners, including two of the five “strategic objectives” for Prevent, arguing that objectives for a significant policy like Prevent should always be made public. The Guardian asked officials at CTPHQ to reconsider removing the redactions on the listed objectives, but they declined. The national coordinator for Prevent, Ch Supt Nik Adams, said: “The Policy for Prevent Practitioners is a restricted document that describes our procedures for handling sensitive information and managing risk. “To release this document without redactions would be to directly instruct radicalisers and terrorists in how to circumvent policies that we have put in place to manage the intelligence we use to protect vulnerable people from radicalisation, and would thus increase the risk we all face from terrorism. “Surely most people would agree that we must try to make it harder for terrorists to cause harm to this country, not easier.”   Related: Priti Patel’s plan to tackle radicalised youth is so flawed it’s mad, says study    He added: “When Prevent partners call the police for advice on someone showing signs of vulnerability to radicalisation, it becomes the police’s legal responsibility to make a decision on whether that person is at risk and worthy of a referral. “If we listen to the circumstances and decide that a referral is inappropriate, then no further action would be taken. But if we believe there to be a risk to someone’s safety, then we would be obligated to take appropriate action to protect the person in question – just like we would for any other form of grooming. “For example, if someone called the police with concerns that a child was being groomed for sexual abuse, we would never disregard that child’s safety just because we were asked to. Extremist grooming of child causes significant harm and is no different.” The document does reveal more about the database used by police forces to store the details of people who have been referred to Prevent. The Police Case Management Tracker (PCMT) replaced all recording by local authorities on spreadsheets with a national IT system in July 2018, the document says. Information recorded on the database includes “biographical information, nature of vulnerability, and counter-terror/domestic extremism risks” as well as “any intervention or action by police or a partner”, the guidance reveals. The stated aim of Prevent, a voluntary programme, is to divert people from terrorism before they offend and crucially deals with individuals who have yet to cross the criminality threshold. Each Prevent referral is added to the PCM database by individual police forces, including personal details and reasons for the referral, but the person is not notified, responses to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests submitted by Liberty showed."
4,terror,"Morning mail: Coronavirus evacuation, London 'terror' stabbing, Djokovic triumphs","Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 3 February. Top stories Australians stranded in the Chinese city of Wuhan were expected to fly out of the city on Monday morning as they make their way towards Christmas Island. It is understood the flight was due to depart from Wuhan at 2am local time (5am AEDT) and would head straight to mainland Australia, where those on board will then be transported to Christmas Island for a 14-day quarantine period. Footage of government officials in Wuhan appearing to take face masks intended for health workers battling the highly infectious coronavirus has fuelled a growing wave of anger over how Chinese authorities have handled the outbreak. It comes as the Philippines has reported the first death from the coronavirus outside China, adding to fears about the spread of the virus as more countries imposed travel restrictions. China’s central bank has pledged to pump 1.2tn yuan (A$256bn) into its financial system in an attempt to protect its economy from the coronavirus epidemic. Bridget McKenzie has resigned from Scott Morrison’s ministry in an effort to stem the rolling controversy and political damage over sports grants before the opening of the 2020 parliamentary session this week. The prime minister confirmed the departure of the besieged deputy leader of the Nationals late on Sunday after receiving advice from his departmental head and former chief of staff, Phil Gaetjens, and after a meeting with the governance committee of cabinet. Morrison declined to release the Gaetjens adjudication. “Morrison wants this whole mess to be over with McKenzie’s departure,” writes Katherine Murphy. “Quick prediction. This isn’t over.” A man has been shot dead by armed police in south London following a terrorist-related incident in which a number of people are believed to have been stabbed. The Metropolitan police confirmed the man, who was shot at about 2pm in Streatham, had been pronounced dead and added: “We believe there are two injured victims. We await updates on their conditions.” They said the scene had been “fully contained”. The man shot dead by police was wearing a “fake suicide vest” made of objects designed to look like an improvised explosive device.

Recommended reads     Have claims of a sex recession been exaggerated? Data shows Australian millennials and Gen Xers were actually having slightly less sex in their teenage years than Gen Z is today. Illustration: Guardian Design    In 2019 the idea of a millennial and Gen Z “sex recession” became fact. “Or it became the 2019 version of a fact: something we all (myself included) absorb after reading viral headlines on Facebook,” writes Meg Watson. “Last year ABC’s national survey Australia Talks found that 40% of people aged 18 to 24 report ‘never’ having sex. Since then, young people have been lightly mocked on ABC TV, and in the Daily Telegraph. They’ve even been made the subject of an ‘intervention’-based ad campaign for a condom company. But as clicky as that story sounds, it’s not the whole truth. Instead of scolding young people for not having sex which they are in fact having, maybe we could look to them to understand the many ways that modern sex is changing.” “Q&amp;A succeeded because it created an opportunity that hadn’t existed for ordinary Australians to challenge our politicians directly and measure their responses,” writes Peter McEvoy, the program’s former executive producer as part of Guardian Australia’ Unforgettable Australian TV series. “We brought together Australian citizens from diverse political and cultural backgrounds to discuss the direction of the nation … After 12 years at Q&amp;A my faith in the power of reasoned discussion to change minds and build a consensus has taken a battering, but I can’t identify any pathway forward that isn’t built on bringing together people with divergent views to listen, debate and discuss.” Listen/Watch On today’s Full Story podcast, Guardian Australia editor Lenore Taylor explores Australia’s long track record of stalling on climate change action.

5,terror,Darkness at noon: Australia's bushfire day of terror,"Daybreak never came to Mallacoota. By dawn on Tuesday the orange bushfire glow had disappeared from the horizon, replaced by a black shadow of smoke and ash that made early morning in the Victorian seaside town seem like midnight. 
As massive swathes of the East Gippsland region burned, Mallacoota was one of the few areas where residents and holidaymakers had not been told to evacuate for their own safety. By the time the fire arrived on Monday, it was too late for many of them to leave. 
Amid the darkness, there was chaos. A stampede towards the town’s foreshore where thousands stood and huddled and watched the black sky turn red. As traffic banked up, people abandoned their cars and ran towards the water.

Soon after, emergency sirens from firefighting tankers heralded a further warning. Get in the water. Those who could scrambled onto boats. Others hugged the shoreline or waded in.

“It’s mayhem out there, it’s armageddon,” Charles Livingstone told Guardian Australia on Tuesday morning from a community centre where hundreds more had taken shelter. 
“The other issue is how the hell we’re all going to get out of here – there’s one road in and one road out.”

Grim news 
Mallacoota was only the first of what became a litany of towns devastated by the fires as the carnage spread up the New South Wales coast and to tiny inland villages. 
Further west, in the East Gippsland region where residents had been warned to evacuate on Sunday, ominous images showed towns such as Sarsfield had lost numerous properties.

Residents of Bermagui were also forced to flee to the beach. And a few kilometres inland, horror was unfolding in the tiny village of Cobargo, where by mid-morning images began to seep out revealing that a good part of the main street had been entirely destroyed.

 A local resident, Brenda Whiffen, told the ABC the fire came through about 1am. 
“We came outside and you could see the red glow, but you could hear it roaring, that was the scary bit. You could hear it roaring like the ocean,” she said. 
Next in the firing line was Batemans Bay, one of the larger towns on the NSW south coast, where fire encircled residents and holidaymakers, forcing them into evacuation centres and to the town’s beaches.

“Right now in my house there’s animals of all description in all the different rooms,” the zoo’s director, Chad Staples, said. 
“A couple of hours ago it felt like armageddon here. It was as black as midnight with tinges of red. It was like we were fighting fires in the darkness.” 
In the village centre, leather shop owner Lorena Granados spent most of the morning attempting to save the building. Eventually she and her family members were forced to flee, as the flames became overpowering and tore through several buildings and homes.

“We couldn’t breathe. We couldn’t see. The flames were just ferocious, they were furious, they were angry. There was nothing we could do, we had to pretty much save ourselves.” 
Fresh crisis 
Suddenly, in mid-afternoon, a fresh crisis blew up much further north, when spot fires from the Currowan blaze cut the Pacific Highway near Sussex Inlet, sending smoke billowing over the small settlements around Jervis Bay.

The NSW rural fire commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, said late on Tuesday it was “one of the worst, if not the worst fire season we have experienced”. 
Back at Mallacoota, firefighters managed to beat the bushfire back at the town precipice. Shortly before 4pm a cheer went up at the foreshore, as word spread that the immediate threat was over; a wind change had pushed the blaze in another direction. 
But everyone in the town, along with others in East Gippsland and some on the New South Wales coast, remained hemmed in by the fire front, unable to leave. 
Late on Tuesday it was announced that all telecommunications would be cut for the whole of the NSW coast between Nowra and Moruya, for up to 24 hours. The defence minister, Linda Reynolds, said helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and naval vessels would be deployed to supply, and potentally evacuate, those trapped on the Victorian coast. 
As night fell, the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, could not bring himself to wish his state a happy new year. Instead he offered the same greeting that thousands of other Australians had exchanged throughout a harrowing day: stay safe."
6,terror,Britain First leader Paul Golding charged by anti-terror police,"Paul Golding, the leader of the fringe far-right group Britain First, has been charged with an offence under the Terrorism Act after refusing to give police access to his phone. He was stopped at Heathrow airport in October while returning from a trip to the Russian parliament in Moscow by officers from the Metropolitan police’s counter-terrorism command. He refused to give the Pin codes for a number of his electronic devices. Golding, 38, is charged with refusing to comply with a duty under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act. A Met spokesman said Golding, of Bexley in south-east London, was charged by postal requisition on Wednesday. He is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on 27 February. In a statement Golding said he was not a terrorist and described the charges as “an abuse of legislation”. Schedule 7 allows police to interrogate, search and detain anyone for up to six hours at UK ports. It is designed to determine whether an individual is involved in the “commission, preparation or instigation” of acts of terrorism. Britain First achieved brief notoriety in late 2017 after Donald Trump retweeted anti-Muslim messages sent by the party’s then deputy leader, Jayda Fransen, prompting international condemnation. The group was fined more than £44,000 last July for what the Electoral Commission said were multiple breaches of electoral law, including undeclared donations and a failure to provide proper accounts."
7,terror,Urgent crackdown on terror sentences will affect about 50 inmates,"About 50 prisoners convicted of terror offences will no longer be automatically freed halfway through their sentences, under emergency government legislation designed to prevent further jihadi attacks by recently released inmates. The urgent introduction of a parliamentary bill on Tuesday – due to become law before the end of the month – is aimed at pre-empting the release of any more prisoners serving a fixed-length terrorist sentence. The move follows the London Bridge knife attacks by Usman Khan in November last year and the Streatham stabbings by Sudesh Amman this month. Both men were convicted terrorists released mid-term from prison on licence. Most of the 50 or so inmates affected by retrospective changes to enforcement of their sentences are believed to be serving time for jihadism-related crimes, though others may be far-right activists. Of the 224 inmates serving time for terror-related offences in British prisons in September last year, 77% were classed as having Islamist extremist views and 17% were deemed to support far-right ideologies. A total of 53 prisoners held for terror offences were released in the year up to the end of June 2019.  The Henry Jackson Society, a thinktank, estimates there are 11 terror offenders on fixed sentences who would have been eligible for early release this year before the law was changed, including five individuals who would otherwise have been freed in late February and early March. The first is Mohammed Zahir Khan, a shopkeeper from Sunderland, who was sentenced to four years and six months in May 2018 at the age of 40 for nine counts of sharing Islamist material on social media and encouraging religious hatred, including by tweeting support for Isis and calling for the death of Shia Muslims. He is understood to have been due for automatic release on 28 February. Others that the thinktank says are due for automatic release in March include Mohammed Ghani, from Barnet, north London, who in 2019 was sentenced to 28 months for four offences including threatening to kill police officers in a call to 999 and possessing the Isis propaganda magazine Inspire. Mohammed Khilji, from Brent, north-west London, who was jailed in June 2018 for five years on eight counts of encouraging terrorism by sharing graphic videos of Isis beheadings and videos calling for violence against non-Muslims, was also due to be freed shortly. Aras Hamid, jailed for eight years in January 2017 for trying to leave the country and travel to Syria to join Isis, would have been eligible for release this year. He was arrested in the back of a lorry in a layby at Dover. Hamid has also tried to make arrangements for others to travel to Syria, and was found to have possessed what the Crown Prosecution Service said was large quantities of terrorist material. The government argues the changes, though applying to those already behind bars and effectively retrospective, do not alter the total length of sentences imposed by the courts. Instead of being freed automatically halfway through their sentence, inmates will be forced to spend a minimum of two-thirds of their term behind bars before being referred to the Parole Board, which will consider their release. Those receiving sentences for offenders of particular concern (SOPCs) will also be affected. The legislation will cover England, Wales and Scotland but not Northern Ireland. Anyone sentenced to less than two years for relatively minor terror offences – such as wearing a uniform or displaying an article of a proscribed organisation – will be excluded from the changes. Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, said: “No dangerous terrorist should be released automatically only to go on to kill and maim innocent people on our streets. Enough is enough. This government will do whatever it takes to keep the public safe, including making sure no terror offender is released early without a thorough risk assessment by the Parole Board. “We are [also] stepping-up deradicalisation measures in our prisons, introducing a 14-year minimum for the worst terrorist offenders, and giving more money to the police to deal with these horrific crimes.” Priti Patel, the home secretary, said: “Recent months have been a stark reminder of the threat we continue to face from terrorism. We are determined to ensure that dangerous terrorists are not free to spread their hateful ideologies or harm the public. “We are already boosting funding for counter-terrorism police and victims of terrorism and this legislation will ensure terrorist offenders are not released early unless there has been a full assessment of the risks.” The government has separately pledged to introduce tougher sentences for serious terrorist offenders and a 14-year minimum for the worst terrorist offenders. It is also ending any early release from custody for those receiving an extended determinate sentence. Polygraph or lie-detector testing will be introduced for terrorist offenders freed on licence. There have been threats to challenge any new restrictions on behalf of those forced to serve longer in jail by bringing a judicial review. However, no such cases are believed to have been lodged in the courts so far. There is likely to be extra pressure on the Parole Board for more urgent applications from affected inmates. Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, said: “If this is an emergency, it’s an emergency of this government’s making. The emergency is [the state] of the prison system where people come out more dangerous than they go in. “Unless [this change is] combined with a massive increase in resources it will not work and will be less defensible in legal terms because people will be deprived of even discretionary early release.”"
8,terror,UK to launch specialist cyber force able to target terror groups,"A specialist cyber force of hackers who can target hostile states and terror groups is due to be launched later in the spring, after many months of delays and turf wars between the Ministry of Defence and GCHQ. The National Cyber Force – containing an estimated 500 specialists – has been in the works for two years but sources said that after months of wrangling over the details, the specialist unit was close to being formally announced. Britain is keen to be seen as a “cyber power” able to disrupt against enemy states, targeting satellite, mobile and computer networks as well as trying to take down communications networks used by terror groups. The National Cyber Force is a joint initiative between the Ministry of Defence and GCHQ, and insiders said it would consolidate some existing capabilities as well as develop new ones. However, officials are coy on details, arguing that much of what the UK’s offensive hackers could do should remain classified. Nor is the identity of its leader expected to be publicly disclosed, although previous speculation that it would be a woman is understood to be inaccurate. Experts argue that the lack of clarity makes it difficult to discuss the appropriate limits of cyber warfare in a democracy and what sort of attacks or disruptive measures can be considered legitimate, particularly if there is a strong military dimension to its work. James Sullivan, the head of cyber research at defence thinktank Rusi, said: “There has been limited public debate on the purpose and ethics of offensive cyber, the circumstances under which it might be used, and the kinds of effects that might and might not be acceptable.” Avowed examples of British hacking are rare. Jeremy Fleming, GCHQ’s director, boasted in 2018 of conducting “a major offensive cyber campaign” against Isis, which he said “had significant success in suppressing [its] propaganda, hindered their ability to coordinate attacks, and protected coalition forces on the battlefield”. The spy chief claimed that during 2017, the terror group had “found it almost impossible to spread their hate online, to use their normal channels to spread their rhetoric, or trust their own publications” in a speech given at Nato in Brussels. Britain’s delayed efforts come on the heels of the US, which has been gradually acknowledging an expanded offensive cyber capability. Last summer, John Bolton, the then US national security adviser, acknowledged that Washington was broadening its operations after Donald Trump relaxed restrictions. The US also rarely acknowledges what its hackers do, although in one operation known as Synthetic Theology, the US Cyber Command jammed servers belonging to the Russian Internet Research Agency, in an apparent attempt to prevent Kremlin interference in the 2018 US mid-term elections. Fresh discussions about Britain’s offensive hacking capability come a day after Boris Johnson unveiled an integrated review of the UK’s foreign and defence policy, aimed at examining spending across all of the country’s UK security agencies over the next five years. But the last National Security review, in 2015, promised to “provide the armed forces with advanced offensive cyber capabilities”, although the final phase of that implementation has dragged on so long that it crossed over into the next review, which is due to complete in the autumn. No 10 has indicated that the review would not necessarily be cost-neutral, meaning that defence spending could increase beyond its existing level of 2% of GDP if an appropriate justification can be found. One of the issues it will address is the future balance of spending between conventional and cyber warfare."
9,terror,What we know so far about the Streatham terror attack," A man was shot dead by armed police in Streatham, south London, on Sunday afternoon. Police described the incident as “terrorist-related” and said that a number of people had been stabbed. At least three people were injured and taken to hospital. One is believed to be in a serious condition. The attacker is thought to have been wearing a fake suicide vest made of objects designed to look like an improvised explosive device. The attacker is believed by police to have been motivated by an Islamist terrorist ideology. Plain-clothes surveillance officers appear to have been in the area. An investigation will be carried out by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), as is required by law when police use lethal force. "
10,terror,When should journalists start calling an incident an act of terror?,"Just after 7am on 20 February, a reader emailed to say the Guardian had “made a massive error by calling the Hanau tragedy a shooting and not correctly calling it a terrorist attack”. At about 9pm GMT the night before, Tobias Rathjen had killed nine people at two shisha bars in Hanau, near Frankfurt, before killing his mother and then himself. “Why on earth has this not been described as a terrorist attack? To me this shows a racial bias,” wrote another reader mid-morning. The Centre for Media Monitoring, a project of the Muslim Council of Britain, also contacted me at lunchtime over what it described as the Guardian’s initial reluctance to call the attack terrorism. “While we understand that you may have been waiting for confirmation from the authorities, there appears to be enough evidence for it to be called an act of terror,” said the CfMM’s director, Rizwana Hamid. She said that Rathjen’s manifesto revealed white supremacist views; counter-terrorism police were investigating; and Peter Beuth, the interior minister for the state of Hesse, had said federal prosecutors were treating it as an act of domestic terror.    Not until it’s officially declared a terrorist incident would I call it that  Vikram Dodd, crime correspondent     The CfMM is concerned that British media are quicker to say terrorism “where the perpetrator is identified as being a so-called Muslim”. Senior editors to whom I spoke at the Guardian explained that the same process applied for all attacks; as a matter of responsible reporting they wait for authorities to declare an act as terrorism before adopting the term. The international editor, Jamie Wilson, points out that in the immediate aftermath, facts are often unclear and caution essential: he would rather be too slow to use the “terrorism” label than too quick and be wrong. The priority is reporting what is happening. Vikram Dodd, the Guardian’s crime correspondent, says that in the hours afterwards, he interprets language: “You may hear that counter-terrorism are ‘involved’ … then that they are ‘leading the investigation’, but not until it’s officially declared a terrorist incident would I call it that.” Early lines of inquiry can be fluid. Dodd recalls how a mass stabbing in Russell Square in London in 2016 was initially investigated with support from counter-terrorism officers but within hours a terrorist motive was discounted. In the case of Hanau, German authorities appear to have raised “suspicion of terrorism” at about 9am the next morning, although the chancellor, Angela Merkel, did not use the term when she spoke later of the “horrific murders” and their racist motive. The Guardian specifically referenced terrorism from about 5pm onwards, while the newspaper of 21 February would carry a double-page spread on the attack, calling it terror or terrorism in articles and headlines. In a span of coverage that exposed fully the horror of the Hanau attack, I do not believe any lag with terminology should be blamed on double standards – the threat from far-right terrorism is well understood – but on caution around uncertainty. Nevertheless, words carry weight and any perceived asymmetry of language deserves ongoing scrutiny. • Elisabeth Ribbans is the Guardian’s readers’ editor (guardian.readers@theguardian.com)"
11,terror,"Terror offenders should be jailed indefinitely if necessary, says Gove","Michael Gove has said some terrorism offenders should be jailed indefinitely “if necessary” as the government was warned that it faces legal challenges to emergency legislation proposed in the wake of the Streatham attack. The senior cabinet minister said “Islamist extremist terrorists” were in a different category to other offenders and must not be released until the Parole Board had deemed them safe to be on the UK’s streets. Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and a former justice secretary, told Sky News on Tuesday that offenders should be locked up indefinitely if necessary to protect the public. “We need to be able to prove that people are no longer a danger to the public. There is a big difference between those people who are Islamist extremist terrorists and those convicted of other offences. “If you have people in the grip of an ideology that means they want to kill innocent people in order to advance a particular religious or political view, they are a danger to society. Until they are comprehensively deradicalised and it is safe to have those people on our streets then public protection must come first.” He said the Parole Board would “look to see whether someone is genuinely safe” before terrorist prisoners could be released, in contrast to the current system under which offenders can be released automatically halfway through a sentence. The attacker in Streatham, Sudesh Amman, was under 24-hour surveillance by police after his automatic release midway through a sentence of three years and four months for a terrorism-related offence. However, experts have warned that applying legislation retrospectively to people already in prison would be challenged in the courts. Under the government plans, which would apply to both current and future offenders, prisoners who had committed terrorism offences would only be considered for release once they served two-thirds of their sentence and had undergone Parole Board risk assessments. Amman, who was sentenced in 2018 after pleading guilty to collecting and spreading terror material, had only been out of prison for 10 days before committing Sunday’s attack. Meanwhile, Usman Khan, who killed two people in a terror attack near London Bridge last November, had been released from jail on licence in 2018, halfway into a 16-year term for terrorism offences. Gove said the government would try to push through the emergency legislation this week. However, a former independent government reviewer of terrorism legislation, Alex Carlile, told the House of Lords on Monday that the proposals went too far. “The decision to lengthen the sentences of people who’ve already been sentenced and therefore expected to be serving half the sentence may be in breach of the law. It’s certainly going to be challenged,” Lord Carlile later told BBC Two’s Newsnight. “In any event, lengthening the sentence doesn’t solve the problem because those individuals are still going to have to come out of prison at some point.” Instead, Carlile urged the government to reintroduce tougher restrictions on released prisoners through control orders which were scrapped in 2011. Dominic Grieve QC, the former attorney general and ex-chairman of the intelligence and security committee, described the proposal as “rather problematic”. He told the Daily Telegraph: “I don’t think that retrospectively you can change the law for prisoners already in jail.” The human rights barrister Geoffrey Robertson QC described it as “panic legislation”. Responding to Carlile’s warning that the plans could be “in breach of law”, Gove said the new legislation would mean they were not. Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, indicated she was not against automatic release being replaced for those terror offenders sentenced in the future but said the “trickier question” was about those already jailed. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “For people who are going to be convicted and sentenced in the future, I think it would be hard in principle to object to automatic release being replaced with a discretionary release in the hands of an independent parole board. “The trickier question is … about people who’ve already been sentenced and the suggestion is when they were sentenced the judge knew they would be subject to automatic release at a certain point and now that will no longer be automatic. “It is obviously for the government to demonstrate that they’re proposing to change the administration of the sentence, rather than the sentence itself and they’re going to have to demonstrate that to the courts.” Asked if she would support that move, she replied: “I do not support changing people’s sentences but there is a grey area about what is the fundamental part of the sentence and what is the administration of the sentence and it’s really for the government to construct that to make it defensible in the court.” Amman’s ex-girlfriend has said Sunday’s attack had left her “shaking, traumatised, horrified”. The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said she endured psychological trauma while going out with Amman and that she felt trapped in their relationship, which lasted less than a year. Amman had urged his partner to murder her “disbeliever” parents and said any Muslims not supporting Islamic State were “apostates”. The disturbing details emerged in court in 2018 when Amman was jailed for possessing terrorist material. Now in her early 20s, his ex-girlfriend told ITV News: “He never hurt me physically, but emotionally and psychologically he did. “I felt trapped. I tried to deal with it by myself, but it affected me tremendously,” she said. “He seemed OK at first, but it quickly became apparent that things weren’t right.”"
12,terror,Streatham attacker freed from jail days ago after terror conviction,"The man shot dead by police after he stabbed two people in London on Sunday left prison only days ago and had previously been noted by police as having a “fascination with dying in the name of terrorism”, it has emerged. 
Sudesh Amman, whose attack on Streatham High Road left one person initially in a life-threatening condition, was under active police surveillance at the time of the attack. He had been freed after serving half of his sentence of more than three years for the possession and distribution of extremist material. 
Jailed aged 18 in December 2018, Amman had been released after serving part of his three year and four month sentence, but was deemed sufficiently high risk that he was under special monitoring by police.

Mobile phone footage of the incident showed officers wearing plain clothes arriving on the scene at high speed, firing about five gunshots and killing Amman outside a branch of the chemist Boots. They used pistols that are normally used by surveillance officers. 
Amid questions over how Amman was able to carry out the attack so soon after his release when he was being monitored so closely, a Whitehall source said: “He was under surveillance, that is what allowed police to do their job so quickly. It could have been much worse than it was. 
“There had been concerns when he was in prison but there were no powers for any authority to keep him behind bars. 
The attack is the second terror incident in the British capital in the past three months, coming soon after former terrorist prisoner Usman Khan stabbed and killed two people in the London Bridge terror attack in late November. 
Like Khan’s attack it will prompt further political debate about sentencing for terrorists. After an emergency meeting in Downing Street with Priti Patel, the home secretary, and senior police officers, Boris Johnson said: “[On Monday] we will announce further plans for fundamental changes to the system for dealing with those convicted of terrorism offences.” 
Amman, 20, pledged allegiance to Islamic State in messages to his girlfriend at the time he was jailed, and said that he wanted to carry out terrorist attacks. At the time, he wrote to her: “If you can’t make a bomb because family, friends or spies are watching or suspecting you, take a knife, molotov, sound bombs or a car at night and attack …”

Comments from police officers at the time suggested that there were serious concerns about the level of Amman’s determination to die as a martyr. At the time of his conviction, Acting Commander Alexis Boon, then head of the Metropolitan police counter terrorism command, said he had a “fierce interest in violence and martyrdom”. 
In remarks reported in 2018 Boon said: “His fascination with dying in the name of terrorism was clear in a notepad we recovered from his home. Amman had scrawled his ‘life goals’ in the notepad and top of the list, above family activities, was dying a martyr and going to ‘Jannah’ – the afterlife.” 
Boon continued: “It’s not clear how Amman became radicalised but it is apparent from his messages that it had been at least a year in development. Whatever the circumstances, this case is a reminder of the need to be vigilant to signs of radicalisation and report it.” 
A Whitehall source claimed that the attack was evidence that the prime minister should be able to enact harsher anti-terror laws. “There was nothing that could be done to keep him behind bars under existing laws, hence why he was under surveillance and strict licensing conditions,” the source said. 
In another echo of Khan’s attack, Amman was wearing a fake suicide vest, described by some eyewitnesses as containing canister-like objects. Police said they were able to establish quickly it was a hoax device after the attacker had been shot. 
Police and intelligence agencies only have resources to monitor a handful of individuals at one time, indicating that anybody under active surveillance will have been deemed to be a serious threat. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
Investigators’ inquiries will now focus on Amman’s associations, whether he was a lone actor or was directed by others, and, if they were being monitored, how the attacker managed to launch a stabbing spree in broad daylight. Investigators cautioned that it remained very difficult to establish exactly when a suspect’s intention turned into violent action. 
Eyewitnesses said they saw police fire several shots at the attacker. Karker Tahir, who worked in a nearby shop, said he saw “two or three police officers undercover with guns” telling the suspect to stop. “Then I saw them shoot him three times,” he added. 
Nardos Mulugeta, 52, a mechanical engineer who lives in Streatham, said he heard one shot, then a gap before three or four shots were fired. He described seeing three victims in the street including a woman who said she had been “stabbed in the back”. 
Two people were attacked on the high street, with police describing a man’s injuries as “life threatening” at the time. In total, three people were taken to south London hospitals, the Met later confirmed. One man’s condition is no longer life-threatening after treatment, a Met statement said; one woman with minor injuries has been discharged; and another woman is still being treated for minor injuries that police said were believed to have been caused by glass following the discharge of one of the officers’ firearms.

Police cordoned off the scene, closing down what is normally a busy shopping street and thoroughfare, with shoppers held back as paramedics attended. SThe incident happened so quickly that a double-decker bus that was driving past remained abandoned in the road as forensics investigators worked into the night. 
An immediate investigation into the shooting is also being undertaken by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. The watchdog said: “It is mandatory for us to conduct an independent investigation when the police fatally shoot a member of the public.”

13,terror,"Masked men, murder and mass displacement: how terror came to Burkina Faso","The road south towards Kaya is no longer safe, but thousands take it every day. They come on foot, piled on to scooters or next to donkeys straining at their carts. They testify to atrocities by masked men that are never claimed and whose motives remain unexplained. Women and children are everywhere. The men are looking for work, in hiding, or dead. A landlocked nation of 19 million people in the heart of west Africa, Burkina Faso was celebrated only a few years ago as a stable, vibrant young democracy. Now it is being eaten away at its eastern and northern fringes. Armed groups, including some aligned with al-Qaida and Islamic State, are waging a campaign of indiscriminate killing that has driven soldiers, teachers, health workers and other symbols of the state from vast swathes of the country’s borders. “We are at a point now where the very existence of the country is at stake,” says Zéphirin Diabré, the leader of the opposition party Union for Progress and Reform. “Officially, there is no location that has fallen to the terrorists,” says Jacob Yarabatioula, a sociologist at the University of Ouagadougou researching the violence. “But in reality, there are places at the extreme borders with Mali where you have no signs of the administration. No police, no gendarmerie, no defence forces, no schools. Those places are in a sense controlled by the terrorists.” In the past year, attacks on civilians have surged, triggering a tenfold increase in displaced people, whose numbers rival those of Syrians from Idlib and Myanmar’s Rohingya. According to official records, nearly 800,000 Burkinabè people had fled their homes as of 29 February. But not all are being registered, and aid groups say the real number is far greater. “If you look at the speed of arrivals and the lack of access for aid agencies and authorities to vast areas, there is no way the official figures are consistent,” says Tom Peyre-Costa from the Norwegian Refugee Council. “It’s highly probable that the figures are much, much higher.”     Burkina Faso is experiencing a fast-evolving displacement crisis. Photograph: Norwegian Refugee Council    Kaya, about a two-hour drive from the capital, Ouagadougou, is overwhelmed by the new arrivals. Outside one government office, more than 100 women gather in the red dirt jostling for bags of maize. “My family are sleeping on the ground over there,” says Aissetta Diaten, 56, pointing to a patch beneath a tree. The deadliest attacks – 35 people killed in a village in December, a church attack in February that left 24 dead, 43 villagers murdered last weekend – are usually publicised. But with more than 100 incidents recorded in February alone, according to one estimate, most of the violence experienced by the women lining up for food has gone unrecorded. “They kidnapped my son three months ago,” says one, who asks to be identified as Mamdata. “The men in the village ran before us, and we left later. I don’t even know where my husband is.” The fog extends to the perpetrators: the gunmen rarely identify themselves or claim their attacks later. Most are thought to be jihadists, including some affiliated with al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), who have spilled over or returned from neighbouring Mali, where they have been among the myriad actors involved in an eight-year insurgency. Several victims of attacks in different areas say the gunmen who arrived in their villages – always masked, sometimes wearing ammunition belts across their bodies – herded people into a local mosque to deliver coarse sermons about veiling women or cuffing pants above the ankle.   Burkina Faso map   “They said they were fighting for Islam and that everyone should follow Islam,” Shamim Suleyman, in his 80s, recalls of the men who arrived in his village near the northern town of Tongomayel. “And we said, ‘Look, we’re here in the mosque. We pray, we’re Muslims’. But if someone is carrying a gun and telling you these things, you can’t argue.” After gunmen shot Aruna, 27, during an attack on the village of Rofènéga in January, one of them asked if he could recite the shahadah, the Islamic profession of faith. “I could, I did,” he says, unbuttoning his shirt to reveal the scar tissue below his shoulder. “They took my phone and said I could leave.” Just how connected these groups are to Isis or al-Qaida’s leadership is unclear. Some might brand themselves as affiliates, receiving bomb-making help or funds, “but on the ground, west African groups do what they want and take advice as it makes sense”, says Judd Devermont, the director of the Africa Program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. Both the US military and local analysts have noted that groups aligned to Isis and al-Qaida appear to have launched joint attacks in Burkina Faso and elsewhere in the Sahel – even though the two terrorist organisations are bitter rivals in the Middle East. What is playing out in Burkina Faso and other pockets of the Sahel is more complex than a jihadist insurgency, analysts in the capital say. “At first it looked like terrorism,” Yarabatioula says. “But when we scratched the surface we noticed there were criminals involved too.”     Aruna shows the wound he sustained when he was shot by terrorists. Photograph: Michael Safi/The Guardian    As the state presence has diminished, especially in remote areas, local militias, highway robbers and smuggling gangs have proliferated. Some work with the jihadis and others fight them. When attacks occur, it is not always clear if they are motivated by an extremist interpretation of Islam, a local dispute or to win turf. “This is really a fight for a corridor,” says Yarabatioula. “These groups want to free a corridor to be able to smuggle drugs, cigarettes, and so on, going from Togo to Niger to Mali. And they are trying to create another corridor from western Burkina to the Ivory Coast.”   Related: The west ignores the growth of Islamist insurgents in Africa at its peril    “All these different groups are interested in the state going away,” says Mahamadou Sawadogo, a security researcher. “If there is no state, it’s good for all of them. That’s the link between them.” The success of the armed groups is not just down to an under-resourced Burkinabè army – now being supported by French troops. They are also expertly playing on discontent in rural areas, especially among the ethnic minority Fulani group, who often complain of discrimination and neglect by the central government. Many remote communities seethe at their lack of access to state resources, or when mines are granted to multinational companies and traditional hunting ranges are sold off as private estates, says Sawadogo. “The terrorist groups come and say, we will give you all that the state takes from you. They take control of the hunting ranges and tell people: take it, it’s for you. They take control of the local mines and tell them: use it, it’s yours. So why wouldn’t they succeed?” In contrast, the army’s efforts to beat back the militants have been marred by accusations of widespread human right abuses. “We’ve documented that 60 people were executed without trial last year,” says Aly Sanou, the secretary general of the Burkinabè Movement for Human and People’s Rights, a watchdog group based in Ouagadougou. “The population are not collaborating with the security forces, because in order to collaborate you need to trust them. Those from the Fulani ethnic group feel stigmatised, and this has allowed the terrorist groups to widen their recruitment base by recruiting more Fulanis.” The number of people registered as displaced is expected to exceed 900,000 by next month, with no end in sight. Aid agencies say at least $300m (£244m) in funding will be required to feed and shelter the fleeing population. Reaching those left behind in areas where government control has faltered is currently impossible, says Peyre-Costa. Nobody knows who to ask for safe passage. “In most humanitarian crises, we can negotiate access to be able to reach everyone in need,” he says. “But in the case of Burkina Faso, we don’t know who’s actually in control.” Additional reporting by Oumar Zombre"
14,terror,Government terror adviser warns 'no magic test' to stop reoffending,"The government’s adviser on terror legislation has warned that there is “no magic test” to determine the risks posed by a terrorist on release from prison, in further criticism of recently announced proposals to examine them with lie detectors. Jonathan Hall QC said in a speech that it was “impossible to guard against all risks” of violent reoffending and that any system which handed over release decisions to “risk experts” using polygraphs or any other method would be unacceptable. Speaking to the Henry Jackson Society, the legal expert said that “there is no magic test for risk at the point of release” and said that terror sentencing decisions made by trial judges should not be minimised in favour of alternatives. “There are also issues of principle here: a system in which length of sentence was entirely handed over to risk experts would be unacceptable,” Hall added. Hall was partly referring to Usman Khan, a terror offender who killed two in a frenzied knife attack near London Bridge in 11 November, 11 months after he had been released on licence, prompting a political row over whether he should have been let out. At the tail end of the election campaign, Boris Johnson, the prime minister, promised to implement a further crackdown on terrorism offenders. Full details were announced this week, dominated by the promise to introduce lie-detector testing. Lie-detector tests remain inadmissible in UK courts because of their unreliability. Many experts say while they can detect physiological changes, they are not scientifically validated as reliable measures that someone is lying. The Home Office also said it would insist that convicted terrorists serve their full term behind bars, although Hall warned that this pledge could only have a limited effect, given that those eligible for release had usually not committed violent acts. “Many terrorist offences are what we call precursor crimes (for example possession of a document, or providing funds to a proscribed group),” Hall said, which mean that their jail terms would be limited. “For this category of offenders the sentences will continue to be modest – so discussion of making terrorists serve their full sentences should not overlook the reality that many terrorists will be released sooner or later even if they do serve their full sentence.” Hall called for more research to prevent a repeat of cases such as Khan’s, saying in his speech that “what makes an individual progress from terrorism in its broadest sense to acts of violence is poorly understood”. MI5 and the counter-terror police should continue to evaluate and share information about convicted terrorists even after the end of formal investigations, Hall said, partly to see whether they re-engage in terrorist related activity. A growing number of terror offenders have been released from prison in recent years, having committed offences during the era when al-Qaida was the leading group, but Hall warned that the UK authorities may also be faced with similar decisions if British Isis prisoners currently held in Syria are eventually released. Hall, who was appointed last May, is given special access to secret national security information to carry out his task. Ministers appoint the independent reviewer to inform the public and political debate on anti-terrorism law in the UK. Hall was also named earlier this week to carry out a review of the way the police, MI5 and probation service investigate, monitor and manage terrorist offenders. The Ministry of Justice said there would be no role for polygraph testing in sentencing decisions made by trial judges in terror cases. Lie detectors are to be introduced to help determine when terror offenders should ultimately be released."
15,terror,Germany's Muslims call for protection after 'far-right terror plot' arrests,"Muslim communities in Germany have called for more police protection after the arrest of members of a rightwing extremist group that is believed to have been plotting large-scale attacks on mosques around the country. Twelve men who were arrested following police raids on Friday had been planning attacks using semi-automatic weapons on worshippers during prayers in 10 German states, said to have been inspired by those carried out in New Zealand last year, according to a government spokesman. Investigators had been following the men for months, monitoring their conversations and online activity, after suspecting them of having formed a terror group. They eavesdropped on a meeting in North Rhine-Westphalia earlier this month in which the alleged ringleader, 53-year-old Werner S, outlined the group’s concrete plans for “commandos” to attack Muslims in small communities across the country. Two of the men were elected to acquire weapons, and all members were expected to contribute towards a €50,000 (£42,000) fund to finance the operation. German prosecutors spoke of the planned attacks as “mosque massacres” inspired by the attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in spring 2019, in which 51 people were killed by a gunman. According to the men’s discussions, the attacks were intended to provoke revenge attacks and to evolve into a civil war, authorities said. Four of the arrested men are being treated as suspected terrorists, eight as accomplices, including an administrative police clerk. The plot came to light after a police informer managed to infiltrate the group. Björn Grünewälder, the interior ministry spokesman, said while there was relief that the plot had been foiled, he was alarmed by the speed in which the group had formed. “It’s shocking what has come to light here, and that there are cells which appear to have become radicalised in a very short length of time,” he said. Angela Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, insisted the government was committed to protecting religious groups. “It is the task of the state and naturally of this government, to protect the free practice of religion in this country, regardless of what religion that might be,” he said. “Anyone practising their religion in Germany within our legal framework should be able to do so without being endangered or threatened,” Seibert added. Police had raided homes of the would-be attackers early on Friday morning, aware that they might already have acquired weapons. An attack last June on Walter Lübcke, a conservative local politician who had spoken out in defence of refugees, and the October attack on a synagogue in the eastern city of Halle have made German authorities increasingly aware of the threat of rightwing extremist crime. Police are watching the activities of 53 men and women associated with the extreme right, who they say are capable of carrying out violence. In 2016, it was 22. Der Spiegel reported that the group had formed last autumn, the majority of them meeting at an old saw mill in Baden-Württemberg, where the discussion focused on weaponry and how to obtain it. Werner S, who was nicknamed Teutonico by the group, tried to recruit like-minded men who he said had to be “intelligent, hard, brutal and fast”. He talked about wanting to build an underground army, modelled on the so-called Freikorps or free corps – the irregular German military volunteer units, which existed from the 18th century but were at their most powerful in the early 1900s fighting on behalf of the government against Soviet-backed German communists during the Weimar Republic. Police investigators said to what extent the men just talked, and to what extent their intentions might have been realised, would be revealed during their investigation. Among the finds during the raids was a 9mm pistol and ammunition at Werner S’s house. At other properties they seized homemade egg-shaped hand grenades, axes, crossbows, spiked maces and several knives. The group had intended to acquire “slam guns” as used by the antisemitic attacker in Halle. In their discussions, according to Spiegel, the men had used the codeword “electro-scooters” to describe the weapons, and referred to the accompanying munition as “batteries”. The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany, Aiman Mazyek, said the planned attacks were “very alarming” and called for more security at the country’s mosques. He told the Berlin daily Taz: “Without state protection, the situation is getting ever more dangerous. What are the security authorities waiting for?” Mohammad Dawood Majoka, a spokesman for the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, called for an “increased attentiveness by the police”. Zekeriya Altuğ, a spokesman for Ditib, the umbrella organisation for a large number of mosques in Germany, said the arrests highlighted “the seriousness of the situation … the point of no return is getting ever closer,” he said. Taz said investigators had allegedly made links between Werner S and the hard-right populist Alternative für Deutschland party, after finding his email address on an AfD contact list. But an AfD spokesman told the paper it had “never at any point in time” been in contact with Werner S, and had no connection to him. He was also friends on Facebook with an AfD functionary from Saxony-Anhalt."
16,terror,Extinction Rebellion listed as 'key threat' by counter-terror police,"A police force in London labelled Extinction Rebellion one of its “key threats” in a counter-terrorism assessment and provided awareness training on the climate crisis group across the capital, resulting in “intelligence” tip-offs. City of London police grouped the environmental protest movement alongside “far-right organisations” in an assessment of its counter-terrorism operations seen by the Guardian. The report provides further evidence that Extinction Rebellion has become of interest to counter-terrorism police after the Guardian revealed that the group was included in anti-radicalisation materials alongside violent far-right and jihadist groups. Provided to a scrutiny committee of the City of London Corporation, the report detailed the police force’s performance against different measures including “the capability and impact the force is having against countering terrorist activity”. In a detailed summary of its performance in countering terrorism, the report said: “The force has continued close liaison (which has included the dissemination of intelligence) with partners and pan-London agencies regarding the key threats, particularly with regard to far-right organisations and Extinction Rebellion. “CTSAs (counter-terrorism security advisers) have delivered Action Counter Terrorism (ACT) awareness training across the City, including bespoke presentations to organisations. This has resulted in an increase in intelligence being submitted to the force by ACT-trained security personnel.” The report was discussed at a hearing of the scrutiny committee in June last year. Another paragraph said: “The key issues continue to be threats relating to international terrorism and domestic terrorism. In addition, the high-profile actions of Extinction Rebellion, which centred around non-violent disobedience, results in some disruption in the City, with the potential for the event to be hijacked or infiltrated by more extremist groups.” Paul Stephens, an Extinction Rebellion member and former Metropolitan police detective sergeant, said on behalf of the movement: “With each new example revealed by the Guardian, the categorisation of Extinction Rebellion with terrorist groups looks more like a strategy to encourage intelligence gathering than an error and is in complete contradiction to the words of counter-terrorism policing. It is an obvious and unethical tactic which could lose the trust of valued sources. “We will never knowingly mislead the police, so why not speak to us directly? I hope that the gravity of this emergency and the need for communication and cooperation is understood.”  A City of London police spokesperson said: “City of London police does not consider Extinction Rebellion to be a terrorist organisation. Ahead of the protests in the summer, our officers, who have regular contact with businesses in the area, spoke to them to ask them to consider the impact of the protests on their business continuity, and to make plans accordingly.” The Guardian revealed this month that Extinction Rebellion had been placed on a list of extremist ideologies that should be reported to authorities running the Prevent programme. Last week it was revealed that Greenpeace, Peta and other non-violent groups were included in a counter-terrorism police document distributed to medical staff and teachers as part of anti-extremism briefings. Police chiefs said any such advice was issued by Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE) in the south-east of England and not in any other part of the UK, and they branded it an “error of judgment” and vowed to recall the guidance. City of London falls under a separate division of the CT policing network, Counter Terrorism Command (SO15), along with the Metropolitan police. The Guardian has since heard from teachers and council workers across the country who have received Prevent training that referenced Extinction Rebellion. A teacher from south London described a Prevent training session held at her school by a Home Office official, organised by the borough council last September. As part of the training, she was shown an image of a bag with an XR badge affixed. She told the Guardian: “The specialist went through five or six different groups – there was far right, Islamism, they were all things I’d seen before. The one that did stand out was Extinction Rebellion and climate protesting.” A council housing officer whose borough falls within the counter-terrorism policing east region said two police officers provided a Prevent training session to staff in June last year in which they included Extinction Rebellion. “I was unable to concentrate for the rest of the session as I was so shocked by the appearance of Extinction Rebellion,” they said. A teacher at a college in the Midlands said they were in a induction session in November last year, a large part of which was given over to a representative from a West Midlands counter-terrorism unit. “For the most part she focused on rightwing threats but there was one slide that detailed some alt-right extremist groups alongside XR and surprisingly, Greenpeace,” they said. “It is entirely inappropriate that XR be considered a terrorist threat or even a group that is to be monitored. Doing so diminishes the threat from other groups and also utterly negates XR’s agenda of challenging climate change.” In the north-west, evidence emerged of a Prevent interest in stickers advocating anti-fascism and tougher action on climate change, with images of the stickers circulated to council managers. One questioned why such causes were being included in Prevent’s work and lodged a complaint in late December 2018."
17,terror,"Six terrorists convicted of further terror act after release, data shows","Six convicted terrorists have been released from prison and convicted of a further terrorist offence within seven years, it has been revealed, as parliament heads into a debate over emergency laws designed to keep extremist prisoners in jail for longer. Between January 2013 and December 2019, 196 individuals convicted of a terrorist offence were released from prison in England and Wales with 3.06% of them going on to be convicted of a further terrorist offence. The figures, which were released to Lord Anderson, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, through a written question to the government, come as parliament is set to debate emergency legislation announced less than 24 hours after the convicted terrorist Sudesh Amman stabbed two people in south London. The proposals, which the government hopes to rush through parliament in a single day, will block the automatic release of about 50 serving terrorist prisoners at the halfway point of their sentences. Human rights experts have said applying a change in the conditions of a sentence retrospectively is potentially unlawful and that the figures uncovered by Anderson are further evidence of a kneejerk response by the government. Raj Chada, a partner and human rights specialist at Hodge Jones &amp; Allen Solicitors, said: “The rate of reoffending hardly merits the junking of basic principles of the rule of law and human rights. This is not evidenced-based policymaking, but panic-induced populism.” The reoffending figures do not include Amman, nor Usman Khan, the convicted terrorist who killed two people in London Bridge in November, as they were shot dead, nor does it include those whose terrorist criminality is yet to be detected. Raffaello Pantucci​, a senior associate fellow at Rusi, an independent international defence and security thinktank, said: “There is always the complicating factor of people being convicted on other charges, but even if you throw in some mitigating factors like that for the data, it does certainly suggest that just using sentence extension as an answer might not be dealing with the problem. “These figures suggest that there are quite a few former terrorist offenders out there who have not gone back into terrorist activity, and we have not really been presented with the case that all of those who are currently inside are completely different to this previous cohort. “There are clearly some very dangerous terrorist offenders sitting in the UK’s jails, and we need to find ways of managing them. But our response needs to be focused on them, and separate them out from those who pose less of a risk, rather than simply grouping them all together.” The government faced immediate accusations of developing policy on the hoof and ignoring the crisis in prisons when it unveiled the emergency legislation last week. Critics have asked for more focus to be placed on rehabilitation behind bars rather than the length of sentences. Answering on behalf of the government, Lord Keen, the House of Lords spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice, said: “All those convicted of an offence under the Terrorism Act who have been released on probation are closely managed by the National Probation Service. “HMPPS works closely with law enforcement partners to share information and manage the risks that these offenders present in custody and on probation to reduce the risk of reoffending, and to support them to reintegrate into the community."
18,terror,Terror police's Extinction Rebellion 'risk report' sent out a year ago,"Counter-terrorism chiefs ordered a formal assessment of whether Extinction Rebellion was a national security threat one year ago and then sent a secret report about the group to police forces, the Guardian has learned. The revelation shows that counter-terrorism police’s interest in the non-violent climate emergency group began earlier and was more extensive than previously thought. Police insist that the confidential assessment, which was titled Rising Up, concluded that XR was not a terrorist or extremist threat, and was sent to regional counter-terrorism units and “policing partners”. They have declined to give any more detail about what it covered. The document from the Counter Terrorism Policing’s National Operations Centre (CTPNOC) was marked as sensitive and produced in February 2019, soon after XR was formed in October 2018. It was needed, police say, because the group was attracting a “large following” and counter-terrorism specialists needed to assess their “goals and methods”. The Guardian first revealed that a counter-terrorism document from November 2019 labelled XR as extremist last month, which police apologised for and withdrew only after its existence was made public. Then revelations about CTP documents from June 2019, titled “Signs and Symbols”, listing XR and other peaceful groups such as Greenpeace and Peta, alongside banned terrorists and extremists, caused anger and claims from activists that freedom of protest and thought were being threatened. The non-violent groups were alarmed to discover that the documents had been circulated as part of Prevent briefings for teachers and medical staff, to help them spot people at risk of falling into terrorism. Both leading Labour politicians and one Conservative heavyweight have voiced their concerns. The Guardian further understands that Counter Terrorism Policing headquarters (CTPHQ) produced documents about non-violent protest groups.  An Extinction Rebellion spokesperson said: “We all agree public safety is paramount. However, if CTP is used as a blunt instrument, it is a threat to human rights. “We are concerned about how far, how long and how intrusive this investigation might have been and the ongoing implications. We would request that the police make this top secret Rising Up report available to the public alongside any other reports.” Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP recently re-elected as chair of the home affairs select committee, said: “Following the recall of CTP guidance on Extinction Rebellion last month, we need to know whether this report that was circulated to police forces across the country also contained wrong information or categorisation. “We need to know whether the Home Office has seen this report and if they have taken any necessary actions. They need to show leadership and responsibility on this so the public can maintain confidence in the crucially important counter-terror work the police do.” After police were contacted about the document, the UK’s senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism, deputy assistant commissioner Dean Haydon, decided to explain counter-terrorism police’s interest in XR. Speaking to the Guardian, Haydon said that producing Rising Up was the right thing to do: “When a protest group is gaining influence and beginning to attract a large following, it is necessary for policing to assess that group’s goals and methods to see whether they pose a security threat or are at risk of attracting extremists who might be a threat to the public. This also provides forces with important information that can help them facilitate peaceful protest. “Because of our national remit and access to information from across the UK via all 43 police forces, Counter Terrorism Policing has been in a unique position to produce this guidance. We did so in the case of Extinction Rebellion, and as we have already said, we do not consider them to be a counter-terrorism risk.” He added: “That’s an assessment that’s been produced internally for CT professionals.” On the Signs and Symbols document, Haydon said he regretted any offence, and offered to meet peaceful groups offended by their inclusion. He said it and other CTP documents would be amended, but not withdrawn: “We’re updating and refreshing it. And then secondly, if certain groups are in there, if it has caused offence, then we are reaching out to those groups to come and have a conversation with us, so we can explain the wider context.” Protest groups suspect and fear unwarranted police interest in them. The revelations this month have only fanned those longstanding concerns. Rosalind Comyn, from Liberty, said: “Knowing that any one of us could be treated as a possible national security threat if we engage in activism acts as a deterrent to us speaking out against the state, and that is deeply worrying. These actions threaten the traditions of activism and peaceful protest we have always used to protect our rights and stand up to power.” Haydon said CTP had to have an interest in public order issues and would continue to do so, because groups such as National Action and al-Muhajiroun had started on the street with demonstrations then morphed into terrorist threats. Both are now banned. But the counter-terrorism chief, the second most senior in the UK, said he wanted to get out of the business of producing guides on groups for mainstream policing dealing with protest groups.  Haydon said: “So what we’re doing at the moment is transferring responsibility for public order matters lock, stock and barrel into mainstream policing. That’s going to take some time. So Signs and Symbols documents, policy and some of the other stuff we do that I’ve explained are moving to mainstream policing.” He said police chiefs from every force in England and Wales, as well as from counter-terrorism policing, met after the Guardian’s revelations.  One force that received a copy of Rising Up was Police Scotland, the second biggest force in the UK. One source said it had been “copied and pasted” and used as the basis for briefings on XR for its local Contest liaison officers (LCLOs), who deliver the Prevent programme to schools and others. Contest is the name for the government’s counter-terrorism strategy. The briefings are revealed in Police Scotland reports written for Angus council and Dundee city council. One report reads: “Extinction Rebellion briefings were provided to local Contest liaison [police] officers in Angus. Extinction Rebellion (XR) is a UK-born international movement, which aims for nothing less than global civil disobedience to pressure governments across the world to act on climate breakdown and species extinctions.” Chf Supt Andrew Todd, Police Scotland’s divisional commander for Tayside, said: “Our Contest liaison officers provide advice to partners on a whole range of issues, some of which are not related to terrorism.”  Additional reporting by Russell Scott"
19,terror,Greenpeace included with neo-Nazis on UK counter-terror list,"A counter-terrorism police document distributed to medical staff and teachers as part of anti-extremism briefings included Greenpeace, Peta and other non-violent groups as well as neo-Nazis, the Guardian has learned. The guide, produced by Counter Terrorism Policing, is used across England as part of training for Prevent, the anti-radicalisation scheme designed to catch those at risk of committing terrorist violence. Last week, police said documents uncovered by the Guardian that listed the environmental protest group Extinction Rebellion (XR) alongside far-right extremists and jihadists were a local error. But the list of groups viewed as a potential concern contained in the new 24-page document includes Extinction Rebellion. It also includes Greenpeace – among whose supporters are Dame Judi Dench, Stephen Fry, Gillian Anderson and Joanna Lumley – and the ocean pollution campaigners Sea Shepherd, whose supporters include Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan. Also included is Stop the Badger Cull, which is backed by Sir Brian May, the Queen guitarist. They appear alongside a number of extremist rightwing groups including Combat 18 and the National Front, as well as National Action, which has been banned for terrorist violence. The last page of an accompanying visual guide seen by the Guardian advises people to report “any concerns identified via this document” using an online portal for reporting suspicious activity that is operated by Counter Terrorism Policing under the slogan: “Action counters terrorism”.     A section from the visual guide to the Counter Terrorism Policing document showing an aid to identifying rightwing signs and symbols. Photograph: Home Office    Police insist the guide is not meant to portray all the groups that it features as extremist and thus needing to be reported to them. They said it is meant to boost understanding of the signs and symbols people may come across, and point to a statement in the document that “not all of the signs and symbols noted within this document are of counter terrorism interest”. However, on the visual guide the disclaimer appears to refer specifically to a set of religious and historical symbols used by white supremacists including “Odin’s Rune’, “SS Runes” and “Thor’s Hammer”. Mainstream leftwing and environmental groups are not similarly marked. Non-violent groups featured in the document were furious at their inclusion. “Tarring environmental campaigners and terrorist organisations with the same brush is not going to help fight terrorism,” said John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK. “It will only harm the reputation of hard-working police officers … How can we possibly teach children about the devastation caused by the climate emergency while at the same implying that those trying to stop it are extremists?” Peta’s director, Elisa Allen, said: “This appears to be a sinister attempt to quash legitimate campaigning organisations – something that is as dangerous as it is undemocratic.” A spokesman for Extinction Rebellion said: “The guidance document makes it clear that not all the signs and symbols are of counter-terrorism interest. However, if that’s the case, why include them in a counter-terrorism document?”     Environmental groups and symbols in the visual guide. Photograph: skridb    Politicians were also critical of the document, with Labour leadership candidate Lisa Nandy called the inclusion of peaceful climate crisis groups “absolute nonsense”. Among the groups listed with no known link to terrorist violence or known threat to national security are Stop the War, the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, vegan activists, anti-fascist groups, anti-racist groups, an anti-police surveillance group and campaigners against airport expansion. Communist and socialist political parties are also on the list. They feature alongside numerous groups associated with the ideology of violence of the far right, and the terrorist group National Action, which is proscribed, as well as two other banned groups. There are also a set of symbols and tattoos commonly associated with white supremacy, from a swastika and a “white pride worldwide” poster to tattoos of an iron eagle and the second world war German general Erwin Rommel. The guide, from June 2019, bears the logo of Counter Terrorism Policing on every page, and was presented in briefings to public sector workers.     The Queen guitarist Brian May leads a protest march in 2015 against the killing of badgers. Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA Archive/PA Images    One senior teacher, who supports the efforts to thwart radicalisation, said they received the document as part of Prevent training at their educational establishment: “The document was given with the guidance that teaching staff could use it to identify symbols that students might draw or have about them and to enable staff to make a decision about whether it is a Prevent concern or not. “The document is extraordinarily vague and leaves a great deal down to the interpretation of the individual member of staff,” the teacher added. “Clustering relatively innocuous groups like Greenpeace and CND in with genuine extremist groups seems to imply that these organisations are on the radar of the counter-terrorism police and should also be interpreted as such by the teaching staff coming across them.” Police said it was “unhelpful and misleading” to suggest non-violent groups in the document were being smeared. They said it would be provided to Prevent partners as “a guide to help them identify and understand the range of organisations they might come across” and should not be viewed as suggesting that membership of “non-proscribed groups would be sufficient to trigger a Prevent referral”.     The visual guide from the Counter Terrorism Policing document.   “Our focus is definitely not on lawful protest, or legitimate causes taken up by activists across the country,” Counter Terrorism Policing’s senior national coordinator, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon told the Guardian. Dated June last year, the document was sent to doctors, schools and safeguarding children boards as a resource for practitioners of Prevent. A spokesman for Worcestershire Acute NHS Trust said the documents were available for staff to access as part of Prevent awareness. The documents were supplied to the trust’s safeguarding and Prevent lead. It is also in use in the West Midlands. Last week, police claimed it was an error for a guide explicitly about extremism to include Extinction Rebellion alongside terrorist-supporting Islamist and extreme rightwing groups. They further said such an approach in the guide meant for police, teachers and other public sector workers was limited to the south-east of England. After the Guardian revealed the guide’s existence it was recalled. Clare Collier, advocacy director at Liberty, said the latest document was evidence that peaceful protest was under threat. “We have long warned that the government’s counter-terror agenda is one of the greatest threats to free speech in the UK. If you are passionate about anything from climate change to social justice or fighting racism in the UK today you risk being labelled extremist and your details being passed to the police. “The UK’s counter-terror measures are designed to co-opt public sector workers like teachers to spy on young people in their care – this guide will only add to the confusion and pressures they face. It also reinforces long held concerns that the government’s staggeringly broad definition of extremism gives the police cover to characterise non-violent political activity as a threat, and monitor and control any community they wish.” Additional reporting by Russell Scott"
20,terror,Ex-Prevent chief pans terror list's inclusion of Extinction Rebellion,"The official scheme to stop people becoming terrorists risks being damaged by scandals such as listing Extinction Rebellion as an extremist ideology, a former senior police chief has said. 
Sir Peter Fahy, who was head of Prevent from 2010 to 2015, said confidence from communities was vital to its success and legitimacy. 
He was speaking after the Guardian revealed police had branded the nonviolent climate emergency group as an extremist ideology in a guide designed to help stop terrorist violence. 
The publication produced by counter-terrorism police in the south-east showed police had placed XR on a list of ideologies alongside neo-Nazis and Islamist extremists that should be reported to the authorities running the Prevent anti-radicalisation programme. 
Fahy, a former chief constable of Greater Manchester police, said: “Prevent is about stopping terrorist acts against people or property and XR is not in that territory at all. 
“XR is about lawful protest and disruption to get publicity – it is very different from terrorist acts.” 
The guide was sent to police officers, teachers and others in government. Police said they had since recalled the document and that including XR was an error. 
 
  
  
   
    What is Prevent?
    
    Prevent is one of the four “Ps” of the government’s counter-terrorism strategy, along with Pursue, Protect and Prepare. It was created by the Labour government in 2003 and its remit was widened by the coalition government in 2011.
    Its stated purpose is to safeguard and support those vulnerable to radicalisation and to stop them from becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism.
    
    How does it prevent people from becoming terrorists?
    
    Individuals suspected of being vulnerable to radicalisation can be referred to police for further assessment. One of the most controversial aspects of Prevent was the statutory duty introduced in 2015 on schools, NHS trusts, prisons and local authorities to report concerns about people who may be at risk of turning to extremism or terrorism.
    Once referred, the individual will be assessed to see whether or not further intervention is required. If an individual is assessed to be vulnerable to radicalisation, they may be offered support through the Channel programme in England and Wales, or the Prevent Professional Concerns (PPC) programme in Scotland. This is a voluntary process.
    Between 2017 and 2018, a total of 7,318 individuals were subject to a referral but only 394 were escalated to the Channel process.
    
    Why is Prevent controversial?
    
    The most common criticism levelled at the Prevent strategy is that it&nbsp;disproportionately impacts people of Muslim faith&nbsp;or background and inhibits legitimate expression.
    There have been numerous reports over the last 15 years that have fuelled this perception: an eight-year-old questioned by Prevent after his teachers mistook his T-shirt slogan for Islamic State propaganda, a 17-year-old referred because he wore a “Free Palestine” badge to school and a student of counter-terrorism questioned after an official spotted him reading a&nbsp;textbook entitled Terrorism Studies.
    The Prevent brand has been labelled “toxic” in parts of the Muslim community. But senior policing and security figures continue to back Prevent. In September 2019 the UK’s most senior counter-terrorism officer,&nbsp;Neil Basu, vigorously defended the programme in a speech in Israel, while security ministers and former home secretaries have insisted it has saved lives.
    Jamie Grierson,&nbsp;Home affairs correspondent
    
   
  
  
 
Fahy said confidence in Prevent was crucial to its success in stopping the flow of terrorists, and risked being damaged by the inclusion of the nonviolent group in the guide. ”It is clearly disappointing,” he said. “Prevent has to be about safeguarding people from becoming involved in terrorism. 
“Prevent does depend on having the confidence of communities, and for instance of teachers because you need them to have confidence they can feed in information and it will be used proportionately. Unfortunately, this does risk damaging confidence in Prevent.“ 
Lawyers for XR will write to police on Monday demanding the guide is withdrawn, not just recalled, and asking for details about whether anyone was referred to Prevent as a result of it being issued. 
Tobias Garnett, from XR’s legal strategy team, said: “Our lawyers are requesting that this guidance be formally withdrawn and any referrals of individuals to Prevent reversed. 
“It is patently absurd to put a nonviolent movement of people urging the government to take action on the climate and ecological emergency on a list of extremist ideologies. This is not extremism, it is level-headedness in the face of scientific consensus and fires that now rage from Australia to the Amazon.” 
The challenge to the authorities from XR comes from its campaigns of civil disobedience and its popularity among the young. The Guardian revealed in October that police and government were in talks to acquire tougher powers against XR. 
One senior police source said police were under pressure from the government, which was annoyed by the disruption such protests cause, and said ministers and officials wanted to see more robust and proactive action.  
“They want ‘move forward’ tactics and to see the police are doing something and clearing the streets. Government wants police to be more robust earlier and more often,” the source said. 
A Metropolitan police ban on XR protests was ruled unlawful last year. 
In July a pamphlet by the rightwing thinktank Policy Exchange, which has been influential in Conservative party thinking and policy, branded XR as extreme and called for a tougher crackdown on its protests. Both of the thinktank’s key demands did, to some extent, happen. 
It was co-authored by a former Scotland Yard counter-terrorism chief, Richard Walton, and ended its 70-page attack by saying: “To date, there has been a marked failure to call out this extremist agenda for what it is.”"
21,terror,Preacher who inspired Streatham terror attack peddling jihad from behind bars,"Hundreds of sermons preached by the Islamist cleric who inspired the men who carried out the terrorist attacks in Streatham and on London Bridge in November are available on a website that allows his followers to communicate in private chatrooms, the Observer has established.   Related: Junior police ‘must make split second decisions on terrorists’    Abdullah al-Faisal, who was born into an evangelical Christian family in Jamaica and spent many years in Britain, has become one of the most successful propagandists for al-Qaida and Islamic State. Sudesh Amman, 20, who was shot dead by police last week after coming out of prison for terrorism offences, had copies of Faisal’s speeches, the Times reported. The newspaper also said that Usman Khan, 28, who fatally stabbed two Cambridge graduates near London Bridge last November, had the cleric’s number in his mobile phone when he was arrested over his links to a plot to bomb the London Stock Exchange in December 2010. Others influenced by Faisal include the shoe bomber Richard Reid; at least two of the 7/7 bombers – Mohammad Sidique Khan and Germaine Lindsay; Dhiren Barot, who was jailed for trying to blow up the New York Stock Exchange; the University College London student Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried to blow up an aircraft on Christmas Day 2009; and Mohammed Chowdhury, who was part of a cell that sought to assassinate Boris Johnson and two rabbis. Although Faisal is under arrest in Jamaica, awaiting extradition to the US on terrorism charges, his influence endures. In December two sympathisers were convicted for spreading his speeches by publishing them on a website called Authentic Tauheed. Some of the speeches glorified terrorist organisations including al-Qaida and Isis and encouraged listeners to commit or prepare for acts of terrorism, the Old Bailey heard. They also earned Faisal money. Last year a follower in Singapore was jailed for sending Faisal $1,145 after being inspired by his sermons, which he had accessed online. The website carries more than 700 of Faisal’s sermons, something that experts trying to combat Islamist narratives say presents society with acute challenges. “This is an ideological battle and he is offering views which need to be countered,” said Dr Paul Stott, research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society. “We can’t censor or hide this stuff away. Once it exists on PDF or video it’s never going to be completely erased.” The Authentic Tauheed website supports a platform called Paltalk that allows users to communicate in private. “This needs to be taken down; this is dangerous,” said Haras Rafiq, CEO of Quilliam, the counter-extremism thinktank, who said the site also hosted speeches from Anwar al-Awlaki, an al-Qaida recruiter who was killed in a US drone strike in 2011. Faisal was not considered a threat when he started preaching in the UK about the turn of the millennium.    He's offering a polarised world view … He gave people answers  Dr Paul Stott, researcher     “Some of that goes back to the way in Britain we respond to things that we are not sure about,” Stott said. “Often we joke about it or almost dismiss it.” Stott said, Faisal’s appeal was based on three factors. “One, he was a convert; two, his colour – he was black and he could reach out to people who were unhappy with their status; three, he’d been to Saudi Arabia and studied there. He had that degree of legitimacy that perhaps somebody born and brought up in the UK didn’t have.” Faisal, who was born Trevor William Forrest, was jailed in the UK in 2003 for three counts related to soliciting murder and for stirring up racial hatred. He was released in 2007 and deported to Jamaica but he has continued to inspire younger followers, including in Kenya where he has spent some time. A dossier compiled by the Anti-Defamation League suggests that he has used the Syrian conflict to groom the next generation of western youth into supporting Isis. Before his most recent arrest he regularly took to Twitter to praise the terrorist organisation claiming “any Mujahid [fighter] who doesn’t give his bayah [allegiance] to Dawla [Islamic State]is a fake Jihadi and his death will be in vain”. In 2014 Faisal gave a lecture describing Isis’s creation of the caliphate as the fulfilment of a prophecy. “He’s offering a very polarised world view,” Stott said. “Removing Faisal from the country doesn’t seem to have stopped him having some influence. He gave people answers.” In 2017 the ADL reported that Authentic Tauheed has published nearly 200 posts on topics that it considers are “antisemitic, anti-Christian, anti-American and anti-gay, to blatant endorsements of the Islamic State”, most of them from Faisal."
22,terror,UK may bypass human rights convention  to rush through terror laws,"Britain could temporarily separate itself from the European convention on human rights (ECHR) in order to push through emergency laws on sentencing for terrorists in the wake of the London Bridge and Streatham attacks. Ministers want to ban convicted terrorists from being automatically released halfway through their prison term as soon as possible following Sunday’s incident in south London. It was the second case in just over two months of a freed prisoner committing further terror offences. On Tuesday, a government spokesman did not rule out derogating from the ECHR to try to put the new laws in place and said the legislation could be introduced in the next few days. The possible move could be the first major test of Britain’s relationship with Europe’s legal institutions on human rights following Brexit, and comes before a review the Conservative party has said it wants to carry out into the country’s human rights laws. On whether the country derogates from the ECHR, the prime minister’s official spokesman said: “We are going to ensure that we will bring forward the necessary legislation to protect the public because that is the right thing to do.” Asked again if the government would deviate from ECHR rulings to bring in the fast-tracked laws, he said: “As the justice secretary said, we believe that we can bring forward this legislation and we are committed to doing so.” In his only head-on acknowledgement of the organisation’s role in UK law, he said: “We are signatories to the ECHR.” The shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, said allowing speculation over the ECHR’s influence to continue was a ploy to give Tory party members anti-European “red meat”. The Labour peer said: “So what are we to believe in this new Trumpian politics? And what is their motive? This is red meat to their right wing.” There are 224 terrorist offenders in prison, four of whom are due for early release in March, according to an analysis by the Henry Jackson Society thinktank. Three of those were due for automatic release and could be affected by the legislation. They include Mohammed Ghani from Barnet, north London, who in 2019 was sentenced to 28 months for four offences including threatening to kill police officers in a call to 999 and possessing the Isis propaganda magazine Inspire. Another is Mohammed Zahir Khan, a corner-shop owner from Sunderland, who was sentenced for four years and six months in May 2018 for nine counts of distributing Isis propaganda via a Twitter account and calling for “death to Shia” Muslims. The third is Mohammed Khilji from Brent, north-west London, who was jailed in June 2018 for five years on eight counts of encouraging terrorism, by sharing graphic videos of Isis beheadings and videos calling for violence against non-Muslims. Each is currently eligible for release at the halfway point of their sentence, with the time served discounted for time on remand. The human rights group Liberty said it believed that the government’s proposals were at risk of being struck down by a legal challenge, because they were in apparent breach of article 7 of the ECHR. That states “No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed.” Martha Spurrier, the director of the pressure group, writing in the Guardian in a forthcoming comment piece, warned: “Everyone – including convicted criminals of course – has a right to serve the prison sentence they were given when they were tried by an independent judge.” Other legal experts said that they believed that ministers would be able to see off any legal challenge. “The new provisions are likely to survive legal challenge so long as they do not change the total sentence, but just the arrangements for how it is to be served,” said Lord Anderson, a former independent reviewer of terror legislation. “The courts both in the UK and in Strasbourg and have been quite pragmatic about this in similar cases in the past,” he added. The UK can choose to depart from the ECHR in limited circumstances, specifically in times of emergency, war or “threat to life of the nation” under article 15 of the ECHR. On whether the government considers the current situation an emergency, the spokesman said: “That’s not something we have set out. We have said we believe this is a circumstance which requires emergency legislation and that is what we’re bringing forward.” The UK derogated from article 5 of the ECHR, the right to liberty and security, during the Troubles in Northern Ireland."
23,terror,Police shoot man dead after terror-related stabbing attack in Streatham,"A man has been shot dead by armed police on a busy south London high street following a terrorist-related incident in which a number of people are believed to have been stabbed. 
Witnesses said they saw a man with silver canisters strapped to his chest and holding a ‘machete’ being chased by armed plainclothes officers down Streatham High Road before being shot. 
The attacker was under active surveillance, implying he was considered to post a serious risk, and was well known to the counter-terror authorities, the Guardian understands. He was also the subject of a live investigation. 
One man and two women were injured, according to initial reports, with police confirming that one was in a life-threatening condition. Scotland Yard said a second victim had minor injuries while a third’s condition was described as “not life-threatening”. All three were treated at the scene and then taken to hospital. 
While the investigation is at an early stage it is believed that the suspect was motivated by an Islamist terrorist ideology. 
The Metropolitan police confirmed the man, who was shot at about 2pm, had been pronounced dead and added that the scene had been “fully contained”.

The man shot dead by police was wearing a “fake suicide vest” made of objects designed to look like an improvised explosive device. A similar vest was worn by attackers during the London Bridge attack in 2017 and the later London Bridge attack in November 2019. 
An earlier tweet from the force said: “A man has been shot by armed officers in Streatham. At this stage it is believed a number of people have been stabbed. The circumstances are being assessed; the incident has been declared as terrorist-related”. 
Witnesses on social media said they had heard three gunshots. It is not known how many people were stabbed. Images posted online show a person face down on the ground outside a Boots chemist.

As footage emerged on social media of armed police approaching the prone figure on the pavement, police cordoned off the street and advised people to avoid the area. Some local residents were asked to leave their flats. Eyewitnesses said that the officers were in plain clothes. 
One witness said he had seen the shooting in front of a Boots store on Streatham High Road. “I was crossing the road when I saw a man with a machete and silver canisters on his chest being chased by what I assume was an undercover police officer – as they were in civilian clothing,” he told PA Media. 
“The man was then shot. I think I heard three gunshots but I can’t quite remember. After that I ran into the library to get to safety. From the library I saw a load of ambulances and armed police officers arrive on the scene.”

He said people began running into nearby stores after the incident. “We were all informed to stay in buildings by armed police, until we were evacuated,” he said. 
The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said in a statement: “A man has been shot dead by armed police in Streatham following an incident that is being treated as terrorism-related. A number of people are believed to have been stabbed.” 
“I am in close contact with the Met commissioner and local representatives, and want to thank our police, security and emergency services staff for their swift and courageous response. They truly are the best. 
“Terrorists seek to divide us and to destroy our way of life – here in London we were never let them succeed.”

Boris Johnson, the prime minister, responded to the incident on Twitter, saying: “Thank you to all emergency services responding to the incident in Streatham, which the police have now declared as terrorism-related. My thoughts are with the injured and all those affected.” 
The local Labour MP, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, also responded, saying: “Very concerned to hear about the incident on Streatham High St. My thoughts are with those injured, their families and those who witnessed the attack.” 
Video footage posted by witnesses showed a huge police presence on Streatham High Road, as shoppers were held back by police officers. Paramedics and ambulances attended the scene, and police helicopters circled overhead.

The Met warned people to stay away from the area, tweeting: “Please avoid the area while the emergency services deal with the incident in Streatham”. 
Graham Norton, the strategic commander at the London Ambulance Service, said: “We were called at 1.58pm today to reports of an incident in Streatham High Road. We are working closely with the other emergency services and are treating a number of patients at the scene.

“We worked closely with the other emergency services and sent a number of resources including five ambulance crews, an advanced paramedic practitioner, an incident response officer and a motorcycle responder, with the first of our medics arriving in four minutes. We also dispatched London’s Air Ambulance. 
“We treated three patients for injuries at the scene, and took all three people to hospital.” 
Anna Norman-Walker, the rector of St Leonard’s Church in Streatham, tweeted: “Currently situation in the Streatham rectory with police tape both sides of us … Prayers for our wonderful police who are doing such a remarkable job in a frightening situation”. 
Richard Mustonen-Smith, 59, a response pastor for Ascension Trust, has lived in the area all his life. He told PA Media: “I’m shocked it’s happened in Streatham. I’ve been here all my life. We’re always getting accidents down here but not this.

24,terror,Man charged with terror offence after Heathrow arrest,"A man has been charged with the preparation of terrorist acts following his arrest at Heathrow airport, the Metropolitan police said. Mamun Rashid, from east London, was charged on Sunday after a police investigation had concluded. He arrived back in the UK three days earlier from Turkey after the country said it had deported an Islamic State suspect to the UK. The deportation of Rashid, 26, was part of a controversial push to repatriate the foreign Isis suspects held in Turkish jails. The Met statement said: “A man has been charged with a terrorism offence following an investigation by the Met’s counter terrorism command.” It said he will appear at Westminster magistrates court on Monday."
25,terror,Paddington Green: inside the anti-terror HQ taken over by climate anarchists,"For almost 50 years, Paddington Green police station in London was the nexus of the UK’s anti-terror policing operations. Its 16 high-security, subterranean cells have held IRA terrorists, Islamist would-be suicide bombers and prisoners returned from Guantánamo Bay. But, in an extraordinary reversal, it is now anarchists from groups listed in controversial anti-terrorist guidance who hold the keys to its cell blocks. They have squatted the vast complex and intend to use it as a base for environmental protest. “We’ve got a whole programme of events [planned for the squat]: workshops, skill shares, film screenings, music,” said one of the activists, who asked to be named as Foster. “Other groups are welcome to come and join us” Under the banner of what they call the Green Anti-Capitalist Front, the activists at Paddington Green are planning a week of action at the end of February, including protests in the City. The activists, drawn from groups including Anarchist Federation, the Industrial Workers of the World and Reclaim the Power, all of which were named in a controversial counter-terrorism document, hope to establish themselves as a radical alternative to Extinction Rebellion. The squatters found their way in to what was once described as Europe’s highest-security police station just over a week ago. “A concentrated effort was made to enter the building, using a ladder and gaining access via the roof,” the Metropolitan police said. The squatters did not comment on these claims.     Targets leftover from firearms training that has been carried out inside the former Paddington Green police station Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian    They discovered that the police station – which closed in 2018 – has since been used for urban warfare training by police or special forces. Bullet casings of various kinds were found on the floor and paper targets peppered with bullet holes littered the building. Just one photorealistic target was discovered – a photograph of a man of south Asian appearance holding a pistol. Hardened glass panels in doors in parts of the building have apparently been blasted with shotguns. A pin from a grenade was among the detritus found by the new occupants as they have cleaned up the complex. The Met told the Guardian that the building had been used for “important firearms training”, which has since had to be rescheduled. A spokesperson said the target was “one of many used by police forces nationally, featuring persons of a range of ages, genders and races, where the armed officer has to assess whether the person is a potential threat or not,” but did not explain why no other photo targets were found. The new occupants let journalists from the Guardian in to the fortress-like police station on Friday through an entrance to a large underground carpark. Elsewhere, external doors were barricaded to thwart attempts at eviction. Although much of the building has been gutted, lights and plumbing were working.     An activist from the Green Anticapitalist Front stands in cell in Paddington Green police station’s subterranean custody suite Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian    Paddington Green was built in the 70s, at the height of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, for the detention and interrogation of terrorist suspects. It soon became notorious. The novelist and scriptwriter Ronan Bennett was held there for four days in 1978. “If they took you to Paddington Green you knew you were in serious trouble,” he told the Guardian. “It had an atmosphere of total lockdown, of modern surveillance and incarceration … It had cameras, which in those days were not omnipresent as they are now. “The place had a bleak finality about it, which prompted the feeling, in me at least, that you were never going to get out.” Four decades later, in 2007, one detainee held there for a week described how he was kept in a windowless cell, fed sleeping pills at night, forced to endure freezing showers and only allowed exercise in a small, entirely enclosed courtyard while handcuffed and watched by four guards.     In 2008 the Met responded to criticism from UN human rights monitors by spending £480,000 refurbishing Paddington Green’s cells Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian    Unlike XR, which is explicitly pacifist, the activists of GAF say they “respect a diversity of tactics”, without elaborating much further. Asked what tactics they might employ, one merely said they would “assess the situation and find the right tactic for that situation”. Members spoke of their admiration for the methods employed by protesters in France, who more frequently clash with police and cause damage to property than their comparatively more docile English counterparts – an approach that could yet see them finding themselves inside custody cells that remain under the control of the Metropolitan police."
26,terror,Labor says Australia must take rightwing extremist threat ‘seriously’ and review terror list,"Australia’s Labor opposition has used the anniversary of the Christchurch massacre to call for a review of the criteria used to judge terrorist organisations, citing the fact no rightwing extremist groups are listed in Australia. The shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, has proposed the Morrison government allow the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security to review the criteria to ensure they are fit for purpose. The massacre of 49 people at two mosques in Christchurch in March 2019 prompted calls for greater social cohesion in Australia and a renewed focus on extreme rightwing terrorism, particularly by the Labor party.   Related: One year after Christchurch we seek solace in community and being unapologetically Muslim | Sara Mansour    In October Australia’s spy agency warned extreme rightwing terrorism had become “more cohesive and organised” – a warning repeated in February. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, was soon after criticised for promoting a false equivalence between radical far-right groups and “leftwing terrorism”. The United States and Britain have listed extreme rightwing groups as terrorist organisations. Dutton has said he will do the same if the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation recommends it. Listing an organisation on the terrorism list criminalises membership or association with the group. Keneally has told Nine newspapers that Asio’s warnings about rightwing extremists seemed inconsistent with the fact no rightwing groups were on the terrorist list. “It may be that the criteria for listing organisations in Australia isn’t fit-for-purpose when it comes to rightwing extremism,” Keneally reportedly said. “For example, the definition of terrorism in Australia and the UK is similar but with a stark difference: the UK definition of terrorism explicitly extends to violent acts or threats made for the purpose of advancing a racial cause. “The Australian government and all federal parliamentarians must now take the terrorist threat of rightwing extremism seriously and respond.” Keneally suggested the joint committee could review the criteria for listing terrorist organisations, a bipartisan move that would ensure parliamentarians don’t “play politics or engage in culture wars over such issues”. “Keeping Australians safe is too important for that.” In a statement on Sunday the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Australia “stands in unity and solidarity with New Zealand on the first anniversary of the horrific terrorist attacks in Christchurch”.   Related: Far-right extremists still threaten New Zealand, a year on from the Christchurch attacks    “New Zealanders responded to hate with love in the aftermath of this terrible incident, and that powerful message endures today,” he said. “Our two nations share an ongoing commitment to peace and freedom and we continue to reject those who seek to spread division and hatred. “Globally, whether it’s the Christchurch Call to Action or last year’s G20 and G7 resolutions to stamp out online hate and violence, New Zealand and Australia will continue our work to ensure something like this does not happen again.” In April Australia passed world-first legislation to crack down on violent videos on social media, to prevent a reoccurrence of the Christchurch attacker’s video spreading on social media faster than it could be removed. In February Guardian Australia revealed that one of Dutton’s staff members cited the climate activist group Extinction Rebellion as an example of a troublesome leftwing organisation during a telephone conversation with a member of the public who sought to query his claims leftwing groups also posed a risk."
27,terror,"Islamist extremism remains dominant UK terror threat, say experts","The attack on London Bridge shows the Islamist threat remains strong in the UK, counter-terrorism and counter-extremism experts have said, warning against complacency. The murder of Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones on 29 November by Usman Khan was the first fatal Islamist terror incident in two years. The conversation around extremism and counter-terrorism has been focused on the threat from the far right in the last year following attacks including the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, the El Paso Walmart shooting in the US and the synagogue killings in Halle, Germany. But while UK authorities have warned the far right is the fastest growing threat, Islamist extremism remains the dominant form. On Monday night, a man was arrested in the Bristol suburb of Clifton on suspicion of Islamist-related terrorism offences. The 33-year-old was held on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, Avon and Somerset police said. They added it was not linked to the London Bridge attack. Charlie Winter, senior research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence, at King’s College London, said: “As far as I’m concerned, the threat didn’t go away – if anything, having been defeated in Baghouz [in Syria] earlier this year, the Islamic State’s appetite for terror attacks in the UK is greater now than it’s ever been. “That said, there’s a gulf between appetite and capability, and, besides seemingly isolated incidents like [London Bridge], whether or not the group is able to sustainably and effectively push would-be attackers over the edge remains to be seen.” Milo Comerford, Islamist extremism lead at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), an organisation countering extremism across the ideological spectrum, said: “The London Bridge attack shows we’re not over the hill with Islamist extremism and points to a new phase of the challenge we’re facing. “There is a growing far-right threat and that needs to be seen in context. That, and the defeat of Isis, shouldn’t mean we should take our eye off the ball on Islamist extremism.” Isis has been driven out of Iraq and Syria, where they once exerted control over great swathes of the countries. This has removed a geographical stronghold but the ideology remains. Comerford said: “With the decline of the caliphate in its territorial form, we’re seeing less of the challenges we saw in 2014-15 around foreign fighters and the migration challenge. “Now, we’ve been talking for a long time about the fact we need to be preparing for when they come back, what happens when these people are locked up on terrorism charges, what happens when they come out of prison. This shows we really need to build up this infrastructure and this architecture that doesn’t exist in the form it needs to at the moment.” Khan was jailed in 2012 for his role in an al-Qaida-inspired plot to recruit and train jihadis at a madrassa in Pakistan. Despite taking part in some deradicalisation courses in prison, he launched the London Bridge attack a year after his release. “The prevention architecture is the key bit and the much more cost-efficient part in some ways,” Comerford said. “It’s always going to be a challenge to deprogramme, deradicalise or disengage individuals.” While the far right is clearly on the rise – a global terrorism index recently pointed to a 300% increase over the past five years – Comerford said it was still a tiny fraction of the total worldwide threat. “There is a risk of chasing the latest fad,” Comerford said. “When you take the long view, we’ve been monitoring this for the last 10 years, and looking at how the Islamist challenge has morphed and metastasised. The far-right threat has been hypercharged and the online space has provided a major platform for that, and major challenges for tech companies and police and so on. “There’s a slight sense that the Islamist threat is wrapped up and a done deal. The Labour manifesto ignores Islamist extremism entirely. It talked about ‘far right and others’ when it talked about how it dealt with terrorism. “That suggests it’s all wrapped up and defeating the caliphate on the ground was the end of the challenge … but this ideology is very resilient and morphs and takes new forms and it can be group-based but it can be individual-based like in the case of Usman Khan.” Since 2017, law enforcement agencies in the UK said there have been 25 foiled plots, at least 16 of which were Islamist. In 2017-18, of the 7,318 individuals referred to the authorities, 3,197 or 44% were referred for concerns related to Islamist extremism and 1,312 or 18% were referred for concerns related to rightwing extremism. There were 224 people held in custody for terrorism-related offences in the UK in the year to the end of September, the most up-to-date figures show, and the vast majority, 77% or 173, were described as holding Islamist-extremist views. Raffaello Pantucci, senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), said the absence of fatal attacks in the last two years showed the security services were doing their job, rather than a lessening of the threat. “The absence of reporting around a terrorist group, or discussion around it, doesn’t mean the threat has gone away, it means the security forces are managing it in a more effective way. “The hoopla around the far right is in a way because they didn’t have a grip on that threat. You’ve seen escalating number of arrests, escalating number of plot disruptions, because from their perspective when you disrupt a plot when it comes to a mature level, like building a bomb, that’s a late stage in the game.” Khan was shot dead by firearms officers on London Bridge after fleeing from Fishmongers’ Hall on the north bank of the Thames where he killed Merritt and Jones. An inquest heard they had been stabbed in the chest."
28,terror,Terror police list that included Extinction Rebellion was shared across government,"Controversial guidance that listed Extinction Rebellion as an extremist ideology was sent to a wide range of government departments and local authorities including the Home Office and Counter Terrorism Policing headquarters, the Guardian can reveal. The south-east division of Counter Terrorism Policing was forced to recall the document, which listed the climate crisis group alongside neo-Nazis and jihadists, after it was exposed by the Guardian. After the Guardian revealed the document’s existence Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE) branded it an “error of judgment” and said it “was produced at a local level”. But now, after an internal review, the unit has confirmed the guide was sent to the Home Office, the Department for Education, NHS England, the Ministry of Defence, HM Prison Service, Probation Service and Ofsted, as well as 20 local authorities, five police forces and Counter Terrorism Policing headquarters (CTPHQ) in London.      The guide placed Extinction Rebellion alongside neo-Nazi groups and jihadists and encouraged public sector workers to report any individuals with links to them to Prevent, the controversial anti-radicalisation programme. The distribution list shows a wide range of organisations across the country were in receipt of it for more than a month before it was recalled and prompted questions over the lack of action taken by CTPHQ, the Home Office and others to flag its contents. Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP and chair of the home affairs select committee in the last parliament, said: “The Home Office should explain what action they took when they received the CTPSE guidance and also whether they have yet asked other regional counter-terror units to review and share with the Home Office their counter-terror guidance to make sure they aren’t getting it wrong in the same way. “The Home Office should show some leadership and responsibility on this. It isn’t about an individual investigation, where operational independence is crucial. “Instead it involves the broader shared responsibility between the Home Office, the police and other agencies on how extremism should be defined, what the scope of counter-terror work should be and maintaining public confidence in the crucially important counter-terror work the police do.” The document was also sent to unitary authorities and county councils in Milton Keynes, Slough, Bracknell Forest, Reading, Wokingham, West Berkshire, the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, Southampton, Portsmouth, the Isle Of Wight, Brighton and Hove, Medway, Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Surrey, Hampshire, East Sussex, West Sussex and Kent. Police forces for the Thames Valley, Hampshire, Sussex, Surrey and Kent also received the document. A spokesperson for CTPHQ said: “CTPHQ was included in the wider email distribution list for this document. It was not sent for our review or approval, nor was it forwarded on by the individual that received it to others. As CTPSE has made clear, the document has now been recalled.” The document was made available internally to NHS England staff but was not used for any specific briefings or training sessions. It is understood staff working in counter-extremism in the Department for Education received the guide but it was not forwarded outside the department. Likewise the Home Office did not forward it outside the department. The department did not request the guide, and it was not reviewed, commented on or cleared by the Home Office.       A spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion said: “We need to find out who knew what and when. But more importantly, we need to know why. Why are they trying to silence a peaceful, non-violent movement of people who are trying to make sure the world’s children have a future?” Last week, the security minister, Brandon Lewis, failed to say when the Home Office had seen the document when an urgent question was granted on the Home Office’s oversight of the police in their operation of the Prevent programme. When asked by Cooper when the Home Office saw the guidance, Lewis replied: “As I say, the police have withdrawn the document and are reviewing it. “I fully respect, and the government respect, the independence of the police, and those guidance documents are part of their independence. “The police produce those documents for their officers in the work that they do, and it is right that we respect that. “The home secretary and I meet representatives and the leadership of counter-terrorism police and other partners on a weekly basis. We will raise this issue with them, to ensure that they are focused on the importance of getting this right. “Those documents are about alerting their officers to all the types of groups and symbols that they may deal with in their day-to-day work. We need to acknowledge the regret that the police have shown over this error of judgment, and the fact that they are reviewing the document.” After the document surfaced, the Guardian was approached by teachers and council workers across the country who had received Prevent training that referenced Extinction Rebellion. A separate counter-terrorism document, a guide to symbols and logos, featured Greenpeace, Peta and other non-violent groups alongside National Action, Combat 18 and swastikas. It had been listed by schools, NHS Trusts and safeguarding boards as a Prevent resource material. A number of groups have threatened legal action. City of London police labelled Extinction Rebellion one of its “key threats” in a counter-terrorism assessment and provided awareness training on the climate crisis group across the capital, resulting in “intelligence” tip-offs. Police chiefs have insisted they do not consider Extinction Rebellion and other non-violent groups to be extremists or terrorists and the documents were intended to help officers distinguish between groups of interest and others."
29,terror,Turkey re-arrests Gezi park activist hours after acquittal on terror charges,"Turkish authorities have detained a prominent philanthropist, just hours after a court acquitted him on terrorism-related charges and ordered his release from jail. Osman Kavala was one of nine activists accused of terror charges over their involvement in Istanbul’s Gezi park protests who were acquitted on Tuesday in a surprise ruling. But within hours, a new warrant from the Istanbul prosecutor’s office called for his re-arrest as part of an investigation into a failed 2016 coup against Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government, and under the charge of attempting to overthrow the constitutional order. After his release from the the Silivri maximum security prison on the outskirts of Istanbul, Kavala was taken by police to an Istanbul hospital for health checks before being formally detained again. The court’s earlier ruling was greeted by applause and cries of disbelief in the courtroom where more than a hundred supporters had waited to see Kavala walk free. But an anxious silence overtook the stunned crowd – including Kavala’s wife Ayşe Buğra – when word of the new investigation reached them later on Tuesday. Kavala had been held in pre-trial detention for more than two years, and a guilty verdict had been widely expected for him, the architect Mücella Yapıcı and Yiğit Aksakoğlu, who were also facing life sentences in solitary confinement without parole. After hearing about the new detention order for Kavala, Yapıcı tweeted: “Once again, a freakishness of the law, first you linked him to Gezi in an unrelated and illegal way and now July 15 … Pity this country.” Six more of the 16 civil society figures on trial – among them an architect, a lawyer and filmmakers – were facing 15 to 20 years in prison each over allegations that they sought to violently overthrow then prime minister and now president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The case of seven further defendants, who are abroad and are being tried in absentia, will continue, but arrest warrants against them have been lifted. One lawyer said they were expected to be acquitted if they returned to Turkey. Kavala’s re-arrest sparked immediate condemnation from human rights advocates. “This is a vindictive and lawless move, further demonstrating that Turkey’s justice system is under tight political control,” Emma Sinclair-Webb, of Human Rights Watch, told AFP. Amnesty International slammed the “cynical and outrageous detention” and called for Kavala’s immediate release. “This decision smacks of deliberate and calculated cruelty,” Amnesty’s Turkey campaigner Milena Buyum said. “It is time for Turkey to end the relentless crackdown on dissenting voices.” The high-profile case had already drawn strong criticism from Turkey’s western allies and human rights groups, including the European court of human rights, which in December called for Kavala’s immediate release, saying his extended time in custody served the ulterior purpose of reducing him to silence with a chilling effect on civil society. “This is a trial that should have never happened in the first place. This whole process has caused untold misery to those who were so wrongfully targeted,” said Sinclair-Webb, outside the courthouse. More than 300 observers came to watch the tense proceedings on Tuesday, where the court rejected requests to hear the testimony of defence witnesses and to give the defendants more time to respond to the prosecutor’s sentencing statement. Tensions peaked when security forces tried to remove a defence lawyer from the courtroom. Officers in riot gear arrived after members of the audience and lawyers loudly voiced their objections. Questions had already started to arise over why the court would rule against the government in such a high-profile case . Speculation was rife on Tuesday that the move was calibrated to gain favour in Brussels and other western capitals as Ankara struggles with a new military campaign against Bashar al-Assad in Idlib, Syria’s last opposition-held province. The Gezi trial has been closely watched by western diplomats and human rights groups for years for clues over Turkey’s democratic trajectory. The minister of defence, Hulusi Akar, pointedly acknowledged Nato’s support for the Turkish armed forces in Syria in a statement last week. The 2013 demonstrations were held over the future of Gezi park, a rare green space in central Istanbul, which was slated for redevelopment into a shopping mall. The discontent soon blossomed into nationwide protests against Erdoğan’s increasingly strong grip on Turkey, in which an estimated 3.6 million people took part. The demonstrations were met with a police crackdown in which the Turkish Bar Association says 15 people were killed and about 5,000 more were arrested. The fallout from Gezi reignited political tensions between Turkey’s right and left and set the scene for the increasingly authoritarian direction the government has travelled in since."
30,terror,Minister denies using 'Trump playbook' in terror attack response,"The justice secretary has insisted that the government is not trying to exploit the deaths of two young people in a terrorist attack for election purposes after the father of one of the victims criticised the “ignorance” of the political response. Robert Buckland denied that cuts to prison officer numbers and probation services might have played a role in increasing the risk from terrorism, and said “public protection” had to be at the centre of any response to the deaths on Friday of Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones. But Buckland faced criticism from Phillip Lee, the former Conservative justice minister who defected to the Liberal Democrats in September. Lee said the response had to be based around investment in courts and probation, accusing Johnson of instead using “the Trump playbook”. Buckland reiterated the government’s stance that Labour was ultimately to blame for the release of Usman Khan, who carried out the stabbings, as his early release last year came under sentencing guidelines passed by the last Labour government. Labour called the idea “ludicrous”. Merritt’s father expressed outrage at newspaper coverage of Boris Johnson’s pledge to respond to the attack with a “blitz” against terrorists freed from jail. In a tweet, David Merritt hit out at what he called “vile propaganda”, saying: “Jack stood against everything you stand for – hatred, division, ignorance.”    Don’t use my son’s death, and his and his colleague’s photos - to promote your vile propaganda. Jack stood against everything you stand for - hatred, division, ignorance. https://t.co/R8LO16lugk&mdash; David Merritt (@butwhatifitsall) December 1, 2019    Khan was released under licence seven years into a jail term imposed for taking part in an al-Qaida-inspired bomb plot. At a conference on prisoner rehabilitation he killed Merritt, 25, a course coordinator for Learning Together, a programme run by Cambridge University’s criminology institute, and Jones, 23, who was volunteering at the event. Khan was tackled by members of the public on London Bridge and shot dead by police. Asked if he was “a little ashamed” about the use of the death of two young people for electoral purposes”, Buckland told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I do think we need to pause and get the tone of this debate right.” He added: “But, public protection has to be at the heart of the duty of any government, and I have to put that first and foremost, when considering first of all existing offenders and secondly the future sentencing regime for terrorists. “We’ve got to get it right and there are questions to be asked about why automatic early release was being deployed.” Asked about the government’s crackdown on 70 or so other people convicted of terrorism offences and released on licence, Buckland said these were being checked to ensure they were keeping to licence conditions, and that these were sufficiently strict. Asked whether he should take into account the victims’ views on rehabilitation, Buckland, a former criminal barrister, said terrorism suspects were “a particularly difficult and complex cohort of people”. On rehabilitating criminals generally, he said: “I have met some who have been capable of rehabilitation and who have managed to move away from crime. But I have met others who have not. And the difficulty here is working out who is capable, and who isn’t.” Saying Labour did not appreciate “the importance of public protection when it comes to offences of terrorism”, Buckland denied that cuts to court, prison and probation services had a role in what had happened. But speaking to Sky News, Lee said Johnson was “just pressing buttons” on the subject, saying: ”We know this is the Trump playbook.” Lee said: “The practical reality is it’s extremely difficult to do that if you haven’t got the prison places. And we never really had enough prison places in all the time I was a justice minister. “You can address this by investing in it, investing in the courts, particularly investing in probation, because it’s a cycle – from police, courts, probation. They’ve all got to be working well if you want to reduce crime, reduce pressure on prison, and be able to lock up the people like Usman Khan for much longer, indeed for ever.” Asked about the Conservative response to the attack, Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said politicians should listen to David Merritt: “If we’re going to open this up, I’m not sure this is the right moment.” He condemned Tory attempts to blame Labour for Khan’s release, saying: “So it’s perfectly proper to attack Tony Blair, who hasn’t been prime minister since 2007? It’s absolutely ludicrous. They’ve had 10 years to address this.”"
31,terror,Non-violent groups on UK counter-terror list threaten legal action,"Peaceful protest groups listed in a counter-terrorism guide used as part of anti-extremism briefings are threatening legal action unless it is withdrawn. The Guardian revealed on Friday that Greenpeace, Peta and other non-violent groups were listed alongside neo-Nazis in the document used as part of training for Prevent, the anti-radicalisation scheme designed to catch those at risk of committing terrorist violence. The guide, from June 2019, bears the logo “Counter Terrorism Policing” on every page, and was presented in briefings to public sector workers such as medical staff and teachers. Police said the document was provided to Prevent partners as “a guide to help them identify and understand the range of organisations they might come across”. The groups listed say their rights have been violated and their inclusion in the guidance is “unlawful” and open to legal challenge. The groups behind the legal threat include Animal Aid, Palestine Solidarity Campaign, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and Extinction Rebellion. The letter sent by solicitors acting for the groups says: “Our clients are non-violent organisations focused on lawful protest and engagement to pursue their legitimate aims. “Their inclusion in a Counter Terrorism Policing document, and the inference that they are involved in unlawful activities, and the targeting of their members and/or activists for referral … plainly amount to an unlawful interference with the rights of their members and/or activists.” The groups, via their solicitors Bindmans, say they want the guidance withdrawn and an apology issued. Police so far have stood by their actions. “Our focus is definitely not on lawful protest, or legitimate causes taken up by activists across the country,” Counter Terrorism Policing’s senior national coordinator, deputy assistant commissioner Dean Haydon, said last week. A fortnight ago, police said they were recalling a separate document that listed Extinction Rebellion (XR), the climate emergency activist group, as extremist alongside banned far-right groups and an Islamist group linked to violence. On Wednesday, the security minister told parliament the government does not consider Extinction Rebellion to be an extremist organisation. Brandon Lewis was forced to clarify the government’s stance on XR and a wide range of non-violent protest groups in response to an urgent question tabled in the House of Commons. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, who was granted the urgent question, said the move to list XR was a “very serious error of judgment”, while the Conservative MP and former secretary of state, David Davis, accused the agencies of acting like “thought police”. Lewis said: “Counter-terrorism policing in this country is operationally independent. This is an important principle. The operational independence of our police from government is integral to our democracy. “The Home Office does, however, carry oversight of the police on behalf of the home secretary. We are clear that the right to peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our just society and an indispensable channel of political and social expression. “Counter-terrorism policing South-East have for example stated categorically that they do not classify Extinction Rebellion as an extremist organisation and the inclusion of Extinction Rebellion in their guidance to frontline officers was an error of judgment. The police have recalled the guidance and are reviewing it. “I want to reiterate that Extinction Rebellion is in no way considered an extremist group under the 2015 definition of extremism and the home secretary has been clear on this point.” The government’s counter-extremism strategy, published in 2015, defined extremism as the “vocal or active opposition to our shared values. These include democracy and the rule of law, mutual respect and tolerance of other faiths and beliefs. We also consider calling for the death of our armed forces either in the UK or overseas to be extremism.” Both anti-terror documents revealed by the Guardian encouraged anyone with concerns identified by the content to consider a referral to Prevent or report suspicious activity through the Action Counter Terrorism anonymous online form. Abbott said: “He (Lewis) is telling the house now it was an error of judgment but on this side of the house we would argue it was a very serious error of judgment.” She added: “In a democracy there is a fundamental right to disagreement and non-violent campaigning and interfering or denying that right even in terms of an error of judgment is a fundamental breach of the democratic contract between the government and the governed.” "
32,terror,Guantánamo: psychologist tells of 'abusive drift' in treatment of terror suspects,"A CIA contract psychologist who helped draft the US programme of “enhanced interrogation” of suspected terrorists has told a military tribunal he was unable to stop cases of “abusive drift” by an unnamed senior agency official. Giving evidence at a military commission on Guantánamo Bay, James Mitchell gave a detailed account of the 2002 decision to interrogate suspected al-Qaida leaders using waterboarding and other techniques which the US later admitted constituted torture. On Wednesday, the court was also showed cables from August 2002 between a CIA black site in Thailand and the agency headquarters outside Washington, in which Mitchell and his colleague said they wanted to stop waterboarding an al-Qaida suspect, Abu Zubaydah, because he was being cooperative and it was “highly unlikely” he would produce more intelligence. The CIA staff at the site also said in a 10 August memo that the physical pressure applied on Abu Zubaydah until then “approaches the legal limit” and that his health was “likely to deteriorate to unacceptable levels”. But the next day, CIA headquarters replied, telling the interrogators to “stay the course”. “They said we were pussies, that we had lost our spine,” Mitchell said, who claimed he threatened to quit. But Abu Zubaydah was subjected to further waterboarding the same month, at a demonstration for CIA officials, despite the prisoner having “involuntary stomach and leg spasms” and he was “distressed to the level that he was unable to effectively communicate or engage with the team”, according to an August 2002 memo. At this week’s 40th pre-trial hearing of the 9/11 case in a specially built courtroom at the US naval base, Mitchell was watched with close attention by the five defendants. On the front row closest to the witness box was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-proclaimed mastermind of the 2001 commercial plane attacks on New York and Washington, who was waterboarded 183 times. In testimony which veered from the gruff to jokey to tearful, Mitchell said the methods he had recommended were based on a course given to US armed services to help them withstand enemy interrogation, known as Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (Sere).   Related: Guantánamo: psychologists who designed CIA torture program to testify    The measures, which included slamming detainees repeatedly against a wooden wall, cramming them in a small box sometimes with insects, and waterboarding, simulated drowning, had been approved by the justice department in July 2002 under the George W Bush administration. Mitchell claimed those measures were within the limits of what was legal, and were designed to force detainees to give up information rapidly that could help prevent a further attack, possibly involving a nuclear weapon. “The CIA was never interested in prosecution,” he told the court. “They were going to go right up to the line of what was legal, put their toes on it, and lean forward.” However, within the official limits, Mitchell and up to two others subjected Abu Zubaydah to waterboarding 83 times and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed 183 times. Mitchell, his friend and future business partner, Bruce Jessen, and a veteran CIA officer known as the Preacher, were permitted to carry out waterboarding. As a private contractor working abroad, Mitchell was paid $1,800 a day. He told the court that when he was recruited by the CIA in 2002 to first observe and then apply coercive measures, said the agency was determined to “get tough” and he wanted to make sure it was done within limits.     James Mitchell gave a detailed account of the 2002 decision to interrogate suspected al-Qaida leaders using waterboarding and other techniques which the US later admitted constituted torture Photograph: Supplied    “What I was told was: ‘The gloves were off’,” Mitchell, now aged 68, a tall, thin man with a trimmed white beard, dressed in a charcoal suit and red tie. “They were going to use some form of physical coercion … My concern was that they were going to make it up on the fly.” Mitchell has accused other CIA interrogators of using waterboarding far in excess of guidelines as well as other unauthorised interrogation techniques. In court on Tuesday he described these excesses as “abusive drift”.   Related: Inside the CIA’s black site torture room    “When people are left to make up coercive measures, it tends to escalate over time,” Mitchell said.  He said he had tried to stop several interrogations that had got out of hand, in particular by the head of interrogations of the CIA’s newly formed rendition, detention and interrogation group, an unnamed officer he referred to by the nickname, the “new sheriff”. The head of interrogations has elsewhere been identified as Charlie Wise, who died of a heart attack soon after retiring in 2003. Before he left the CIA, Wise had a similarly dim view of what was going on, describing the interrogation programme as a train wreck “waiting to happen”. “I intend to get the hell off the train before it happens,” Wise said in a declassified CIA memo. In his evidence on Tuesday and Wednesday, the Tennessee-born Mitchell gave his version of events in a strong southern accent, pointing out he had voluntarily flown to Guantánamo Bay to give evidence. “I didn’t do it for you,” he told James Connell, the defence lawyer questioning him on Tuesday. “I did it for the victims and families” of the 9/11 attacks. On entering the plain square courtroom lined with military police guards, Mitchell appeared to make eye contact with Mohammed who he had subjected to multiple waterboarding sessions and with whom he claimed to have had long discussions about Islam. Mohammed came to court in his customary outfit of a camouflage jacket over a white robe and a woollen Afghan cap. His dyed orange beard provided the brightest colour in the courtroom. His fellow defendants, Walid bin Attash, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Ammar al-Baluchi and Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi, sat in successive rows behind him, each with their own bench of lawyers. The pre-trial hearing have been underway since May 2012 and the trial itself is not expected to start until 2021 at the earliest. Mitchell described how he was called to the CIA’s counter-terrorism centre in early April 2002 to attend a meeting where it was announced that a leading al-Qaida suspect, Abu Zubaydah, had been captured in Pakistan. Mitchell, who had previously worked as a psychologist for the US air force was told to get on a flight the same night to a secret CIA “black site” in what was called “location 3”, now widely believed to be Thailand. He was initially asked to observe Abu Zubaydah’s interrogation by CIA officers and FBI agents and make suggestions. But when he returned to CIA headquarters at the beginning of July, he was asked to carry out the “enhanced” interrogations himself. He said he was highly reluctant but there was a prevalent fear of an imminent second wave of attacks, possibly including a nuclear weapon. Choking his words and tearing up as he defended his actions, he told the court: “I felt my moral obligation to protect American lives outweighed the temporary discomfort of terrorists who had taken up arms against America.”"
33,terror,The Hanau terror attack shows the need for honesty about racism in Germany,"I have to admit that when I heard the news my first thought was: “I hope the perpetrator wasn’t a migrant.” The press would surely go at us hammer and tongs again, warning about the danger posed by immigration in general and Muslims in particular. There would be endless articles and talk shows discussing the threat. My second thought was: “Thank God it is a white guy.” On 19 February, Tobias Rathjen went into two shisha bars in the town of Hanau, near Frankfurt, shooting people he described as “foreign”. In his “manifesto”, if you can call such a rambling text a manifesto, he stated he wanted to cleanse Germany from … us. Two weeks on from the carnage in Hanau, I wonder how I could have felt relieved.   Related: This is Europe: stay close with the Guardian’s email updates    The general public in Germany seemed surprised. Shocked, I would have understood, but surprised? Hanau was the latest in a series of far-right terror attacks in Germany. Yet in our collective minds terror is brown. And I don’t mean that politically. So unused are we to seeing media images of victims who aren’t white that we have no language for them. The TV news (Die Tagesschau) called the crime “fremdenfeindlich”, which translates as “hostility towards foreigners”. But the people who were murdered in Hanau weren’t foreigners. Most of them were second- or third-generation Germans. How long do we have to live in Germany before we stop being foreigners? What got me most was the video of a young survivor talking from his hospital bed. When the gunman started shooting, he had fallen on top of another young man, and his friends threw themselves on top of him. They were a ball of human beings and the one lying underneath said: “Brother, I can’t feel my tongue. I can’t breathe.” He had been shot in the throat. He sounded so much like my teenage son when he talks to his friend: “Brother, I kiss your eyes.” But when I emailed a friend whose children were the same age and asked her how she felt after Hanau, she replied: “Hanau?” Of course she had been outraged by the crime. It just wasn’t foremost in her mind.    In the 2000s, the equation went: Turkish people have been killed so the killers must be Turkish gang members    It’s the same with rightwing propaganda. The journalist Yassin Musharbash explains: “When certain politicians say certain things, most Germans see their statements as indecent, but the migrant part of the population sees them as threats.” Just a few days before the Hanau shootings the far-right political party AfD had published a colouring book for children. One of the pictures showed a convoy of cars bearing Turkish flags, the drivers brandishing weapons. Likewise, the Hanau killer had ranted in his manifesto about “crimes committed by non-white immigrants”. So crimes by white immigrants seemed fine. Another picture invited children to happily colour in black men with bones in their curly hair groping white women in a swimming pool. (To be honest, most books in my childhood had racist images like that, but I thought we’d progressed.) Yet another picture showed women in burqas with loads of children in front of a clocktower showing five minutes to 12, which is the German metaphor for “act now before it’s too late”. And yes, that was the other dominant strand in the Hanau manifesto: “inferior” races outbreeding Germans or tainting their blood by interbreeding. (Incidentally, a journalist tried to find out just how many women wore burqas in Germany and found two ... worn by white women in an S&amp;M studio. There are practically no burqas worn in German streets. Still, the AfD ran its 2017 election campaign with “bikinis instead of burqas” on its posters.) The common reflex is to think that everything is worse now than it used to be. That’s neither true nor fair. A lot has changed. Angela Merkel will attend a memorial service for the Hanau victims. The then chancellor, Helmut Kohl, didn’t think it was important to show his respects when neo-Nazis set fire to a house in Solingen in 1993 and killed five people of Turkish descent. He had “more important appointments” and didn’t go in for “condolence tourism”. It could just be that Merkel is a nicer human being than Kohl, and she probably is. But it is also a new era. When the neo-Nazi terrorist group National Socialist Underground (NSU) killed at least nine people of Turkish descent in the 2000s, the equation went: Turkish people have been killed so the killers must be Turkish, too, and they must all be gang members. The police preferred to listen to a clairvoyant than to suggestions the crimes could be racially motivated. The media called the murders the “doner killings”, turning the victims from human beings into fast food. The NSU files will be kept from public view for 30 years.   Related: Hanau attack reveals 'poison' of racism in Germany, says Merkel    This time Angela Merkel made it clear Hanau was a racist crime. Just her using the word “racist” was a quantum leap. And I trust her when she says she will do everything to prevent this from happening again. But I don’t trust Friedrich Merz, who wants to be her successor as CDU leader. Six days after Hanau he proposed to fight rightwing terror by targeting foreign “clan criminality” and implementing stricter border controls. When a colleague from Der Spiegel asked if he’d really said that, Merz replied: “The answer is yes.” “Clan criminality” is also the pet hate of North Rhine-Westphalia’s CDU interior minister, Herbert Reul. He has ordered more than 1,000 raids on shisha bars in his state in the last 18 months alone. Even though there is no clear definition of what “clan criminality” is supposed to be, and clan liability has been outlawed in Germany since 1945. No wonder the Hanau killer had the impression that shisha bars were hotbeds of crime. A study conducted by Macromedia University Hamburg showed that while migrants commit far fewer crimes than white Germans – after all there are fewer of them – in TV reports on crime they outnumber white Germans by eight times and in newspapers 14 times. Worse, if the media talks about migrants, in 34.7% of all cases it is only as criminals. Make no mistake, the terrorist and he alone is responsible for his actions. But we – and by this I mean our politicians and media – are all guilty of creating a climate of fear and mistrust. But that also means we can change it. What we need most at the moment is civic trust. Oh, and the release of those NSU files. • Mithu Sanyal is an author, academic and broadcaster based in Dusseldorf"
34,terror,Counter-terror police running secret Prevent database,"Counter-terror police across the UK have been running a secret database containing details of thousands of individuals referred to the government’s controversial anti-radicalisation Prevent programme, the Guardian can reveal. The National Police Prevent Case Management (PCM) database is managed centrally by national counter-terrorism policing headquarters. It is accessible to all police forces across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and the Home Office are able to request data from it, according to documents sent to the human rights group Liberty and seen by the Guardian. The stated aim of Prevent, a voluntary programme, is to divert people from terrorism before they offend and crucially deals with individuals who have yet to cross the criminality threshold.   Related: 'My son was terrified': how Prevent alienates UK Muslims    Each Prevent referral received is added to the PCM database by individual police forces, including personal details and reasons for the referral, but the person is not notified, responses to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests submitted by Liberty showed. Other agencies are able to request information held on the database. The revelations about the existence of the database come at a time when Prevent is facing renewed scrutiny as an independent review begins, sparked by years of accusations that the programme had become a toxic brand that disproportionately targeted Muslims. Police chiefs said recording referrals ensured accountability and allowed forces to understand when vulnerabilities are increasing. Gracie Bradley, Liberty policy and campaigns manager, said: “This secret database isn’t about keeping us safe. It’s about keeping tabs on and controlling people – particularly minority communities and political activists. “It is utterly chilling that potentially thousands of people, including children, are on a secret government database because of what they’re perceived to think or believe.” Any rank of police officer or staff can access the database but users must be Prevent practitioners, who are vetted and given training prior to access. Chief constables are the designated data controllers within their respective forces.   Prevent referrals graphic   The exact number of individuals on the database is currently unknown but forces that responded to Liberty’s request for information said all referrals were added at the time of receipt and official statistics show that 21,042 individuals have been referred in the three years to March 2018 alone. In the most recent year available, 2017/18, a total of 7,318 individuals were subject to a referral but 3,096 or 42% left the process requiring no further action and 3,466 left the process and were signposted to alternative services. The majority – 4,144 or 57% – were aged 20 years or under. Within this figure, 2,009 were under 15 and 2,135 were aged 15 to 20.   Prevent referral graphic 2   Ultimately, only 394 were escalated to the Channel process, which provides specialist support to people who were deemed at risk of being drawn into terrorism following a number of assessments. Police Prevent practitioners also have access to the Channel Management Information System which is a database of Prevent Channel cases, the responses said. CMIS is owned and managed by the Home Office. Information on the database is derived from referrals made by public servants like teachers and doctors as well as police, who are compelled to monitor and report signs of what they believe could indicate extremism under a controversial statutory duty. In its response, the Met police said an individual can challenge the decision and have their details removed but the challenge may not always be successful depending on the circumstances. However, the force did not elaborate on how that would be possible given that individuals are not aware their details are entered on the database. Harun Khan, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: “That a database is being compiled by police forces detailing every Prevent referral is deeply worrying. That it is secret is even more concerning. “This database – over and above being a hugely authoritarian tool – will mean that the vast majority of those referred, who are found to have no terrorism link, will still be perceived as potential risks by the state, and this will disproportionately affect Muslims. “Our questions on transparency, accountability and oversight around Prevent now become even more important.” The independent review of Prevent, announced in January, attracted controversy itself when it emerged the man appointed to lead the exercise, Lord Carlile, had admitted to parliament that he “may be somewhat biased towards” the programme and had pledged his “considered and strong support” to it, prompting calls for him to step down. Further criticism was triggered by the terms of reference for the review, published last month, which suggested the exercise would not “consider past decisions” made under the programme. Lord Carlile sought to reassure critics by claiming that “everything is up for discussion, including scrapping” the programme. One of four strands of the government’s counter-terrorism strategy known as Contest, Prevent was created by the Labour government in 2003 and its remit was widened by the coalition government in 2011. The statutory duty on schools, NHS trusts, prisons and local authorities to report concerns about people who may be at risk of turning to extremism or terrorism was introduced in 2015. A National Police Chiefs’ Council spokesman said: “The public would expect the police to maintain professional records of those individuals referred for support as potential victims of radicalisation. This is no different to the way we record other forms of supportive safeguarding activity such as child sexual exploitation, domestic abuse or human trafficking. “Good records ensure we are accountable, allow us to understand when vulnerabilities are increasing, and ensure we act consistently and proportionately, only taking action in those cases where our support is necessary. “If we did not maintain proper, legally compliant records, the public would rightly have far less confidence in the police.”"
35,terror,The Guardian view on emergency terror laws: nothing to do with Europe,"British lawyers played a leading part in drafting the European convention on human rights. Britain was the first nation to ratify it in 1951. Winston Churchill, a trailblazing advocate from the start, was prime minister when it came into force in 1953. In 1998 the convention was written into UK domestic law as the Human Rights Act. More than 70 years after Churchill first called for “a charter of human rights, guarded by freedom and sustained by law”, and in spite of wobbles, Britain remains a signed-up bulwark of a European human rights order that is entirely independent of the EU. Nevertheless, as the Eurosceptic virus has colonised the Conservative party, the party’s commitment to the European convention which it helped to create – and to the European court of human rights which enforces it – has come under increasing strain. Successive recent Tory leaders have had the convention and court in their sights. Each talked of replacing the European convention with a British charter of rights. Confusion between the Strasbourg-based human rights court and the entirely separate Luxembourg-based European court remains embarrassingly rife. Hostility towards the very concept of human rights is increasingly entwined with populist hostility to European institutions. In the wake of Brexit, it is naive to think that Britain’s place in the European human rights order is not at serious political risk too. The government’s messages on new terrorism laws illustrate this concern. On Tuesday, a spokesman refused to rule out the possibility that the new counter-terrorism bill – which will make sentencing changes for terrorists – may derogate from the convention. This was written up in the anti-European papers as Boris Johnson suspending European human rights laws to keep terrorists locked up. In fact, it is doubtful if the proposals to change the date of automatic prisoner release (which have not yet been published in detail) would necessarily breach the convention. But this did not deter the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who on Wednesday said the right to walk the streets freely trumps the rights of prisoners. Yet that is not in dispute, and it is not changed by the planned new powers. The politics of the new legislation are now framed in an interchangeably anti-European and anti-human-rights context. This is a serious concern. Drip-drip disparagements of human rights and the European convention echo the alarming tone of the 2019 Tory manifesto. This talked of “updating” the Human Rights Act to provide “a proper balance”, not just with national security but with “effective government”. It is right to be suspicious about such words. Weakening an established human rights code that Britain can be proud of is not on. Pushing the bill through parliament amid anti-European distractions is even worse. The counter-terrorism bill does not need to breach human rights, including European rights. Ministers should stop toying with the public and the rule of law by pretending that it does."
36,terror,Destroyer: Have We Met review – synth-pop adventures in small-hours terror,"It’s not intended as snark or faint praise when I describe Destroyer as very much an acquired taste. It’s more a statement of fact. Singer-songwriter Dan Bejar, who more or less is Destroyer, has a hefty cult following, who have accompanied him through the series of baffling stylistic shifts that have constituted Destroyer’s career to date: come for the abstruse lo-fi racket of We’ll Build Them a Golden Bridge, stay for the 13-minute disco workout on Bay of Pigs, or the ambient collaboration with Tim Hecker, Archer on the Beach. They’ve even invented a Destroyer drinking game: take a shot whenever Bejar hits on one of the overarching lyrical themes they insist give coherence and uniformity to his oeuvre. Drink if there’s a reference to fire or other disaster; drink twice for mention of an apocalypse.     Destroyer: Have We Met album art work Photograph: Publicity Image    The wider world, however, plods on regardless. If the stylistic lurches don’t put people off, there’s always Bejar’s voice – a mannered, etiolated, oddly Anglophone sprechgesang – or his lyrics, which, overarching themes notwithstanding, tend to the mystifying. On Destroyer’s 13th album, Have We Met, you can take your pick from “calling all cars, the palace has a moss problem”, “I was like the laziest river, a vulture predisposed to eating off floors, no, wait, I was more like an ocean” or “the music makes a musical sound, measured in echoes by my famous novelist brothers Shithead 1 and Shithead 2” among its plethora of WTF? moments. It’s hard to escape the feeling that Bejar prefers to be cult. Whenever something close to mainstream acceptance has come calling, he has pulled back dramatically. Kaputt, his 2011 homage to mid-80s British pop, over which New Order and Prefab Sprout’s shadows loomed large, was shortlisted for the Polaris prize, Canada’s equivalent of the Mercury, while its follow-up Poison Season made the lower reaches of the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. In 2017, the darker, denser Ken put paid to that. On paper, this follow-up sounds more off-beam still – a series of offcuts from earlier work, stream-of-consciousness lyrics, taped in Bejar’s kitchen: “no re-recording, no cleaning up”. The listener thus primed for 40 minutes of hard work may be surprised. As on Kaputt, Have We Met’s main musical touchstone is Britain’s post-postpunk new pop moment, the brief window in the 80s when the desire to make music that was commercial melded with the desire to make music that was inventive and intelligent. As if to signpost where it’s coming from, the album contains a song called Cue Synthesizer. Have We Met is rich with sonic signifiers of that era: sombre washes of synth, slap bass, booming drums, commanding, reverb-laden woah-Vienna piano, guitars that squall or cry mournfully – the entire title track is consumed by a desolate solo – but never rock. Moreover, the set is rich with melodies: only the ambient ramble of The Television Music Supervisor obviously sounds like a product of the album’s working method.           Destroyer: Cue Synthesizer – video    Bejar has talked about being drawn to this brand of 80s music simply because it’s what he remembers hearing on the radio as a kid, but it fits here for reasons beyond nostalgia. However glossy the sound of new pop, it was frequently underscored by anxiety and fear, sometimes explicitly linked to the era’s nuclear paranoia, sometimes not: even the business of getting ready to go out could be transformed into a troubling psychodrama on The Associates’ exquisite Party Fears Two, a song that seems to echo through the plangent keyboard lines that stand in for choruses on Have We Met’s Crimson Tide and It Just Doesn’t Happen. There’s a similar sense of alarm beneath the album’s shiny surface. In contrast to the image given by the cover – Bejar shot as louche crooner, mic in hand, shirt open to mid-chest – his words rush out in panicky bursts, struggling to cram in all the syllables. Bejar’s stream of consciousness keeps returning to disquieting places. “Just look at the world around you,” opens The Raven. “Actually, no, don’t look.” By the time we reach University Hill, paranoia reigns. Forces unknown are coming “to hack us up”; we’re “staring at oblivion”; “the game is rigged in every direction”. Devotees of the Destroyer drinking game are likely to be paralytic by its close. But, weirdly, it works: for all the inexplicable non-sequiturs, it accurately captures a sense of ineffable small-hours dread, and of nameless fear poking through random thoughts.   Related: Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras    On the closing Foolssong, the album’s peculiar, compelling balance between the familiar and the confusing, the straightforwardly appealing and the shudder-inducing, finally seems to topple. Perhaps the melodically sweetest song here, it eventually collapses into creepy ambient noise, as if overwhelmed by the fear. But for all the bleakness of its conclusion, the songs on Have We Met stay with you, testament to the fact that Bejar only really makes two kinds of album – the kind you admire for its bloody-mindedness and the kind you actively enjoy. Have We Met belongs to the latter category. Even at their poppiest, Destroyer remain an acquired taste. This time around, it’s one more than worth acquiring.

38,terror,Man in terror trial 'bragged of deceiving jury into clearing him',"A man accused of plotting terror attacks at tourist hotspots bragged to undercover officers that he had previously deceived a jury into clearing him over a sword attack on police outside Buckingham Palace, a court has heard. Mohiussunnath Chowdhury, 28, from Luton, Bedfordshire, is on trial at Woolwich crown court for allegedly planning to kill members of the public at busy London locations including Madame Tussauds, the Gay Pride parade and on an open-top tour bus. He was acquitted of a terror charge by an Old Bailey jury after attacking police officers with a sword outside the Queen’s London residence in 2017. But prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC told Woolwich crown court that after Chowdhury was cleared, he became driven by “dreams of martyrdom”. From January 2019, three undercover officers worked to earn Chowdhury’s trust and to tap into his extremist views and he unwittingly confided his plans to them, the court heard. Atkinson said: “Believing them to be as sincerely committed as he was, he told them of his devotion to the cause of violent Islamic extremism, the basis for this devotion and the skewed religious beliefs that underpinned it …” “Various potential targets were discussed between the defendant and those he believed to be committed to the same cause and the same forms of violence as himself. “The object was to unleash death and suffering on non-Muslim members of the public who happened to be present, using a firearm, sword and even a van as part of an attack.” In the 2017 incident, two unarmed officers suffered cuts to their hands when they fought to disarm Chowdhury near the Queen’s London residence as he shouted repeatedly “Allahu Akbar” (God is the greatest). He had claimed the incident outside Buckingham Palace had been an attempt at suicide and it was not an attack. But after being cleared in December 2018, he posted an Instagram message describing the police officer who had confronted and disarmed him outside Buckingham Palace as a “cuck”. Atkinson told jurors Chowdhury’s assertions to the undercover officers amounted to an admission that he was “indeed trying to carry out a terrorist attack in 2017 and that he had deceived the earlier jury that acquitted him of it”. The prosecutor added: “Whatever the position in 2017, he was unquestionably preparing for terrorism in 2019.” He said the defendant was able to buy a replica Glock gun and told the undercover officers of his plans. “He told them of his training regime, and sought to involve them in his firearms-related training,” said Atkinson. “He told them of what he was wanting and planning to do, and sought to involve them in the carrying out of one or more terrorist attacks.” The lawyer said Chowdhury, inspired by hate preachers such as the deceased Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, began preparations “to undertake that which he had been stopped from doing in 2017 – an act of terrorism”. On 10 March 2019, the defendant used his sister Sneha Chowdhury’s bank account to buy two Red Oak Bokken wooden training swords, which were delivered to their home address, the court heard. His sister, who is also on trial, did nothing to stop her brother’s plans, Atkinson told the court. Mohiussunnath Chowdhury is charged with one count of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts, collecting information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism and of disseminating terrorist publications. His sister, of the same address, denies two charges of failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism. The trial continues. "
39,terror,Terror on all sides: inside a firestorm tearing through the Australian bush,"The fear in the eyes of Claire and Laurence Cowie’s horses is unsettling. 
On all sides of their paddock, flames are dancing in the distance. 
The mountains looming above Tallabrook Lodge, about an hour’s drive south on the highway from Canberra, are glowing an angry red. 
Behind a small hill to the south, a patch of native tea trees has exploded, sending flames and thick black smoke high above the ridgeline and igniting a grassfire that races northwards at breakneck speed. 
 
  Related: Thomas Keneally: ‘These fires have changed us’  
 
The panicked horses are pacing circles along the paddock’s edge. They’re nervous. Everyone in this region is. 
Fires around Australia’s capital have been raging for days, enveloping the city in smoke and threatening towns and suburbs on its outer edges. 
But Laurence Cowie is calm. He’s been watching the fire since it broached the hilltops at 6.30am. The house is prepared. There’s little fuel around and a clear break between the home and the old, dried-out gums and pines that line parts of the property. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
“I’ve got the beer on ice,” Laurence jokes to the Guardian. “Power’s always the first thing to go. Warm beer: it’s deadly.” 
Each time a spot fire threatens the fringes of his property, Laurence floors his ute to the scene, dousing the flames before they can take hold. 
As the vehicle zips to and fro across Tallabrook Lodge, the sky overhead is darkening. The wind begins to whip through the valley, gusting with all-consuming force.

The Cowies are at the edge of the property, protecting their stables, when the chaos arrives. From nowhere a wind picks up and sends fire barrelling towards the back of their home. Laurence is too far away to do anything. 
Screams for help are muffled by the wind. Each new yell draws thick smoke into the lungs. 
Inside, the wind rattles the windows. Flames are licking at the back wall. Each glass pane becomes a portal to the hell outside. 
Everywhere is chaos. The horses break free and run wildly from the flames. 
New fires are breaking out on all sides. Laurence and Claire are shouting orders above the wind’s roar to the media who have stayed at their property.

Journalists are on hoses. Photographers are driving cars to already burned-out earth to save them. 
All the while, ash and dirt is whipped up into the air and thrown at eye level. 
“We’re fucked,” one photographer says amid the chaos. “This is real hairy.”

The terror lasts until the fire has nowhere left to burn. Its fury only abates when it has no more grass to feed on. 
It finally burns itself out and an eerie calm descends on the valley. 
All that’s left is blackened earth. The hills to the west are burnt and smouldering. Thick smoke still lingers. 
The paddocks on every side are scorched right up to the house. Dried-out gum trees are slowly consumed by remnants of fire. Old tree trunks are burning.

Not far from the home, flames slowly eat away at the stable, until it’s little more than a heap of crumpled iron. 
With it goes the 120 hay bales Laurence was using to feed his mares and two dozen head of cattle. 
“I’ve been stockpiling to save starving animals,” he says. “Now I’ve got starving animals and no feed.” 
The house is encircled by evidence of disaster but, miraculously, it has survived. 
“Well, what can you do, we’re alive,” Claire says. “We’ve got a house. Not a lot of fencing left.”

  Everything around Laurence and Claire Cowie's property is blackened. The wind is still fierce but it's now eerily quiet. The only things burning are old tree trunks and large logs. We can see the mountains to the west, just. Laurence is having a beer. #bushfires @_LisaMCox pic.twitter.com/v1ux3S5NuN— Christopher Knaus (@knausc)

An hour later we’re sitting on the porch, looking out to the mountains in the west and watching the ruined stable smoulder. 
The Rural Fire Service radio blares away in the background. Each voice tells of another looming emergency, somewhere else between Bredbo and Michelago. 
But here, at least, it’s over. 
“Well, I’ll probably sleep well tonight,” Laurence says, ice-cold beer in hand."
40,terror,"Justice system playing 'Russian roulette' with public, says terror expert","A counter-terrorism specialist has described the criminal justice system as playing “Russian roulette” with the public, after it was revealed the London Bridge attacker had been released from jail following his conviction for terror offences. Chris Phillips, a former head of the UK national counter-terrorism security office (Nactso), said: “The criminal justice system needs to look at itself.”“We’re letting people out of prison, we’re convicting people for very, very serious offences and then they are releasing them back into society when they are still radicalised.“So how on earth can we ever ask our police services and our security services to keep us safe?“I’ve said it a few times today, we’re playing Russian roulette with people’s lives, letting convicted, known, radicalised Jihadi criminals walk about our streets.” It comes after the security minister, Brandon Lewis, refused to say whether the attack showed a “failure” by authorities, and repeatedly refused to comment on the specifics of the incident, but said more assessment was needed of the sentences given to violent criminals. On Friday, a man and a woman were killed by an Islamist extremist who had been released on licence from jail where he had served time for an al-Qaida-inspired bomb plot. The Metropolitan police are investigating how Usman Khan, 28, was able to commit the attack near London Bridge, despite being known to the authorities and fitted with an electronic tag to monitor his movements.   Related: Tell us: have you been affected by the London Bridge attack?    Khan was sentenced in 2012 for his part in a plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange. He was sentenced to a minimum jail term of 18 years but appealed and got a 16-year jail term, half of which would be spent in prison. This allowed for him to be released a year ago. He was out on licence and subject to restrictions at the time of the attack. Sources say he complied with those restrictions and did not show signs of planning anything. He attended Fishmongers’ Hall on Friday for a University of Cambridge-organised conference on rehabilitating offenders. The government wants to move swiftly in its review of sentencing for violent crimes after the London bridge attack, the security minister, Brandon Lewis, has said. Lewis said it was right to ask whether tough enough sentences were being given to people committing such crimes. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think it is right that we do have to look again at the sentences, as I say, around these violent crimes. The prime minister has argued that, has made that point previously, and made it very clearly last night.“We will want to move very swiftly because our first priority is the safety of people around the country.”  The Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, spoke earlier on the programme about the impact of police cuts on safety. “You can’t disaggregate terrorism and security from cuts made to resources of the police, of probation, the tools that judges have … The key thing is we need to support the police and security service.“The point I am making is we can be safer, with more police and more resources.” Lewis responded to Khan’s comments by saying: “Police funding for counter-terrorism policing has consistently increased since 2015. As have counter-terrorism police numbers.“The Metropolitan police is the best-funded per capita police force in the country and we will continue to ensure they have the resources they need to keep us safe.” Khan said armed police patrols in London would be increased over the coming days to reassure the public.“What I am conscious of is both Londoners and visitors may be feeling slightly nervous this weekend and so what the [police services] will be doing over the course of this weekend and the next few days is have more high-visibility police officers present in London.“That includes armed officers as well, and the key thing is not for the public to be alarmed by the fact that there are more armed officers, uniformed officers, present – there will also be plain-clothed officers present – but to reassure Londoners and visitors that we are as safe as we can be.” The threat level in London is “substantial”, which means threat is likely. It was lowered from “severe” earlier this month. The two people who died have not yet been named. A man and two women were also injured. The casualties were taken to the Royal London hospital in Whitechapel, one of the capital’s four designated major trauma centres. NHS England said on Friday night that one of the three injured was critical but stable, a second was stable and a third had suffered less serious injuries."
41,terror,UK extremism tsar urges rethink after Extinction Rebellion listed as terror threat,"The government’s chief adviser on extremism has called for a clearer official definition of extremism in the light of revelations that Extinction Rebellion and other non-violent groups have featured in counter-terrorism materials. Against a backdrop of increasing political pressure to investigate the error, Sara Khan, who leads the commission for countering extremism (CCE), said police chiefs were right to recall guidance that batched XR alongside violent neo-Nazis and jihadists. Her intervention came as the interim leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, wrote to the home secretary, Priti Patel, demanding an update on the independent review of the controversial anti-radicalisation programme Prevent and calling for the latest revelations about XR to fall under its remit. The future of the review has been left in doubt after its chair was forced to step down last month. Earlier this month, the Guardian revealed Extinction Rebellion featured on a list of extremist ideologies that should be reported to authorities running Prevent. Police chiefs said including XR was an “error of judgeent”, recalled the guidance and launched an internal review. Since then, teachers, council officers and other public sector workers have come forward to share their own experiences of Prevent training in which XR and other non-violent groups featured. Sara Khan, the lead commissioner for countering extremism, said: “It is right that CTPSE (Counter Terrorism Policing South East) have recalled their guidance on Extinction Rebellion. Our police, security and statutory bodies have a duty to assess complex risks every day to protect the young and vulnerable from extremism which can present itself from a diverse range of ideologies as our work has shown. “I believe it is in our country’s interest that we have a clearer description and consensus of extremism which can be used by the police, government and public bodies to help them carry out their roles. “A clearer description will also help build a whole society response by providing a better understanding.” Police chiefs have emphasised that Extinction Rebellion is not considered to be an extremist or a terror organisation, and they do not seek to stifle the legitimate right to protest. But recurring examples of Prevent training sessions featuring XR and others have been met with anger from the targeted groups and there is now increased political pressure for the independent review of Prevent to investigate what happened. The review, which was written into legislation that passed into law last year, was left rudderless when less than 12 months after the review was announced its chair, Lord Carlile, was forced to step down after a legal challenge was brought against his appointment over the question of his impartiality. In a letter to the home secretary, Davey and his Liberal Democrat colleague, Christine Jardine, the spokesperson for home affairs, call for clarity over the review and demand that the inclusion of XR and other nonviolent groups in some Prevent training materials falls within its remit. Davey and Jardine say: “We would be grateful if you could update us on the progress of the independent review of Prevent, especially in light of the Guardian’s revelation that Extinction Rebellion was listed by Counter Terrorism Policing South East as an ‘extreme ideology’ that should be reported under the programme. “This case highlights exactly some of the concerns that the Liberal Democrats and others have about Prevent. Teachers, childcare providers, NHS workers and others have effectively been told by police that they are under a statutory duty to report people for protesting about the climate emergency. “That is very alarming for its implications for freedom of expression and the right to protest, as well as for undermining crucial trust between children and their teachers, patients and their doctors, individuals and the police.” The letter asks when the home secretary expects to appoint a suitable reviewer and begin the review and to ensure its terms of reference include the effect of Prevent on human rights, including freedom of expression, adding: “The recent revelation about Extinction Rebellion make clear how important that aspect is.” The Home Office has been approached for comment."
42,terror,"Doctor Who recap: series 38, episode four – Nikola Tesla’s Night of Terror","‘You’re going to change the world, but first you’re going to save it’ Holy Elon Musk! For this year’s first ‘celebrity historical’, Chris Chibnall’s Doctor Who continues its noble tradition of celebrating underappreciated figures from history. But shining a light on the pioneering inventor Nikola Tesla, who gave us AC electricity though never achieved due acclaim in his lifetime … well it’s hardly The Shakespeare Code is it? For those of us largely unbothered by details of electrical current, Night of Terror is a classic story of realising your true potential. This reimagining sees Tesla (in a charismatic performance from ER’s Goran Višnjić) targeted for his expertise by unpleasant scorpion race the Skithra.     A lucrative rival ... Robert Glenister as Thomas Edison. Photograph: Ben Blackall/BBC    It’s not a great predicament, with the destruction of the Earth a possibility. But his rival, the far more lucrative Thomas Edison, is nevertheless peeved that they didn’t choose him to aid their plot. Edison (Robert Glenister) is portrayed broadly as a twerp – I don’t know enough about the specifics to be sure if this is accurate, but he does make for a compelling not-quite-baddie. The upshot is an enjoyable enough knockabout, which reaches a frustratingly by-the-numbers resolution after a compelling setup. After the epic scale of Spyfall and last week’s horrorfest Orphan 55, this does rather feel a touch straightforward. But, at the very least, it’s an intriguing history lesson. And lest we forget, that’s one of the things Doctor Who is there for. Life aboard the Tardis The team are getting their fair share of jollies lately, what with last week’s doomed trip to Tranquility and this week’s doomed jaunt on the Orient Express (has the Doctor forgotten what happened last time she boarded that train?) Meanwhile, it’s refreshing to see Yaz given something palpable to do, with her police training proving crucial in resolving this particular pickle. Fear factor Things were never going to match the high watermark of last week’s Dregs – the scariest beings we’d witnessed in several years. But high-speed giant scorpion monsters the Skithra were still a winningly realised menace … even if there was something slightly off about their queen’s cockney twang. Mysteries and questions Jodie Whittaker made some interesting comments last week about this year’s supposed big story arc. But she suggested that the foreshadowed mystery of the Timeless Child may not be resolved this series. Speaking on a panel in New York, she said: “I think the beauty of Chris [Chibnall’s] writing is that nothing is an accident … I think you don’t necessarily always rush to get the answer. So it’s not to say you won’t discover something. You’re not going to be denied.” Not quite curiouser and curiouser then, but certainly an indication that Whittaker and Chibnall are planning on sticking around.

43,terror,Jonestown: Terror in the Jungle review – the death cult survivors speak out,"‘There was nothing special about us,” says Tim Carter. “There was nothing unspecial about us.” Carter is a survivor of the 1978 Jonestown massacre. He appears with a handful of others in Shan Nicholson’s two-part Storyville documentary Jonestown: Terror in the Jungle (BBC4). It was first shown in the US two years ago, on the 40th anniversary of the deaths of more than 900 people in the Peoples Temple in Guyana, headed by the Rev Jim Jones, who ingested potassium cyanide in an act of what he called “revolutionary suicide”. Until 9/11, it was the largest single loss of American life by deliberate act. Whether you call it mass suicide, suicide-murder or simply mass murder probably depends on how much you already know. Outside the US, many of us only know of it through the phrase “drinking the Kool-Aid” (the cyanide was delivered in soft drinks, actually Flavor Aid) as a synonym for being brainwashed or believing in something bizarre. It conjures a common conception of those who died as a homogenous group of gullible fools. Carter, who lost his wife and son in the compound’s pavilion, objects deeply to the way the massacre has been simplified and reduced. Nicholson’s film should bring some comfort: its grave and careful tracing of how Jones and his followers came to be where they were and do what they did restores much of what has been lost in cultural translation. Although we open with some of the extraordinary, horrific footage from the moment of discovery in the Jonestown compound, the film’s focus quickly shifts to and largely stays on the history of the Peoples Temple, its followers’ motivations and their leader’s gradual transformation from charismatic preacher to crazed despot. Jones founded what would become known as the Peoples Temple in 1955, when he was just 25. It was the first desegregated church in Indiana. His pro-integrationist and civil rights stance surely helped attract black followers and white idealists to his cause in greater numbers than perhaps anything else, though the film doesn’t make much of this point, nor interrogate too closely how genuine or calculated a position it was by Jones. His later claims to socialism are treated with more scepticism. Perhaps this is overthinking things, but the lack of examination of his racial progressivism feels strange in such an otherwise detailed portrait of events. You wonder if it’s because Good Man Gone Bad makes for a better narrative than On the Make From the Beginning and Just Got Worse. But perhaps Jones and his origins are slightly glossed over simply because there is so much to be heard from the survivors – including two of Jones’s sons, Jim and Stephan – who, 40 years on, are only just at peace with their experiences. Their testimonies are spare, direct and all the more harrowing for that. Carter was seeking solace after the horrors of Vietnam, others were fleeing unhappy childhoods and other traumas. Some simply believed in Jones’s promise of a better world. They talk about how intensely persuasive he was, and their accounts are interspersed with the plentiful audio footage that exists from all stages of the evolution of the Temple and its leader. It leaves you free to ponder how what sounded like sanctuary to many sounds only like aggression and a kind of terrifying certainty now. Is that the benefit of hindsight alone? Or proof that you hear what you need to hear? These up-close-and-personal descriptions of life under a power-hungry, drug-addicted narcissistic leader exerting increasingly brutal physical and mental control over his followers are given context by Jeff Guinn, on whose book, The Road to Jonestown, the film is based. Nothing is sensationalised, but the details quietly and relentlessly build into an ever more dreadful threat. By the day of the massacre, which began with the murder of Senator Leo Ryan who had flown out to investigate Jonestown after former members went public with their concerns that people were effectively being held against their will, it feels like an organic, inevitable ending. Not the demise of fools, but of frightened people, coerced and controlled for years, surrounded by armed guards instructed to shoot them if they fled, drinking Flavor Aid or forcibly injected with it if they refused. It was a film about ordinary people’s capacity for faith, for hope, for denial and for exploitation by those with an extraordinary capacity for harm. Would that we were in a position to take no lesson from it at all."
44,terror,Man who tackled London attacker with tusk says Trump is 'feeding terror',"The man who used a narwhal tusk to tackle the London Bridge terrorist Usman Khan has accused Donald Trump of “feeding terror” with his belligerent Middle East policy, warning it will breed more murderous attackers like the one he and others faced. In his first interview since Khan killed two people and injured several more at a criminal justice conference on 29 November, Darryn Frost said the US president’s decision to assassinate General Qassem Suleimani would cost lives and added: “The next generation of terrorists will rise as a direct result of these actions and we must condemn them now.” Speaking in detail about his ordeal for the first time, Frost, 38, a civil servant working for HM Prisons and Probation, revealed how he tackled Khan alongside two convicted men, using an ornamental tusk to stab Khan through the abdomen, and pinned him to the ground, despite believing that he was wearing an explosive device. He described how in the weeks following the atrocity he had been racked with survivor’s guilt.     Khan being tackled on London Bridge during the attack in November. Photograph: web    Frost has launched a campaign, Extinguish Hate, to convene support for kindness as an antidote to extremism. The former prisons minister and London mayoral candidate Rory Stewart has backed it. Frost said he did not dispute the right of the United States to consider Suleimani a bad actor, but the decision to kill him outside a state of war was wrong and would cause a backlash. His warning came as the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, said this week that her force was “extremely alert” to potential repercussions within the UK from the Iran crisis, while an Iranian foreign ministry spokesman said Iran could consider the UK “a partner in this crime”. Khan was jailed in 2012 for al-Qaida-inspired terrorism offences and released in 2018. He was a delegate at the conference at Fishmongers’ Hall celebrating five years of a programme bringing students and prisoners together to study criminal justice. At about 2pm he launched his attack, killing Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones, both Cambridge graduates. “Their deaths have created a drive within me to challenge hatred and intolerance,” he said. “What feeds terror is actions like this where people in power act as judge, jury and executioner across borders and jurisdictions. Who is Trump that he can have this sort of impact across all our lives? Khan may have come from this country so people may not understand why he was extreme. The people who influenced him are likely to be the people who have lost loved ones because of our actions abroad.” Frost described how he was at the conference in the ornate livery company building on behalf of the Ministry of Justice when he heard shouts downstairs. “Someone said it could be teenagers, but an ex-prisoner next to me said it wasn’t,” Frost said. “That was my call to action.” As he ran down the stairs he saw someone below lying motionless in pooling blood. Khan had already landed fatal blows on Merritt and Jones. Fearing there would be nothing downstairs that might be improvised as a weapon he turned back and found a pair of ornamental narwhal tusks on the first floor, and slid one carefully from its wall bracket so as not to break its sharp tip.     Usman Khan, the London Bridge terrorist attacker, who had arrived early at the conference at Fishmongers’ Hall. Photograph: Darryn Frost    He returned to see Khan wielding two large knives above his head and confronting Steve Gallant, a convicted murderer and fellow delegate. “He was slashing at Steve, but Steve had a chair. I pointed the tusk at Khan’s belly and the balance of power shifted in our favour. Khan turned and said to me: ‘I am not here for you. I am here for the police. I am waiting for the police.’”  Frost said Khan then added: “I’ve got a bomb.” As Frost considered the risk to the delegates upstairs of an explosion, Gallant threw a chair at Khan which only clipped his shoulder. Khan was back in charge so Frost passed the unarmed Gallant his tusk and ran back upstairs to collect the other one, passing people tending to Jones. “People don’t see the bravery of those individuals who put themselves in harm’s way,” he said. There was another person lying beyond Khan in a pool of blood whom no one could reach. Upstairs again, a Ministry of Justice colleague urged Frost to stay away, but he said: “I’m not having any of this,” and pushed the colleague to the wall. He scrambled downstairs with the second tusk to see the first tusk shattered. Gallant, again unarmed, was pursuing Khan, knives raised, out into the street where he seemed to be “going for the public, going for maximum damage”. Also outside was John Crilly, another convicted killer and delegate who was blasting a fire extinguisher at Khan. “Steve and John were shouting out to the public, ‘Get away, he’s killed people,’” and people fled “like a shoal of fish swimming from a shark”. “He came at me and, instinctively, I stabbed him in the lower abdomen. I felt it go in and he didn’t react, but when I pulled it out he slumped for a half second … Steve, totally unarmed, grabbed Khan by his left shoulder and pulled him off balance.” Khan landed face down on his knees. As the others piled on, Frost lay on Khan’s back, grabbed his wrists, and implored the others to “take the knives”. Even though he was lying on top of a terrorist who had told him he had a bomb, he never feared he would die, he said. He was worried when the police arrived that that would be Khan’s trigger.   Related: Prisoner reveals role in tackling London Bridge attacker with narwhal tusk    Fleetingly, he was able to see the device strapped to Khan. “I thought it was amateur or a hoax. I could see cardboard and little pieces of duct tape. It looked hollow.” But he also saw a mobile phone tucked into it, making him worry he could have an accomplice who could detonate the device remotely, if it was real. The police finally yanked Frost off Khan and fired shots into the attacker’s chest and abdomen, killing him instantly. “I thought it was fireworks, his pathetic attempt at an explosive device. I hung my head thinking, ‘It’s amateur, it’s fake.’ I was really upset at this loss of life. People will see me as a terrorist sympathiser and I am not. I sympathise with the loss of life and where it could have been prevented.” However, Frost is sure the police had no reason to believe the bomb was not real. He had not told anyone of his suspicion it was amateur or fake. They went back into the hall and Frost looked down from the window and saw Khan dead, lying on his back on the bridge pavement, the fake bomb visible around his midriff and one of his knives a few yards from him. He picked up a section of the shattered tusk, which he carried with him to the triage centre. Life since has been difficult. “The first two weeks were horrendous. It was like a movie going through my brain at 100mph. I’ve had lots of memory loss. I am feeling really depressed and low. I have been suffering from survivor’s guilt. Why should I have any joy when Jack and Saskia can’t any more? “But I am proud of the actions I, John, Steve, Lukas [a Polish kitchen porter who was injured] and others took. That has helped me.” "
45,terror,"Blood, terror and bass: the heavy return of dub poetry","Earlier this year, British poet Roger Robinson met one of his idols, Linton Kwesi Johnson. With his 1978 album Dread Beat an’ Blood, which fiercely criticised police brutality in London and forecast the 1981 Brixton riots, Johnson helped to establish dub poetry: a blend of chest-rattling bass and thunderous verses speaking truth to power. He gave Robinson a memorable, if cryptic, missive. “He said, ‘Nobody needs to sound like me now,’” recalls Robinson, who records and performs with Kevin Martin (AKA deep bass explorer the Bug) as King Midas Sound. “That made me think, what would dub poetry be now? He’s a very progressive thinker and he would want to see it morph into something that has the same sentiment, but a different framework and emphasis.” He may have found the answer. King Midas Sound’s stark, resonant new album Solitude arrived last spring, along with a wave of underground artists such as Amet, Asda and the duo of Jay Glass Dubs and Leslie Winer, who are revitalising dub poetry for a new era of political tumult and social injustice. Like their predecessors, who emerged from reggae’s soundsystem culture, this next generation of dub poets is by no means aesthetically similar. Even the term itself, coined by Jamaican dub poet Oku Onuora, has been controversial, with luminaries such as Johnson and Mutabaruka identifying as simply “poets” to distance themselves from it – but their ideologies are unquestionably shared. “It’s about equality and justice,” explains Lillian Allen, Toronto dub poet and professor. “Calling the system to account and validating people’s inner voices and experiences, and giving voice to all kinds of things that are unknown, unseen and unspoken, and recalibrating the knowledge to provide a new perspective.” Last year, the Last Poets – the godfathers of hip-hop – excoriated the US administration on their album Understand What Black Is. Founding member Abiodun Oyewole set their lyrics to reggae because it’s “rebellious music that speaks volumes, and doesn’t abide with the systems that exist, governmental systems and so forth”. Indeed, when Oyewole booms “America is a terrorist!” on Rain of Terror, his transmission comes through loud and clear, whether framed by spectral skanking or, on the dub version, syrupy reverb.     Camae Ayewa, AKA Moor Mother. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian    Another dub poetry champion is Camae Ayewa, AKA Moor Mother, a poet, musician and activist who runs youth workshops in her north Philadelphia community. “I’m a reactionary artist, in the sense that I’m stuck in what’s happening now,” she says. “That’s the beautiful part of dub poetry: saying your perspective and everyone’s perspective in the moment.” In 2016, Moor Mother released the formidable Fetish Bones, a eulogy for black people killed by police officers and a condemnation of the festering politics that gave the US President Trump. On its follow-up, Analog Fluids of Sonic Black Holes, Moor Mother performs her signature “DIY time travel” to explore black histories, from slave narratives to the Rodney King beating, with hypnotic intonations, granular samples and churning digital noise. She also recently collaborated with the London Contemporary Orchestra on The Great Bailout, a free-verse poem that interrogates slavery, colonialism and commerce, and which helped the UK develop into a stronghold of dub poetry and other music of the Caribbean diaspora. Though her art is rooted in punk and hip-hop and draws from myriad sources – free jazz, Black Arts poet Sonia Sanchez, Rage Against the Machine – it fits under dub poetry’s increasingly expansive sonic parameters. Ayewa speaks of her art and activism in the same breath but eschews “protest music,” a label that Robinson and Martin embrace on Solitude, where Robinson’s hollow declarations of lost love bottom out in a post-apocalyptic soundscape of formless low-end and high-pitched whines. Through the bleakness of Martin’s production and Robinson’s character, the personal becomes political, and ties Solitude to dub poetry’s commentary on society. “Dub poetry is a form of protest art,” says Martin. “It felt like there was an air of desolation in the record that’s appropriate for where we are now in history, and in the world, which seems more turbulent than ever. There’s this precipice of chaos leading to God knows where.”           Listen to Zonal, featuring Moor Mother.     Ayewa has also teamed up with Martin and Justin K Broadrick as Zonal. Though Broadrick’s background as singer with the industrial metal titans Godflesh and his solo mutant shoegaze project Jesu might make him an odd choice for a dub poetry collaboration, he can bring Ayewa’s philosophical dispatches to unsuspecting audiences who could benefit from it the most. “I’ve met many people over the years who said that Godflesh not only opened the doors for them musically, but socially and politically as well,” he says. “I hope that people are listening.”   Related: Moor Mother: 'We have yet to truly understand what enslavement means'    On Zonal’s standout track In a Cage, Moor Mother echoes the nihilism and futility that underpins Solitude as she riffs on the Smashing Pumpkins: “Despite all my rage/ We still in a daze.” Dub poetry’s brilliance is to bring that dazed world into a little more focus."
46,terror,Fast response to terror attacks saves lives. UK medics should not be held back,"The Streatham terrorist attack has again highlighted one of the most difficult decisions the emergency services face – deciding when it is safe to treat wounded people. In the aftermath of the stabbings by Sudesh Amman, a passer-by who helped a man lying on the pavement bleeding claimed ambulance crews took 30 minutes to arrive. The London Ambulance Service (LAS) said the first medics arrived in four minutes, but waited at the assigned rendezvous point until the Metropolitan police confirmed it was safe to move in. Like the perpetrators of the London Bridge attacks in both 2017 and 2019, Amman was wearing a hoax suicide vest. There is a long, brutal history, from Baghdad to the Warrenpoint ambush in 1979 , of using secondary attacks to slay those who rush to terror scenes. The inevitable chaos of a bomb or an attack by several people, such as the 2017 attacks in London Bridge and Borough market, means it can take a long time to be sure all the perpetrators are accounted for.   Related: London Bridge attack: response reminded me of my pride in our extraordinary NHS | Vinod Diwakar    But last summer, the London Bridge inquest heard it took three hours for paramedics to reach some of the wounded. Prompt treatment might have saved the life of French chef Sebastian Belanger, who received CPR from members of the public and police officers for half an hour. A LAS debriefing revealed paramedics’ frustration at not being deployed sooner. In the wake of the two-hour delay in fire crews arriving at the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017, the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, called for the inflexible rules around the deployment of emergency services at terrorist incidents to be loosened so staff on the scene could take pragmatic decisions. In the run-up to the London Olympics, the then prime minister, David Cameron, sharply criticised the preparations for an attack for being too risk-averse. A group of UK and international experts in delivering medical care during terrorist attacks highlighted alternative approaches in the British Medical Journal last week. In Paris in 2015, the integration of doctors with specialist police teams enabled about 100 wounded people in the Bataclan concert hall to be triaged and evacuated 30 minutes before the terrorists were killed. The experts writing in the BMJ believe the UK approach would have delayed any medical care reaching these victims for three hours. These are perilously hard judgment calls. Policymakers and commanders on the scene have to balance the likelihood that long delays in intervening will lead to more victims dying from their injuries against the increased risk to the lives of medical staff who are potentially putting themselves in the line of fire by entering the so-called “hot zone”. The stilted prose of the inquests and inquiries that follow each attack can never capture the pandemonium, panic and fear in the midst of which decisions have to be taken, while the false clarity of hindsight can give the unfair impression that first responders – particularly the people in charge – lacked courage or behaved irrationally. But the Bataclan example is instructive. Virtually everyone who was evacuated survived. UK procedures risk leaving members of the public and the police battling to keep people alive while paramedics waiting just metres away are prevented from doing their job.   Related: Sign up for Society Weekly: our newsletter for public service professionals    Of course these protocols are reviewed in the wake of each new atrocity, and improvements have been made over the years. But there is growing evidence that more substantial changes need to be considered. First responders themselves need to be at the forefront of this debate. As the people who have the experience, face the risks and want more than anyone to save as many lives as possible, their leadership and insights are vital. In the wake of the Streatham attack the government is looking at everything from sentencing policy to deradicalisation. Deciding how best to save the wounded needs equal priority in the response to terrorism. • Richard Vize is a public policy commentator and analyst"
47,terror,Jihad Jane review – the women seduced by terrorism,"‘She seemed like a normal country girl.” That’s Kurt speaking, ex-boyfriend of Jihad Jane, a blond, blue-eyed woman from suburban Philadelphia, real name Colleen LaRose, convicted in 2014 of conspiracy to murder a Swedish artist who drew a cartoon of the prophet Muhammad. What emerges in this fascinating documentary, made with sensitivity by Irish film-maker Ciarán Cassidy, is that LaRose was anything but normal, after a childhood scarred by horrific abuse. Cassidy also profiles Jamie Paul Ramirez, dubbed “Jihad Jamie”, another vulnerable woman convicted on terrorism charges in connection with the same plot. The two women became radicalised in much the same way, watching YouTube clips of Israeli air raids on Gaza with a growing sense of anger and outrage. Both joined online jihadi chatrooms where they met an Algerian man, Ali Damache, who lived in Ireland where he claimed to be the leader of a jihadist group. Separately, they flew out to join him, Ramirez bringing her six-year-old son with her. She arrived on a Sunday and married Damache the next day. On the phone from prison, LaRose, who wears a full veil, describes the childhood abuse she experienced at the hands of her father, who first raped her at the age of seven or eight. She ran away at 13, and was pimped on the streets, marrying a client at 15. Ramirez had been married and divorced three times before she converted, the first time at 18 to a man in his 30s who was violent. “People laughed at me my whole life. I’ve always had low self-esteem,” she says. Cassidy interviews the women’s families as well as the Swedish artist, Lars Vilks, who gives every impression of being a raging narcissist. The film left me with ambivalent feelings towards the two women. It’s impossible not to feel compassion for them; they are so damaged and vulnerable. But, while both have renounced terrorism, you sense that their identities are still bound up with their jihadi adventure; it gave them purpose and self-worth. Perhaps the tragedy here is how terrorism in the home so frequently goes unpunished. Unbelievably, LaRose is now a Trump supporter: “I do not like what he did with the Israelis and Palestinians, but I would vote for him.” • Jihad Jane is released in the UK on 14 February.           "
48,terror,The Beauty and the Terror by Catherine Fletcher review – the dark side of the Italian Renaissance,"The historian Catherine Fletcher has a well-deserved reputation as a specialist in 16th-century skulduggery and intrigue. In Our Man in Rome (2012) her subject was Gregorio Casali, a wily Italian fixer who served as Henry VIII’s ambassador at the papal court during the crisis of the king’s divorce from Catherine of Aragon. In The Black Prince of Florence (2017) she recounted the brief and lurid career of Alessandro de’ Medici, the illegitimate son of a Medici duke and a Moorish maidservant, who jockeyed to power as the first hereditary ruler of Florence, married a daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor, and was murdered in the course of an adulterous liaison at the age of 26. These are lively, well-researched books built round an interestingly dodgy central character. Her latest offering, The Beauty and the Terror, has a much larger canvas, covering a whole sweep of 16th-century Italian political and cultural history. She begins in the 1490s – an exciting but deeply turbulent decade: the “discovery” of the Americas by Christopher Columbus and Amerigo Vespucci, the French invasion of Lombardy, Girolamo Savonarola’s “bonfire of the vanities” in Florence, Leonardo da Vinci’s painting of The Last Supper in Milan, the election of the libertine Borgia pope, Alexander VI.   Related: Nonfiction to look out for in 2020    The decades that followed were ones of almost continuous warfare. External military threats – French, Spanish, Ottoman – were counterpointed by endless internal squabbles among the principalities and city-states of the peninsula. Fletcher tracks through a complex and dismal story of alliances, betrayals, sacks, sieges, famines, assassinations and gruesomely ingenious tortures. The conquest of the Romagna by the pope’s warlord son, Cesare Borgia, was swift and vicious. It was closely observed by a Florentine diplomat, Niccolò Machiavelli, who made it a case study in his book The Prince, written about 1512 and published posthumously 20 years later. This laconic breviary of amoral realpolitik – memorably described by Bertrand Russell as a “handbook for gangsters” – is the keynote text of these wartorn years. The impact of the Lutheran Reformation and the retrenchment of the Counter-Reformation add further dimensions of religious ideology to the conflicts.     Machiavelli’s inspiration … Portrait of Cesare Borgia by Altobello Melone (c1513). Photograph: Dea/Adgli Orti/De Agostini/Getty Images    Fletcher navigates this difficult terrain with great skill. She creates atmosphere and drama without any surrendering of clarity. Those with only a vague knowledge of the League of Cambrai or the Council of Trent will find them crisply explained and contextualised. She also has some trenchant chapters on the sexual politics of the era – as evidenced in the enforced seclusion of women in convents, and the glorification of rape in the pornographic poetry of Pietro Aretino and his followers. This is a powerful book, but it is also one with an argument or agenda to pursue, and in this aspect it is less satisfactory. The argument is signalled by Fletcher’s ambitious subtitle, which promises us an alternative history of the Italian Renaissance. The orthodoxy she challenges is the view of the Renaissance as an unbroken vista of exquisite art and aspirational inventiveness: a new dawn that flooded the superstitious murk of medievalism with the bright light of reason. As she points out, this somewhat utopian view was essentially a 19th-century invention, formulated in works such as Jacob Burckhardt’s The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy (1860) and endorsed by eloquent Victorian aesthetes such as Walter Pater. For the majority of those who actually lived and worked in this supposed golden age, the reality was grim: they knew it as a time of terror more than beauty. In his Art of War (1521) Machiavelli argued that the cultivation of courtly art was a weakness. Looking back to the first French invasion of 1494, he criticised the complacency – the “splendour and deceit” – of the Italian princes. “They were preparing themselves to be the prey of whoever assaulted them,” he wrote, and from this arose “great terrors, sudden flights and miraculous losses”. Burckhardt’s idealistic view of the Renaissance has long since been challenged – the Marxist historian Arnold Hauser dismissed it is an anachronistic attempt to “provide a genealogy” for 19th-century liberalism – but in Fletcher’s view it remains entrenched as a convenient cliche, and a whole lorryload of guidebooks to Italy could be cited to confirm she is right.   Related: Renaissance painting found in kitchen in France sells for €24m    So the argument of her “alternative history” is that this celebratory rhetoric “masks the brutal realities” of war, corruption, oppression and misogyny that are the facts of life in Renaissance Italy. So far, so good. But is it also true, as she asserts, that the great artistic achievements of the period are in themselves complicit in these brutalities and injustices? Her key example, heavily flagged up in the publisher’s promotion, concerns that most iconic of Renaissance artworks, The Mona Lisa. Here is the pitch: the woman portrayed in the painting, Lisa Gherardini, “was married to a slave trader”. This “backstory”, she believes, puts a new and very negative perspective “on the Mona Lisa’s famous smile”. Given the apparent gravity of this charge against Lisa’s husband, the silk merchant, Francesco del Giocondo, it is as well to state the facts behind it. Fletcher’s source is a recent discovery published in Martin Kemp and Giuseppe Pallanti’s Mona Lisa: the People and the Painting (2017). It shows that the archives of Florence cathedral record 11 baptisms sponsored by Francesco between 1487 and 1500. It is indeed likely that these people – 10 females and one 12-year-old boy – were slaves, being brought to the baptistry to be converted to Christianity: three of the women are described as “Moors” and another has an African-sounding name, Cumba. It is certainly significant that well-to-do households in Renaissance Italy had trafficked Africans among their servants; and it’s regrettable that Leonardo did not vet the moral purity of his clients more carefully. But to call Francesco a “slave trader” on the basis of 11 baptisms in 13 years seems more like a soundbite than a genuine argument. In a similar vein she discusses the possibility that the Venetian courtesan Angela del Moro, AKA “La Zaffetta”, was the model for the languidly reclining nude in Titian’s Venus of Urbino of c1534. She had earlier been the victim of a gang-rape, an episode lubriciously described in a poem by Lorenzo Venier, “Il Trentuno della Zaffetta” (1531). Thus, the argument might run: Titian’s Venus is implicated in the endemic sexual violence of the era, though as the identification of La Zaffetta as the model is highly speculative, this is once again a kind of special pleading. These notes of 21st-century disapproval – however justified – run counter to the clarity of historical vision that is otherwise a feature of this fine book. • The Beauty and the Terror: An Alternative History of the Italian Renaissance by Catherine Fletcher is published by The Bodley Head (RRP £25).

49,terror,Anti-terror police take over Paris knife attack case,"French counter-terrorism police have taken over the inquiry into an attack by a state employee who killed four colleagues with a kitchen knife inside Paris’s police headquarters on Thursday. The assailant, named in the media as Mickaël H, 45, was a computer scientist in the intelligence branch at police headquarters, and had worked for the police for 15 years. He had full security clearance in an office that coordinated counter-terrorist intelligence gathering in the capital. The case was handed to counter-terrorism police after analysis of the assailant’s phone and messages between him and his wife was carried out. Police sources told Agence-France Presse that preliminary inquiries suggested he could have become radicalised. The attacker worked in a section of the police service dedicated to collecting information on jihadist radicalisation and had security clearance, raising issues about the force’s own system of internal security checks. Counter-terrorist investigators were working to find out what led him to launch a knife attack on police officers he worked with, whether it was premeditated and whether he entered the building with his own knife. At lunchtime on Thursday, deep inside the vast police complex near Notre Dame in the centre of Paris, the man took a ceramic knife and launched a killing spree that lasted only a few minutes. First, in an office in his own department, he killed three police intelligence officers. Then he took a stairway, killing another staff member and injuring two more before heading towards the exit. A young intern police officer, who had worked in the building for only a few days, called for the man to drop the knife. When he did not, the young officer shot him in the head, killing him. There were no surviving witnesses from the room where he first attacked and killed three officers, so it is not clear what he may have said to them before the attack. Initially the killings had been treated as homicides and investigated by regular police. As searches and checks continued at the assailant’s home, the counter-terrorism force was called in and police officials said no motive was being ruled out. Police on Friday continued to search the attacker’s home in a small town near Charles de Gaulle airport north of the city. Data from his computers and phones was also being assessed. Within hours of the attack, investigators in balaclavas were seen removing computer equipment from the property. The assailant, who was French and born on the island of Martinique, had converted to Islam 18 months ago, but initial searches at his home were reported to have shown no sign of any radicalisation. He had not been on any watchlist. The government spokeswoman, Sibeth Ndiaye, said on Friday morning that the possibility of a terror motive had not been ruled out. But she said: “It is important to emphasise you are not a terrorist because you are Muslim and converting to Islam is not an automatic sign of radicalisation.” She told France Info radio: “The facts need to be looked at carefully.” The interior minister, Christophe Castaner, said the assailant had “never shown any behavioural problems” and never aroused the “slightest reason for alarm”. The attacker was said to be a quiet and unassuming member of staff, and no change in his behaviour had been noted in the weeks before the attack. Paris’s police chief, Didier Lallement, said on Friday that the force would be “forever marked by this drama. We will not forget.” The attacker’s widow told investigators that her husband, who had a severe hearing disability, displayed “unusual and agitated behaviour” the night before his crime, a source close to the investigation told AFP. She was questioned all day on Friday. The attack came a day after thousands of officers marched in Paris to protest against low wages, long hours and an increasing suicide rate in their ranks."
50,terror,Police referred own staff to counter-terrorism scheme,"Two police forces referred members of their own staff to a government programme designed to steer vulnerable individuals away from committing acts of terrorism, inspectors have revealed. The revelation comes after a 21-year-old frontline Metropolitan police officer was arrested on suspicion of being a member of a banned rightwing terror group. “Insider” threats posed by staff vulnerable to radicalisation are overlooked by the majority of forces, according to a report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS).   Related: MoD put pressure on regulators to delay drone safety warnings, documents reveal    The report also called into question the omission of the Ministry of Defence police (MDP) from the list of public sector bodies subject to the Prevent statutory duty, which legally compels workers to refer concerns about extremism to the programme. The MDP is a civilian force that provides armed and unarmed security at sites around the country such as the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston, housing estates for military personnel and training areas. Overall, the inspectorate found that forces were meeting their Prevent duty with “many positive aspects of the Prevent work police forces do”. Few police officers interviewed by inspectors recognised that colleagues may be vulnerable to radicalisation because of the influence of a partner or close family member, the report said. “Only one force had arrangements in place acknowledging that members of staff vulnerable to radicalisation might need safeguarding,” it said. “The remainder would rely on existing counter-corruption or misconduct policies and monitoring by supervisors. Only two forces gave examples of having used a recognised Prevent referral approach to deal with a staff member who was vulnerable to extremism. The vulnerability of staff generally was not referred to in forces’ Prevent training, the report said. “But it is a real threat. Few staff we interviewed had considered the possibility that their colleagues could be vulnerable to radicalisation.” The constable arrested on 5 March on suspicion of membership of a proscribed organisation reportedly has alleged links to National Action, a neo-Nazi group. The constable was released on police bail until a date in late March pending further inquiries. Last year, the Guardian revealed that a suspected far-right sympathiser was feared to be at large in the Met, after managing to scrawl, undetected, a swastika in a secure area of a police station. The culprit has not been caught and the discovery shocked minority ethnic staff and other employees. The swastika was found in February 2019, drawn on an inside wall at Edmonton police station in Enfield, north London, in an area only accessible to officers and staff. Inspectors said the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence should review the MDP’s omission from schedule 6 to the Counter-terrorism and Security Act 2015. Schedule 6 lists public sector organisations and individuals subject to the Prevent statutory duty. “Ministry of Defence police interviewees couldn’t understand why their force hadn’t been listed in schedule 6,” the report said. “At the time of the inspection, Ministry of Defence police were drafting a Prevent policy and standard operating procedure, as they believe they should feature in this legislation. ‘“Because of this, and similarities between this force and the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (and, to a lesser extent, British Transport Police), we believe the Prevent duty should apply.” The report comes with the independent review of Prevent, a commitment to which was written into legislation, mired in crisis. The review’s former chair, Lord Carlile, was forced to step down in December over allegations regarding his lack of impartiality and the government is yet to appoint a replacement. The total number of referrals to Prevent in the year to March 2019 was 5,738, the most recent available statistics show. However, only 10% went on to receive specialist support through what is known as the “Channel” process. The National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for Prevent, Chief Constable Simon Cole, said: “Prevent is the only strategy that will succeed in reducing the terrorism threat in the long-term – and we must do more to champion its work and improve trust in our communities. “As this report highlights, the police service can and will make improvements to the way we carry out our Prevent duties, and as the NPCC lead I will ensure every single one of the recommendations made by the HMICFRS will be met.”"
51,terror,Revealed: anti-terror center helped police track environmental activists,"A federally sponsored anti-terrorism fusion center in Oregon assisted a taskforce monitoring protest groups organizing against a fossil fuel infrastructure project in the state, according to documents obtained by the Guardian. The Oregon Titan Fusion Center – part of a network set up to monitor terrorist activities – disseminated information gathered by that taskforce, and shared information provided by private security attached to the gas project with some of the task force members. Observers, including the American Civil Liberties Union, argue these efforts break Oregon law. Previously, the Guardian revealed the existence of the South-western Oregon Joint Task Force (SWOJTF), a group spearheaded by the Coos county sheriff’s office (CCSO), and its surveillance of those opposing the Jordan Cove energy project: a $10bn proposed liquid natural gas project that would include a new export terminal in Coos Bay, Oregon. The sheriff’s office passed on information harvested from social media accounts and emails to a network of local, state and federal police agencies. In addition to monitoring non-violent protests by Jordan Cove opponents, the SWOJTF has also tracked individuals’ attendance at regulatory hearings and routine campaign emails circulated by grassroots groups such as Southern Oregon Rising Tide, Rogue Climate and 350 Eugene. Chuck Cogburn, who is currently an analyst with the Oregon Titan Fusion Center, has been among the regular recipients of SWOJTF emails, records obtained by the Guardian via open records requests show. On 8 November 2018, Cogburn, who until 2015 also served as the director of the fusion center, responded to an email circulated by the CCSO deputy Bryan Valencia on a pipeline protest at a Medford Chamber of Commerce meeting, by telling Valencia he will “put this out as a SAR”, which fusion centers define as a “suspicious activity report”. In another email on 7 January 2019, Cogburn describes a conversation he had with an Oregon state police detective to addressees including Valencia and the CCSO sergeant Doug Strain. Cogburn remarks that he “gave him an overview of the JCLNG (Jordan Cove LNG project) since 2015”, including “groups involved” and “prior protest activity”. Later, on 22 March, Cogburn forwarded an email from a private firm providing security services for Pembina, the project’s owner, to Valencia and Strain. The initial email read: “There is a protest scheduled in front of our Klamath office next Thursday from 12-2pm. The local Democrat Party dropped the poster below at the chamber office, and then joined the chamber.” It then reproduced the text of a poster for a “block the pipe party” protest held at a theater in Klamath Falls on 5 April.     Leaders from international, national, and Oregon-based organizations have called on Governor Kate Brown to withdraw state cooperation with any surveillance of activists. Photograph: Michael Lloyd/AP    Cogburn forwarded it with the message, “FYI. Not sure if you get these.” The national network of fusion centers were created in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, as focal points for cooperation and information sharing between federal, state and local agencies in detecting and responding to terrorist and criminal activities. In 2018 the House homeland security committee counted 79 fusion centers around the country. In its own materials, the Titan Fusion Center is described as “a collaborative effort of state and federal law enforcement agencies”, focused on “terrorism, organized crime and gang-related criminal activity”. The center also says that it “may retain protected information that is based on a level of suspicion that is less than ‘reasonable suspicion’, such as tips and leads or suspicious activity report (SAR) information”. National fusion center materials say that they “receive information from a variety of sources, including suspicious activity reporting (SAR) information from stakeholders within their jurisdictions, as well as federal information and intelligence”. The center also says that it “will not seek or retain information about an individual or organization solely on the basis of their religious, political, racial, or social views or activities; their participation in a particular non-criminal organization or lawful event”. The center states that its activities are governed by Oregon statutes that prevent the gathering of “information about the political, religious or social views, associations or activities of any individual, group, association, organization, corporation, business or partnership unless such information directly relates to an investigation of criminal activities”. But it is precisely such statutes that observers like the ACLU of Oregon say that SWOJTF, and the fusion center, are breaking. Kelly Simon, an ACLU of Oregon staff attorney, said: “These communications are just more evidence of the Coos county sheriff’s and Titan Fusion Center’s utter disregard for the bedrock principle of freedom of expression and of Oregon’s anti-profiling laws”. National and local environmental leaders agree. Meanwhile, 45 leaders from international, national and Oregon-based organizations sent a letter to Governor Kate Brown on 26 September calling on her to withdraw the state’s cooperation with any surveillance of activists, citing the Guardian’s reporting on the SWOJTF last month. Prominent activists, including Bill McKibben, the founder of 350.org, argued that “monitoring and compiling information about Oregonians’ political or social views, activities, or associations violates Oregon law”, and ask that the governor “protect the civil liberties of your constituents by withdrawing all Oregon resources and participation in the SWOJTF immediately”. University of Southern Maine criminologist Brendan McQuade, the author of a recent book on fusion centers, says fusion centers and other law enforcement taskforces frequently help law agencies get around laws like the one in Oregon. “The structure allows the police to take advantage of the unevenness of the laws in different jurisdictions, by utilizing the differing powers afforded to state, local and federal agencies as part of a flexible overall operation,” McQuade said. Chuck Cogburn, the analyst, did not respond to emailed questions from the Guardian, but his LinkedIn page lists his duties as: “Support Fusion Center operations. Provide analytical support. Produced risk, threat, vulnerability assessment.” At the state level, the center falls under the purview of the Oregon department of justice (DoJ). A DoJ spokesperson did not respond to a detailed request for comment on adding the Medford protest to a SAR, or on the composition of the taskforce. Asked about passing on information from a private firm about the Klamath Falls protest to CCSO, the spokesperson said, “Mr Cogburn forwarded on a notice for an advertised event. It was public information, so it was not considered confidential material.” The Titan Fusion Center has encountered criticism before regarding its monitoring of left-leaning activists on social media. In 2016, a fusion center investigator allegedly violated Oregon law by using a software package, DigitalStakeOut, to monitor the head of the civil rights unit in the Oregon department of justice. In that instance, the investigator used DigitalStakeout to geographically isolate the source of tweets which used the #blacklivesmatter hashtag to the Oregon DoJ headquarters. The tweets had been sent by Erious Johnson, the head of the civil rights unit. Some of the tweets which put Johnson under surveillance were about the hip-hop group Public Enemy. Johnson sued the state over the surveillance, settling in 2017.     The Department of Homeland Security and several fusion centers have claimed the NoDAPL movement has been associated with a rise in ‘environmental rights extremism’. Photograph: Stephanie Keith/Reuters    In 2016, the fusion center investigator, James Williams, said that he had not been aware that Oregon law made his surveillance illegal. Reportedly, it was Cogburn who had arranged for the center to receive the trial of the software which allowed Williams to pinpoint Johnson’s tweets. The CCSO spokesman, Captain Gabriel Fabrizio, has described SWOJTF as having been “created to ensure a multi-agency approach to any and all contingencies. Coos county, due to the potential sighting [sic] of the terminal on the Coos Bay, has been conducting drills and planning regarding all hazards since Jordan Cove has made its intentions known.” In fact, the fusion center appears to have played a key role in setting up the southern Oregon taskforce. In an April 2017 letter to Oregon legislators supporting a boost in Fusion Center funding, the Coos county sheriff, Craig Zanni, wrote that “[t]he Oregon Titan Fusion Center has provided leadership and guidance that is facilitating the formulation of the Southwestern Oregon Joint Task Force.” Zanni wrote in the same letter that the taskforce would “be instrumental in combating the extremist agenda in Southern Oregon”. CCSO did not respond to a detailed request for comment about SWOJTF’s relationship with the fusion center, and what the “extremist agenda” in southern Oregon amounts to. In the wake of the 2016-17 Dakota Access pipeline movement, the Department of Homeland Security and seven state fusion centers produced a nationally circulated bulletin that had similarly claimed the NoDAPL movement has been associated with a rise in “environmental rights extremism”. Lauren Regan, the executive director of the Civil Liberties Defense Center, said labeling of activists as “extremists” is part of a strategy for marginalizing them from potential supporters. “The use of the term ‘extremism’ is a government calling card when it intends to use repressive criminalization against a social movement,” Regan added."
52,terror,Revealed: the true identity of the leader of an American neo-Nazi terror group,"The Guardian has learned the true identity of the leader and founder of the US-based neo-Nazi terror network the Base, which was recently the target of raids by the FBI after an investigation into domestic terrorism uncovered their plans to start a race war. Members of the group stand accused of federal hate crimes, murder plots and firearms offenses, and have harbored international fugitives in recent months. The Base’s leader previously operated under the aliases “Norman Spear” and “Roman Wolf”. Members of the network do not know his true identity due to the group’s culture of internal secrecy. But the Guardian can reveal that “Norman Spear” is in fact US-born Rinaldo Nazzaro, 46, who has a long history of advertising his services as an intelligence, military and security contractor. He has claimed, under his alias, to have served in Russia and Afghanistan. The revelation of his identity comes after a months-long investigation by the Guardian into Nazzaro and the activities of the Base.     The Base’s members stand accused of federal hate crimes. Photograph: Obtained by the Guardian    While Nazzaro’s most recently used address is in New Jersey, there is evidence supporting his claims of being based in Russia, where he lives with his Russian wife. The Base – which is an approximate English translation of “al-Qaida” – began recruiting in late 2018. The white supremacy group, which has regional and international cells, extols the virtues of an all-out race war while specifically targeting African Americans and Jewish people. Using encrypted apps, members of the highly organized group planned terror campaigns; vandalized synagogues; established armed training camps and recruited new members. The US attorney for Maryland, Robert K Hur, speaking after the recent arrest of three members of the Base, said that they “did more than talk – they took steps to act and act violently on their racist views”. Few traces of him exist anywhere Rinaldo Nazzaro has maintained a decidedly low profile: he has no visible presence on any major social media platforms, no published writings under his own name, and no profile in local or national media. Few traces of him exist anywhere, except where a name is required in official business – such as real estate purchases and the registration of companies. Multiple emails and phone calls to Nazzaro went unanswered. But through a painstaking investigation involving freedom of information requests, the analysis of material provided to the Guardian by a whistleblower inside the group, and cross-examination of information found online and in databases, the Guardian was able to piece together his identity and some of his whereabouts. The Guardian was able to unravel Nazzaro’s identity due to his 2018 activities in a remote corner of the Pacific north-west. In chat rooms hosted by the Base, Nazzaro stressed the importance of in-person meet-ups and required members to attend training camps. The Base’s propaganda videos show young men undergoing combat training together in rural areas. Last August, an Oregon-based antifascist group, Eugene Antifa, warned that the Base was planning a “hate camp” in the neighboring state of Washington, and claimed Nazzaro (operating under the alias of “Spear”) had purchased land in Stevens county for training purposes. This warning came after a leak of the Base’s internal chats.    The neo-Nazi group called &quot;The Base&quot; is planning a &#39;hate camp&#39; this month in Washington. Members are flying in from around the country to Spokane, WA this August to participate in the gathering.#DeBasedDoxx [THREAD] pic.twitter.com/L7M59zoaYn&mdash; EUG161 (@161EUG) August 5, 2019    Local media outlets picked up the story, which led local law enforcement to urgently seek information on the group. In emails obtained by the Guardian via public records request, the Stevens county Sheriff, Brad Manke, is seen contacting the FBI and the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) for advice on the group. On 20 August 2019, Manke writes to an FBI agent, asking: “Do you have a name for the actual head of the group The Base or the address where the property actually is?” In a 20 September email responding to an SPLC researcher, Manke writes: “I have since learned that ‘The Base’ has purchased property in Ferry County, WA which is a neighboring county.” Property record searches revealed that three 10-acre blocks of undeveloped land were purchased in December 2018 for $33,000 in the name of a Delaware LLC called “Base Global”. In a telephone conversation in late November, Manke confirmed that this was the block of land he had been referring to. In recordings of two internal Base voice calls provided to the Guardian by the source, “Norman Spear” discusses his recent land purchase. When asked why the land had been inexpensive, he replied: “Because there’s no possibility of getting utilities in there. Ever.” He continued: “But to me, that was a good thing for my purposes. I looked at it like it was just naturally secluded.” In deeds of sale, the address provided for the company was a New Jersey post office – enough to conceal the purchaser’s identity. But separate tax affidavits associated with the purchase give a different address for Base Global. That address is for a New Jersey apartment that has belonged to an older family member of Nazzaro since 1998. Nazzaro and his wife have also intermittently resided at that address, according to database searches. The affidavits are also signed by Nazzaro, and dated “12/21/2018 Republic”. Republic is the seat and the only city in Ferry county, Washington. According to a source inside the Base, this date coincided with a trip by Russia-based “Norman Spear” to the United States, during which time he had in-person meetings with members of the group. Speculation that Nazzaro was a federal agent The location of the land is consistent with “Norman Spear’s” advocacy of a white supremacist strategy called the Northwest Territorial Imperative (NTI), which was promoted by the deceased white supremacist Harold Covington. The strategy argues for the creation of a separatist ethnostate in the Pacific north-west and encourages white supremacists to move to the region. In one of “Norman Spear’s” first public appearances, on a far-right podcast recorded in December 2017, he was introduced as a Northwest Front (another white supremacist separatist group) organizer and went on to spell out a four-state plan culminating in “achieving independence, realizing the ultimate goal which is an independent nation state in the Pacific north-west, an ethnostate”. The plan, he said, would trigger the relocation to the Pacific north-west of the white population in the United States. Around the same time, “Spear” filmed a series of short instructional presentations on the tactics and strategy of guerrilla warfare. In an archive of those videos on the site Bitchute, which hosts a large amount of far-right content, he is identified as “Defense Studies expert and former CIA field intelligence officer Norman Spear”. This detail, coupled with other leads, compelled many to speculate whether “Norman Spear” was, in fact, a federal agent operating inside the Base. The Base has emerged at a time when far-right organizing is on the rise in the US. Last year saw a spate of terror attacks by white supremacists. In August, the gunman who killed 22 people at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, is believed to have posted a white nationalist manifesto online prior to the attack. In April, an attacker who killed one person after opening fire inside a San Diego synagogue killing posted a note online citing white supremacy influences and naming the gunman who killed 51 in an attack on a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, as an inspiration. “We have a significant increase in racially motivated violent extremism in the United States and, I think, a growing increase in white nationalism and white supremacy extremist movements,” Jay Tabb, the head of national security for the FBI, said at an event in Washington recently. Under the motto “there is no political solution”, the Base embraces an “accelerationist” ideology, which holds that acts of violence and terror are required in order to push liberal democracy towards collapse, preparing the way for white supremacists to seize power and institute an ethnostate. Members remained defiant following the arrest of seven alleged members of the group in mid-January, calling it “an unjust political witch hunt” from the “Liberal Globalist System”. Was the Base a honeypot designed to entrap people? Beginning in 2009 and until as late as 2019, Nazzaro billed himself as an intelligence expert working with various government and military agencies. Nazzaro is the principal of an LLC called Omega Solutions International (OSI), a company offering a range of intelligence and security contracting. Its website, which was removed from the Internet some time after August 2019, boasted of the firm’s “experience conducting intelligence analysis for government agencies, military organizations, and private businesses”, as well as access to a network of seasoned security professionals with expertise in counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, homeland security, hostage rescue/negotiations, psychological operations, and more. The firm also has a Cage Code, which is an administrative requirement for military and government contractors. Materials inspected and sources consulted by the Guardian indicate that Nazzaro, as “Spear”, has faced persistent suspicions from current and former members of the group that he is a “fed”, or the agent of a foreign government, or that the Base is a “honeypot” intended to lure neo-Nazis out into the open for the benefit of law enforcement agencies. Former members have cited this as a reason for leaving. A connection with Russia New York marriage records show that Nazzaro and his wife were married in New York City in 2012, during the period when Nazzaro is recorded as maintaining a midtown Manhattan address. At that time, he was recorded as having one child. A Russian site that scrapes and archives social media accounts had captured a profile, and photos, posted by Nazzaro’s Russian-born wife to VK, the Russian social media site.     An early photograph of Nazzaro, dated 1994. Photograph: The Villanovan    She has since hidden that profile, but other social media archives confirm the prior existence of an account in Nazzaro’s wife’s name (using her married name). The photographs show the same person who has been presenting himself as “Norman Spear”. Meanwhile, a reverse image search yielded a photograph matching public photos of “Norman Spear” atop advertisements for English lessons in St Petersburg, Russia. The Guardian was only able to find one earlier photograph attached to his real name. It appeared above a vox pop in the Villanovan, the student paper of Catholic, Pennsylvania-based Villanova University, in 1994. At the time of the photograph, “Ron Nazzaro” was described as a junior in philosophy, which is consistent with a 1973 birthdate. A source who has met “Spear” in person believes that the 1994 photo of Nazzaro is the same person he met. A “Rinaldo Nazzaro” is also identified as a class of 1991 alumnus and donor of the prestigious New Jersey Catholic prep school the Delbarton School. Nazzaro’s approximate age, his Italian heritage, his family’s New Jersey location, his background in “counter-intelligence”, the nationality of his spouse, and the number of his children were relayed to the Guardian as characteristics of “Norman Spear” by an internally placed source. ‘I am on the terrorism watchlist’ Richard Tobin, a Base member, is awaiting trial in New Jersey over allegations that he coordinated the September vandalism of synagogues in Michigan and Wisconsin. In a December custody hearing, the prosecuting assistant US attorney cited Tobin’s self-professed belief that “Norman Spear” was a Russian spy. The Guardian has discovered that all of the business addresses associated with Nazzaro’s OSI LLCs are “virtual offices”. This describes a situation where a second company provides a business address, and sometimes meeting rooms and greeting services, for businesses who do not wish to maintain their own premises. The addresses are often prestigious: OSI’s virtual address locations include Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and K Street in Washington DC, an address associated with federal government contracting and lobbying. Meanwhile, “Norman Spear” appears to have had no extended history in the neo-Nazi movement before emerging as leader of the Base. According to an internally placed source, the only people within the movement who vouched for “Spear” were connected to the Northwest Front (NWF). The NWF founder, Harold Covington, was himself the subject of persistent rumors within the white nationalist movement that he was a federal informant, and that NWF was itself a honeypot – a front organization routinely used by US law enforcement in order to entrap people. “Norman Spear” has told Base members that he remains in Russia. Law enforcement sources have indicated on background that Nazzaro is believed by some agencies to be working for the Russian government. The US government may have been monitoring “Norman Spear’s” activities for some time. In the April conversation planning a meetup in July, “Spear” was concerned that he would not be able to attend. “I have confirmed that I am on the FBI terrorism watch list. I mean, that doesn’t really matter in the context of the training. What matters is that I’m on it.” The Guardian’s investigation of the group continues."
53,terror,Hotel Mumbai review – unflinching but uncertain terror-attack thriller,"To grapple most directly with this brutalising century, what the movies have generated so far is the based-on-true-atrocities cycle initiated by Paul Greengrass’s United 93. It now churns out Australian director Anthony Maras’s middling Hotel Mumbai. In its unflinching, often virtuosic carnage, the cycle may be as close as the commercial cinema has been allowed to get to the new extreme cinema that was so in vogue across Europe as the planes struck the World Trade Center.  Maras’s film demonstrates how, without Greengrass’s time-stamped precision, such projects can assume an air of the blandly composite – and even of the generic disaster movie, undercutting any seriousness of intent. The onlookers to this recreation of the November 2008 attack on Mumbai’s Taj Mahal hotel seem a very Irwin Allen-like ragbag. Waiter Dev Patel and chef Anupam Kher represent the locals, while the guests are rugged architect Armie Hammer, his mutely beautiful wife Nazanin Boniadi and shady Russian Jason Isaacs (the latter introduced inquiring as to the size of an escort’s nipples). Maras and co-writer John Collee spy something positive in the enforced bonding of these disparate types, but the bodycount flattens the homilies. For an hour, Maras maintains a basic hide-and-seek tension, as his players sporadically break cover to bundle themselves into pantries and linen closets, and he makes attempts to humanise the killers. It’s just uneasy viewing in many ways: rotely mechanical in its conversion of suffering into set pieces, morally questionable as it inserts authentic, blood-spattered cameraphone footage into fictional activity. The action increasingly bears the rehearsed, prosaic look of an extended evacuation drill. Art born of outrage has to be more rigorous – and we might also contemplate what merit there is in guaranteeing prospective terrorists a filmed account of their misdeeds. • Hotel Mumbai opens in the UK on 27 September.

54,terror,"Terror, hope, anger, kindness: the complexity of life as we face the new normal","When we come to write the history of climate politics in Australia, it’s possible New Year’s Eve 2019 will be seen as the moment everything changed. That was the day the nation – and indeed the world – watched in horror and despair as the people of Mallacoota fled to the beach to escape the wall of flame bearing down on their town. 
They weren’t the only ones fleeing the fire that day. In towns from the Blue Mountains to the outskirts of Melbourne, communities were facing catastrophe. But there was something about the images from Mallacoota, the crowds of people and animals huddled on the sand in the eerie red light that somehow brought not just the scale but the uncanniness of the crisis home. “When Brueghel meets the Anthropocene,” a friend of mine tweeted about similar scenes in Malua Bay. More like Bosch, others replied.

It’s possible the reasons these images seem so resonant is the fact they are on a beach, a place that occupies a curious duality in Australian culture, serving as both the most potent symbol of our national myth of egalitarianism and a theatre for our deepest anxieties about both our nation’s origins and the possibility of invasion, whether by aggressors or by refugees.

As if to underline that ambivalence, another image appeared not long afterwards. Taken by Mallacoota resident Allison Marion, it showed her 11-year-old son, Finn, seated in the stern of a dinghy, one hand on the tiller of an outboard engine, his eyes above the mask that obscures his face wary and exhausted. Behind him the sky is deep orange, the sea barely visible through the murk. A decade-and-a-half ago the writer Robert Macfarlane wondered why the climate crisis lacked an iconography. It has one now. 
But it’s difficult not to suspect New Year’s Eve was also the moment many Australians realised we were in uncharted territory, that the future so many of us had feared for so long had finally washed over us, and we were completely unprepared. 
The catastrophe that is still playing out on the eastern seaboard, South Australia and Tasmania has been a long time coming yet still the sheer scale of it is difficult to comprehend. At the time of writing 27 people have been killed, and an estimated 8.4 million hectares have burned or are currently burning, an area larger than the whole of Ireland or Austria. More than 1,800 homes have been destroyed, along with many agricultural sheds and structures, and with them, lives and livelihoods. Thousands of people have been evacuated, and many more stranded for days or even longer with limited food, fuel or electricity.

The impact on livestock has also been horrifying. The National Farmers’ Federation estimates in excess of 100,000 sheep and cattle have been killed, and hundreds of thousands more will have to be euthanised in coming days. The Australian defence force has been mobilised to deal with their carcasses – “to dig the pits”, as the federal agriculture minister, Bridget McKenzie, put it earlier this week. 
But the human and economic cost of the fires is dwarfed by their ecological impact. Scientists estimate close to half a billion mammals, birds and reptiles have been killed in NSW alone, driving threatened animals and birds closer to extinction. Speaking to Guardian Australia on 4 January, Prof Sarah Legge, a conservation ecologist at the Australian National University, said: “Even some species that are not snuffed out completely will struggle in the coming months. I think this is the end for a number of species.”

In many cases burned areas will never recover. Endangered plant species confined to small areas are likely to have been wiped out; likewise the sheer intensity of the fires will have destroyed not just the complex and highly diverse communities of organisms that populate the forest floor, but also the old-growth trees that shelter species such as gliding possums and provide nesting sites for many birds. As biologist Prof John Woinarski of Charles Darwin University put it: “There are no winners … These fires are homogenising the landscape. They benefit no species.”

Rolling disasters 
Away from the fires the impact has also been considerable. In Sydney, the city has been shrouded in smoke since early November, the stink of burning constantly in the air. Breathing masks have become a common sight on the streets. My younger daughter’s school began keeping the children in at lunchtime. On one of the worst days a friend of mine who is an anaesthetist at one of Sydney’s major hospitals texted me to say they had been forced to cancel his surgeries because the air conditioners were pulling too much smoke into the operating room. In the city, fire crews were run ragged responding to fire alarms set off by the smoke, sending office workers spilling on to the streets. In Canberra, where the smoke has intensified in recent weeks, things are even worse: flights have been cancelled due to poor visibility, government departments have told workers to remain at home, and the National Gallery was forced to close due to fears about the smoke’s effect on its collections. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
Amid the rolling emergency of the fires it’s easy to forget they are only the latest in a long line of disasters. Last summer fires tore through rainforest in north Queensland and devastated forests in Tasmania, while on the Barwon-Darling millions of fish and other riverine species died as a result of drought and long-term mismanagement of river systems – catastrophes that were followed by catastrophic floods in northern Queensland that killed four people and drowned up to half a million cattle. 
 
  
  If we are to find a way forward we will need kindness as well as anger, empathy as well as rage, humility as well as righteousness 
  
 
Overseas the story is the same. In the middle of last year, fires spread through the Arctic, igniting not just grassland but boreal peatlands dried out by unusually high temperatures in the region. In Brazil fires destroyed nearly 10,000 sq km of rainforest, prompting warnings from scientists that the Amazon is now close to a tipping point, beyond which its collapse will be unstoppable. In March Cyclone Idai left more than 1,300 people dead in Madagascar, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. Indeed one report by British charity Christian Aid suggests the changing climate amplified the effects of no less than 15 major disasters in 2019, while in July last year the UN warned climate change is now causing an average of one disaster a week. 
There has been a lot of talk about adapting to the new normal in recent weeks. But this is not the new normal. This is just the beginning. The rolling disasters we are now experiencing are the result of 1C of warming above pre-industrial averages. Even if the commitments enshrined in the Paris agreement are met – something that looks extremely unlikely – we are on track for well over 2C of warming by the end of the century, while on current trends we are headed for 3C or 4C. 
A world that is 3C or 4C hotter will be almost unrecognisable. Large areas in equatorial and subequatorial regions will be effectively uninhabitable. Sea levels will rise by many metres. Ecosystems around the world will collapse, causing mass extinctions on land and in the oceans. Hundreds of millions of people will die, while hundreds of millions more will be displaced.

Even at 2C our world will be irrevocably altered. According to the IPCC’s special report,  Global Warming of 1.5C, released in October 2018, 2C of warming will lead to significant increases in both the incidence and severity of heatwaves and extreme weather events, dramatically affect food production, especially in south-east Asia, south and central America and sub-Saharan Africa, leading to a “rapid evacuation” of people from tropical countries. Tropical diseases will spread into formerly temperate areas. Sea levels will rise by up to a metre by 2100, and continue rising for centuries afterwards. The impacts on the natural world will be similarly devastating: extinction rates will soar, ocean acidification and warming waters will devastate marine life and coral reefs will disappear almost entirely within a decade or two. 
In fact, the IPCC’s advice is that to have any hope of avoiding dangerous climate change, we must hold warming to only 1.5C above pre-industrial averages. At 1.5C, the world will be a much harder, less hospitable place than the one we once knew. Heatwaves, droughts and disasters like those of recent weeks will be more commonplace. Shortages of food and water will affect only half as many people as they will at 2C, and the number of people displaced might be held to only 50 million. Natural systems and biodiversity will be irreparably damaged, but we might save 10% of coral reefs, and sea level rise might be held to only half a metre by 2100. 
This is not an accident

As best-case scenarios go, this is pretty bleak. But it gets worse. Because in order to have any chance of holding warming to 1.5C, net global emissions need to reach zero by 2050, with close to half that reduction taking place over the next 10 years. This isn’t going to be achieved by installing solar panels or making meat-free Monday part of our lives. It demands the transformation of every aspect of our economies and societies in the space of a few years. In a world where emissions are still rising year on year, where rightwing populism is on the march and the international order looks shakier by the day, the odds of this happening look vanishingly unlikely. 
The brutal truth, in other words, is that things are going to get worse whatever we do. A lot worse. And probably quickly. 
None of this is a secret, yet individually and collectively we have grown skilled at not thinking about it. After all, how could we? Acknowledging the truth would demand we recognise not just the scale of the problem and its intractability, but also our part in it. The writer Amitav Ghosh has described this elision of reality as “the great derangement”. Yet with each new freak weather event or shattered record or unprecedented disaster, it has become harder to keep pretending things are OK, harder to keep the sense of rising panic at bay.

As the old joke goes, denial is a mighty river. Yet even it has its limits. Fifty years ago the American psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross identified what she believed to be the five stages of grieving. First comes denial, then anger, bargaining, depression and finally acceptance. These stages are not necessarily clear-cut – witness the growing anger of the millions of people who joined climate marches around the world in recent months – but I suspect that for many people New Year’s Day was the point where denial finally stopped being an option, and their grief and terror finally coalesced into fury.

We should be angry, of course. Incandescently angry. Because where we are is not an accident. It is the result of decades of inaction by our political leaders, of campaigns of lies and disinformation by fossil fuel companies and their enablers in politics and the media, of pandering to special interests and privileging greed over the futures of our children. In any other field, people who knowingly ignored expert scientific advice would be held liable for the death and destruction that flowed from their actions. Yet our prime minister, the leader of a party that has done more to prevent action on climate change in this country than any other, a party that systematically ignored warnings from fire chiefs and scientific agencies in the lead-up to the disaster and was, even as the country burned, working to reduce emission reduction targets at the Madrid climate summit, refuses to countenance changes to his government’s climate policies. 
How do we live when reality sinks in? 
But the real question is what do we do when the anger subsides? How do we live once our disbelief at the scale of the disaster fades and we are left to grapple with the knowledge the world we knew has gone? Climate scientist Joëlle Gergis has written about her increasing tendency to burst into tears, as “the reality of what the science is saying manages to thaw the emotionally frozen part of myself I need to maintain to do my job. In those moments, what surfaces is pure grief”.

Kübler-Ross’ model grew out of her experiences with the terminally ill, but our predicament is not entirely dissimilar. There is no magic bullet or miracle cure that will save us. We cannot make this better. Instead we face a future in which the only certainty is uncertainty and loss, a future in which the choices we have made will shape the lives of generations to come for centuries, and mostly for the worst. 
Faced with this reality we can sink into depression and despair. Or we can go further, admit the old world has gone, and begin to fight to make things better. This will not be easy. As the intransigence of Scott Morrison and his government and the organised campaigns of disinformation about the causes of the fires already circulating on social media demonstrate, the forces opposing change are powerful, and will fight to the end. 
But there are other forces at work as well. As if to underline the historic failure of the federal government, it was ordinary people who stepped into the breach in the aftermath of the fires, offering money, food, places to stay. I can’t have been the only one moved to tears by the sight of truckies and tradies gathering in Bairnsdale to help residents and holidaymakers stranded in the Gippsland, or the images of members of the Muslim community in New South Wales and Victoria who travelled hundreds of kilometres to cook food for exhausted firefighters and shattered communities. “We can’t fight fires but we can put a barbecue on,” one of the men told the ABC.

Their actions are a reminder that if we are to find a way forward we will need kindness as well as anger, empathy as well as rage, humility as well as righteousness. Yet we also need to recognise that just as acceptance frees the terminally ill, it can liberate us to imagine a way forward. The philosopher Donna Haraway speaks of the imperative of “staying with the trouble”, of not shying away from reality but instead inhabiting the present in all its complexity, terror, hope and joy and recognising our kinship with those around us. Perhaps it is time we all learned to do that, time we learned to recognise our own hopes and fears in other people. 
Because that is what many of us glimpsed in the faces of the people on the beach in Mallacoota on New Year’s Eve. We saw ourselves, our shared future, the terror and pain of what is coming. And we could no longer look away.

55,terror,Counter-terrorism policy is a threat to democracy,"We are deeply concerned at the inclusion of peaceful campaigning organisations in a counter-terrorism police document distributed to NHS trusts, schools and safeguarding boards (Report, 18 January). The suggestion that campaigning for peace, environmental justice, human rights and animal rights, and against racism, should be regarded by those safeguarding the public as extremist activities is grotesque. This provides yet more evidence of the threat posed to core democratic values, including free speech, by the government’s counter-terrorism agenda. This document must be immediately rescinded. But there is also an urgent need for a full, and proper independent review of the Prevent strategy. More widely, we collectively support the demands of the Network for Police Monitoring’s Protest Is Not Extremism campaign, which calls on the police to stop categorising campaigning and protest activities as “domestic extremism”, for a clear separation of protest policing from counter-terrorism, and for better protection for campaigners against surveillance. This must include independent oversight of how the police use surveillance in relation to political protest. These proposed measures are essential to defend our right to political engagement and peaceful protest – and indeed to defend democracy.Kate Hudson General secretary, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Ben Jamal Director, Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Lindsey German Convener, Stop the War Coalition, John Sauven Executive director, Greenpeace UK, Isobel Hutchinson Director, Animal Aid, Weyman Bennett Co-convener, Unite Against Fascism, Sabby Dhalu Joint secretary, Stand Up to Racism, Jane Tallents Trident Ploughshares, Angie Zelter XR Peace • How have we got to the point where those campaigning for environmental justice are now regarded by the state as potential terrorists? One answer to this is that this is not a new phenomenon. For decades, state agents and politicians of both major parties have sought to extend the definition of subversion – as Merlyn Rees, the former Labour home secretary, did in 1978. In 1981, a former senior police officer, Harold Salisbury, defined subversion as “anyone who shows affinity towards communism, that’s common sense, the IRA, the PLO and I would say anyone who’s decrying marriage, family life, trying to break that up, pushing drugs, homosexuality, indiscipline in schools, weak penalties for anti- social crimes … a whole gamut of things that could be pecking away at the foundations of our society and weakening it”. In fact, it is the views of those like Rees and Salisbury, and their contemporary equivalents, not the attitudes of those engaging in perfectly lawful activities, which are undermining and pecking away at the democratic foundations of this country. Such attitudes and pronouncements are designed to discourage popular participation in democratic action for fear of being labelled domestic terrorists. Is there any other country in the world, which claims to be democratic, where those campaigning against badger culling have been placed on a terror list? Even having to ask this question clearly illustrates the further intensification in the authoritarianism of the state.Prof Joe SimSchool of Justice Studies, Liverpool John Moores University • The only surprise about police monitoring the likes of Greenpeace should be that anyone is surprised. Those of us with longer memory and experience know that the police and their co-workers, special branch, MI5 etc, have always treated members of such groups as dangerous radicals and extremists to be watched. In the 1980s I was a member of Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and CND; I was illegally detained and photographed at a peaceful demonstration where the police, mostly not local, were under the direction of a special branch officer. I expect I have a file somewhere, which will have to be dusted off when I chain my Zimmer frame to the railings in protest at the importation of chlorinated chicken.Andrew GoldSeaton, Devon • On Monday three of my friends from Manchester XR presented themselves at their local police station to register as potential “terrorists”.

56,terror,German police arrest members of far-right group after state ban,"German police have raided properties in 10 states and arrested members of a far-right group after it was banned by the government. The United German Peoples and Tribes organisation belongs to the broader Reichsbürger or Citizens of the Reich movement, which rejects the authority of the modern German state and is driven by conspiracy theories. It is armed and considered extremely dangerous, the police said. An interior ministry spokesman said on Thursday that its fight against rightwing extremism would not be halted even during the current global health emergency. “For the first time, the interior ministry has banned a Reichsbürger group,” the spokesman said. “Even in these days of crisis, we will continue to fight far-right extremism, racism and antisemitism. Herbert Reul, the interior minister of the state of Nordrhein-Westfalen, where the group had its focus, said: “These people cannot consider themselves safe even in these times of the coronavirus.” He said he was grateful to the federal interior minister, Horst Seehofer, “for allowing us to proceed against this brown sauce”, in a reference to their Nazi-sympathies. He described the group as a danger to society. “These people deny the existence of the Federal Republic of Germany and agitate against Jews and foreigners,” said Reul. “This is the right moment to go after people who spread such conspiracy theories. There is no tolerance towards them, only a hard line of action.” Similar to the sovereign citizen movement in the US, the Reichsbürger movement rejects the modern state, arguing that Germany is not a country but a company. They refuse to recognise German laws, evade taxes and fines and have their own currency. They also mix Holocaust denial with conspiracy theories. Police seized, computers, weapons and ammunition, baseball bats, propaganda literature and drugs during the dawn raids, officers said. The group has a core membership of just 21 people nationwide, and a further 100 followers. The wider movement counts thousands more members, most of whom are males between 40 and 60 years old. Sensitivity toward the group’s existence has grown since the terror attack last month in the city of Hanau when a suspected extremist shot dead nine people, all of whom were from migrant backgrounds. The gunman was not a member of the group, but shared certain tendencies with its members. After the shooting, Seehofer declared war on the far-right extremist scene. He said it was the biggest security threat Germany faced and that it had left a “trail of blood” across Germany in recent months. An antisemitic attack on a synagogue in Halle in October and the murder of a pro-refugee politician at his home last June have also heightened awareness of the phenomenon. Seehofer announced an increase in police measures as a result, including more resources to fight extremism online, and has signalled a willingness to tighten gun ownership laws."
57,terror,Terror legislation watchdog rejects call to change treason laws,"Proposals to renew treason laws in a bid to tackle Britons who fight on behalf of extremist groups or enemy states should be rejected, the terror legislation watchdog has said in his inaugural speech in the role. Jonathan Hall QC, who was appointed as an independent reviewer of terrorism legislation in May, said treason laws, which date back to 1351, should be left alone. In May, the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, said he had asked officials to consider the case for updating treason legislation. His comments came after a right-leaning thinktank, Policy Exchange, advocated renewing treason laws to prosecute Britons who betray the country through acts of terror. However, Hall told an audience at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in central London that terrorists “might welcome the risk of prosecution for treason as a badge of honour.  “Whether the mere existence of a law of treason might encourage actual terrorist attacks is debatable,” he said.   Related: Foiled terrorist attacks on UK soil have risen to 22, says top officer    “But surely Islamic State would savour the opportunity to say that true allegiance is owed to them, not to the United Kingdom. We are in are deep waters, yet in my view, these are objections which are insufficiently answered to justify a new offence.” Hall said a treason offence would “risk politicising and complicating criminal prosecutions with arguably limited benefits”. The last person to be convicted under treason laws was William Joyce, more commonly known as Lord Haw-Haw, who was hanged in 1946 for assisting Nazi Germany. The Policy Exchange report proposed using a new power for the secretary of state to “proclaim” that a state or organisation is engaged in attacking the UK in order to subject them to treason laws. Hall challenged this mechanism. “What messages would proclaiming a group as an enemy engaged in an armed attack against the UK send?” he argued. “International humanitarian law, or the law of armed conflict, is based principally around conflict between states. “Whilst there are some rules that apply in conflicts that are not between states, there is a natural and obvious reluctance to accord members of armed groups the same status as soldiers or combatants of a foreign state, for example, by treating them as prisoners of war rather than criminals.” The watchdog also questioned the usefulness of the government’s heavily touted “designated area” powers, which passed into legislation earlier this year. The powers allow a home secretary to ban British citizens and residents from a specific geographic area, with a breach of a designation punishable by up to 10 years. Hall said the powers had yet to be applied to a specific area – despite Javid announcing in May that he had asked officials to look at designating north-east Syria. “What remains to be seen is the utility of this designation power now that the caliphate has fallen and so-called Islamic State has reverted to a more traditional clandestine terrorist group operating through networks of individuals rather than through occupation of territory,” Hall added. The government estimates that about 900 people have travelled from the UK to engage with the conflict in Syria and Iraq, including foreign terrorist fighters who have joined Islamic State. Speaking in May, Javid said: “I have … asked my officials to consider the case for updating treason laws. Our definition of terrorism is probably broad enough to cover those who betray our country by supporting terror abroad. “But if updating the old offence of treason would help us to counter hostile state activity, then there is merit in considering that too.”"
58,terror,Police search Middlesbrough properties after arrest of terror suspect,"Bomb disposal experts were called to a home in Middlesbrough on Saturday after the arrest of a man in north London on suspicion of terrorism offences. The 21-year-old, from the Middlesbrough area, is suspected of involvement in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism contrary to section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Four properties across England are being searched as a result of the intelligence-led operation – one in London, one in the Middlesbrough suburb of Teesville and two others elsewhere in the town. “Following the discovery of some potentially suspicious items at the address in Teesville, EOD [explosive ordnance disposal] have been in attendance at the property to provide specialist advice. There has been no evacuation of local residents at this time,” Cleveland police said in a statement. Police arrived at the house on The Avenue in Teesville on Saturday at 10.30am to secure the property, and officers in riot gear were later seen by neighbours entering the property. Bomb disposal teams were called in after the discovery of potentially suspicious items on Saturday evening. Photographs on Teesside Live showed officers guarding the shed at the end of the garden. A resident told the website locals had been scared after receiving no information about the operation. “I asked four times for information,” she said. “Next minute the bomb disposal van came. It was scary. We were told nothing, just not to worry. Nothing like this happens round here.” Supt Dave Sutherland from Cleveland police said: “I know that the nature of this police activity will be concerning to residents in our local communities, and I want to reassure people that public safety is our main priority. “You will see increased patrols from our neighbourhood teams and I would ask anyone with concerns to speak to these officers. The activity is intelligence-led and pre-planned and we are working closely with our colleagues from counter-terrorism policing north-east. “Our aim is to keep people as updated and informed as we are able to given the sensitive nature of this investigation. We appreciate the public’s patience and understanding while we carry out this work.” The suspect remains in custody."
59,terror,"No terrorism offenders to be released without review, says minister","The government has responded to the knife attack in Streatham by announcing sweeping legal changes to prevent the automatic release of terrorist offenders. 
In a hastily arranged House of Commons statement a day after the south London stabbings, the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, set out plans for emergency legislation that would stop any terror offenders being released without parole board risk assessments. 
And in a move that is likely to face legal challenge, Buckland said that the proposals would apply to existing as well as future offenders, meaning prisoners currently due for release halfway through their sentence could now face years more in prison. 
The move – which critics view as a breach of norms governing retrospective legislation – came in response to the revelation that neither the police nor the parole board were able to stop the release one week ago of 20-year-old Sudesh Amman, who was shot dead by plainclothes officers after he stabbed two people in south London. 
The government faced immediate accusations of developing policy on the hoof, ignoring the crisis in prisons and scapegoating “the influence of lawyers” on sentencing policy through anonymous briefings. 
But Buckland hinted that the government might push for even more draconian powers that would prevent prisoners convicted of terror offences being released until the Parole Board considered them to pose no risk. 
 
 Graphic 
 
Announcing the changes, the justice secretary told the House of Commons: “Yesterday’s appalling incident makes the case plainly for immediate action. We cannot have the situation, as we saw tragically in yesterday’s case, where an offender – a known risk to innocent members of the public – is released early by automatic process of law without any oversight by the Parole Board. 
“We will be doing everything we can to protect the public, that is our primary duty. We will, therefore, introduce emergency legislation to ensure an end to terrorist offenders getting released automatically having served half of their sentence with no check or review. 
“The underlying principle has to be that offenders will no longer be released early automatically and that any release before the end of their sentence will be dependent on risk assessment by the Parole Board. 
“We face an unprecedented situation of severe gravity, and as such it demands the government responds immediately and that this legislation will apply to serving prisoners.” 
All terrorist offenders would have to serve two thirds of their sentence before being eligible for a Parole Board assessment, Buckland added. 
Hinting that further restrictive regimes may be introduced, he said: “We will review whether the current maximum penalties and sentencing framework for terrorist offences is indeed sufficient or comprehensive on the underlying principle that terrorist offenders should no longer be released until the Parole Board is satisfied that they are no longer a risk to the public.” 
The changes are unlikely to affect many prisoners as a significant number are already serving either life sentences or extended determinate sentences, both of which require Parole Board intervention before release. A small number of terrorist offenders, like Amman, are sentenced to standard determinate sentences that under current legislation are eligible for automatic release at the halfway point. 
The proposals come a week after a broad package of counter-terrorism measures was announced by the Home Office and Ministry of Justice, which included plans to introduce lie detector tests for terrorist offenders as well as the recruitment of specialist counter-terrorism probation officers. 
Among the proposals, some of which are to be introduced in a new counter-terrorism bill, are plans to end early release on licence for terrorist offenders who receive extended determinate sentences and a mandatory minimum of 14 years in prison for those convicted of preparing acts of terrorism or directing a terrorist organisation. 
Clare Collier, advocacy director for Liberty, the civil liberties and human rights group, immediately questioned the legality of a retrospective change to sentence conditions. 
She said: “The government’s response to recent terror attacks is a cause of increasing concern for our civil liberties. 
“From last month’s kneejerk lie detector proposal, to today’s threat to break the law by changing people’s sentences retrospectively, continuing to introduce measures without review or evidence is dangerous and will create more problems than it solves. 
“It’s clear the UK’s counter-terror system is in chaos and desperately needs proper scrutiny and review.” 
Joanna Cherry, the justice and home affairs spokesperson for the SNP at Westminster, immediately highlighted difficulties with retrospectively altering legislation. 
She said: “He [Buckland] has said he intends to introduce emergency legislation making retrospective provision in relation to those sentenced before the law was changed I wonder can he assure me that the usual legal difficulties with retrospective legislation have been addressed to his satisfaction.” 
Buckland argued that the changes related to the “administration” of a sentence, not its length or type. He said: “We are talking about the administration of a sentence – the way it is dealt with, as opposed to the length of it or the type of it. I think for that reason looking at the administration of a sentence is entirely appropriate and what I would regard as a reasonable approach.” 
Cherry hit out at reports that an anonymous No 10 source had been briefing journalists that “the system for dealing with terrorism has significant problems because of the shocking influence of lawyers on policy”. 
“Will [Buckland] join me in condemning these anonymous briefings and will he agree with me that there’s plenty of room for introducing robust anti-terrorism policies that are rule-of-law compliant?” 
Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, attacked the state of the prison and probation service amid questions raised over the effectiveness of rehabilitation in prison and monitoring terror suspects in the community. 
“Our priority must be to keep the public safe. But to be clear, the government cannot use sentencing as a way of distracting from their record of bringing the criminal justice system to breaking point.”

In a statement, the Parole Board said: “Given the recent events at London Bridge and Streatham, the Parole Board understands and welcomes the government’s plans to ensure that terrorist offenders are not released automatically, as occurred in these incidents, but are instead considered by an independent panel of the Parole Board. 
“Our overriding priority is the protection of the public. The independent Parole Board will not direct the release of an offender unless we are satisfied, taking account of all the evidence, that detention is no longer necessary for the protection of the public. 
“The board’s focus is rightly on those who have committed the most serious criminal offences and it is vital that the most serious offenders are subject to a proper assessment before their release.”"
60,terror,French police launch terrorism inquiry after two killed in stabbing,"French counter-terrorism police are to investigate a stabbing attack in which two people were killed and five injured. A 33-year-old Sudanese asylum seeker was arrested after the attack at Romans-sur-Isère, in the Drôme department in south-east France, on Saturday morning. Two other men, both said to be from Sudan, one of whom shared a flat with the suspect, are also being questioned in police custody. The national counter-terrorism brigade, PNAT, announced on Saturday evening that it had opened an investigation into “killings and attempted killings connected to a terrorist organisation” and “criminal terrorist conspiracy”. The suspect, who arrived in France in 2017 and was granted refugee status and given a 10-year residency permit, moved to Romans-sur-Isère in January after two years in Moras-en-Valloire, to the north, where he worked in a leather goods store. Aurélien Ferlay, the mayor of Moras-en-Valloire, told French television that the man had undergone professional training in leatherwork supported by social services and the charity Secours Catholique. Ferlay said he was “both stupefied and horrified by this attack”, which he said had left everyone “totally mystified”. “Nothing, absolutely nothing, made us think he would carry out this terrible act. He went to work on his bicycle, he was polite with my staff and me and he posed absolutely no problem in our community,” Ferlay said. The local newspaper, the Dauphiné Libéré, said the man had been working in a factory at Romans-sur-Isère, a town of 33,000 residents, and was unknown to French and European police and the security services. A statement from the counter-terrorism prosecutor’s officer said a search of the suspect’s apartment had uncovered “handwritten documents with religious connotations”. It said the as yet unidentified author of the documents “complains in particular that he lives in a country of sinners”. The suspect entered a tobacconist shop on Saturday morning and allegedly attacked the owner and injured the shopkeeper’s wife when she tried to help her husband. He then went to a nearby butcher’s where witnesses said he jumped over the counter, grabbed another knife and stabbed a customer before running out and attacking passersby in the street. A computer engineer aged 44 was killed while inside the butcher’s shop. The second casualty, named as Julien Vinson, 55, the owner of La Charrette, a cafe theatre, was stabbed in the street while trying to protect his 12-year-old son.  A third man, aged 63, was in a serious condition in hospital and four other people – two men, 65 and 59, and two women, 48 and 49 – were also injured. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, described the attack as “an odious act that has brought grief to a country already sorely tested in recent weeks”. The interior minister, Christophe Castaner, who travelled to Romans-sur-Isère after the attack, referred to the suspect’s “terrorist background”. He said: “I commend the full engagement of the security forces who quickly apprehended the suspect and who are now carrying out the investigation.” "
61,terror,"Yoga with Adriene is now a direct substitute for things I used to do outside: exercising, socialising, even therapy","Every day in isolation I wake up with stiffness in my body. Despite not having had a particularly active schedule before the Covid-19 pandemic, the effects of reducing my outside hours are showing up in my back, my legs and my hips. Those trips to work, to the supermarket and the cafe and the doctor, seem to have been the only thing standing between me and complete soft tissue atrophy. I’m sure the anxiety doesn’t help either. I wake sometimes in the early hours of the morning, all my muscles tense, from luridly disturbing dreams. I’m lucky I get to stay inside. I’ve lost half my income, but my experience of the roni is certainly in the bottom deciles of difficulty. I don’t work in the medical system or another essential industry. My partner and I can both work from home. We will probably come out of this experience without much permanent damage, unless you count a rapidly progressing addiction to the kimchi-flavoured instant ramen we now eat instead of takeaway.   Related: 'The people’s yogi': how Adriene Mishler became a YouTube phenomenon    This comforting message has reached my brain, but not my musculoskeletal system, which seems stubbornly committed to living out all the difficult emotions I am trying to keep under control. Very rude. It’s like brain-body whack-a-mole: every repressed burst of terror pops back up again in the form of a clicking hip ligament; every hour in the same position on the couch results in an hour of shoulder stiffness that interferes with my ability to calm down. There are no strict Cartesians during a global pandemic. I realised fairly early on that if I didn’t find a way to do some regular exercise indoors my sanity was going to disintegrate like a clump of precious toilet paper left in the rain. Judging by the many quarantine-related comments under her videos, me and about eight million other people have turned to Adriene Mishler’s YouTube yoga videos to stave off total systemic collapse. This makes sense: Mishler is known for her supportive, encouraging demeanour. Her videos are free. You don’t need any special clothes or equipment; I do them in my undies and a T-shirt, directly on the floor of my tiny living room. I tried to buy a yoga mat, but every store was sold out, which confirms I’m not the only person to have had this bright idea.              Importantly, there is something that feels tonally appropriate about yoga compared with other, boppier exercise videos. I mean, do I really want to do a 30-Minute Cardio Dance Workout Celebrities Love right now? Many of Mishler’s videos are oriented towards the management and relief of suffering: she has yoga videos for sadness, anxiety, stress, anger, and various kinds of injury and physical pain. Doing them takes me from a depressed couch potato who walks like the Tin Man to a moderately relaxed, functional human being. Despite these benefits, there is something more than a little concerning about how much Adriene has become a part of my life. Her videos are a direct substitute for things I used to do outside my flat: exercising, socialising, even going to therapy. The Yoga with Adriene community is a textbook example of parasociality – the kind of one-way relationship audiences have with celebrities, influencers, fictional characters and other figures who engage in one-to-many communication. These relationships aren’t necessarily bad: following a celeb on Instagram or wishing that Brad from Bon Appétit was your husband won’t immediately warp your brain.   Related: 'The dancefloor is a religious experience': the unselfconscious retro joy of the home dance workout    But they aren’t a good replacement for actual social contact, either. There is no give-and-take in a parasocial relationship, unless you count the mute pleading of thousands of comments under Adriene’s videos begging her to make a yoga routine that addresses their highly specific ailment. (“Dear Adriene, please make a yoga video for after you’ve had to give back your foster kitten and on the way home from doing that you hit a pothole and blow out your left rear tyre, and at the same time you have a cold and are getting divorced. Thank you so much.”) Staying inside the house 24/7 was already becoming not just the path of least resistance, but an actively facilitated lifestyle before the pandemic even hit. Now that there is a highly compelling reason to do so, there will be more and more infrastructure built or altered to support it: delivery everything, new and better ways to telecommute, telesocialise, receive telemedicine. You don’t have to be a JG Ballard fanatic to wonder where this might be heading. I don’t think we’ll all become hikkikomori tomorrow, but there’s no doubt that coronavirus is accelerating some already-underway behavioural shifts. Under ordinary circumstances, my simple need for physical activity could be satisfied in many ways. These days, it’s the soothing voice of Adriene telling me to move into downward dog on my next exhale, or nothing at all.  Eleanor Robertson is a Sydney-based writer "
62,terror,Faces of far-right terror: four cases of foiled plots,"Counter-terrorism officers say that since March 2017 seven far-right terror plots have been foiled. Here we take a look at some of these cases: 
Jack Renshaw 
Renshaw, a neo-Nazi, plotted to kill the Labour MP Rosie Cooper in summer 2017. He bought a 48cm (19in) “gladius” knife to kill the West Lancashire MP and a female police officer, DC Victoria Henderson, against whom he had a grudge. 
He discussed the murder plot in the Friar Penketh pub, Warrington, at a meeting attended by Christopher Lythgoe, the leader of the banned far-right group National Action, and others. 
But among them was Robbie Mullen, from Widnes, in Cheshire, an undercover operative for the charity Hope Not Hate. Through Hope Not Hate, he shared details of the plot with the police and the plot was foiled. Renshaw was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum term of 20 years.

Stables was a white supremacist who planned to carry out a machete attack at a gay pride event at a pub in Cumbria. 
Armed police swooped on Stables as he walked towards the New Empire pub in Barrow, Cumbria, on 23 June 2017. He was unarmed but police later found an axe and a machete at his home. 
Officers had received a tip-off from a member of a far-right Facebook group where Stables posted a message saying he was “going to war” and that he planned to “slaughter every single one of the gay bastards”. 
Stables was described by a judge as a risk to the public as he was sentenced to an indefinite hospital order at Leeds crown court on Wednesday.

63,terror,"Trump plan to label Mexico cartels as terror groups defies logic, experts say","Mexican drug cartel thugs have hanged bodies from bridges, set fire to crowded buildings and tossed hand grenades into crowds. 
But Donald Trump’s decision to designate the cartels as foreign terrorist organisations (FTOs) has been questioned by experts, who argue that the move’s main impact would be cosmetic – although it might provide a pretext for possible US military incursions. 
Tom Long, an international relations lecturer at the University of Warwick, argued that although organised crime groups often use terror tactics to impose control, they cannot be conflated with militants who seek political power. 
“Their primary motivation is not to achieve political change – it’s to make money,” said Long. “In order to make money, they corrupt and intimidate political actors and political institutions – but it’s a byproduct of their main objective.” 
Mexico has been convulsed by violence for more than a dozen years, sending the homicide rate soaring to record levels. 
Strategies to establish the rule of law have eluded three presidents since the then president, Felipe Calderón, declared war on drug cartels in December 2006. Attempts at decapitating the cartels by capturing or killing leaders – the so-called “kingpin strategy” – have only unleashed more violence as underlings fight over the spoils. 
 
  
  
   
    Calderón sends in the army
    
    Mexico’s “war on drugs” began in late 2006 when the president at the time, Felipe Calderón, ordered thousands of troops onto the streets in response to an explosion of horrific violence in his native state of Michoacán.
    Calderón hoped to smash the drug cartels with his heavily militarized onslaught but the approach was counter-productive and exacted a catastrophic human toll. As Mexico’s military went on the offensive, the body count sky-rocketed to new heights and tens of thousands were forced from their homes, disappeared or killed.
    
    Kingpin strategy
    
    Simultaneously Calderón also began pursuing the so-called&nbsp;“kingpin strategy”&nbsp;by which authorities sought to decapitate the cartels by targeting their leaders.
    That policy resulted in some high-profile scalps – notably Arturo Beltrán Leyva who was&nbsp;gunned down by Mexican marines in 2009&nbsp;– but also did little to bring peace. In fact, many believe such tactics served only to pulverize the world of organized crime, creating even more violence as new, less predictable factions squabbled for their piece of the pie.
    Under Calderón’s successor, Enrique Peña Nieto, the government’s rhetoric on crime softened as Mexico sought to shed its reputation as the headquarters of some the world’s most murderous mafia groups.
    But Calderón’s policies largely survived, with authorities targeting prominent cartel leaders such as Sinaloa’s Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.
    When “El Chapo” was arrested in early 2016, Mexico’s president bragged: “Mission accomplished”. But the violence went on. By the time Peña Nieto left office in 2018, Mexico had suffered another record year of murders, with nearly 36,000 people slain.
    
    ""Hugs not bullets""
    
    The leftwing populist Andrés Manuel López Obrador took power in December, promising a dramatic change in tactics. López Obrador, or Amlo as most call him, vowed to attack the social roots of crime,&nbsp;offering vocational training&nbsp;to more than 2.3 million disadvantaged young people at risk of being ensnared by the cartels.
    “It will be virtually impossible to achieve peace without justice and [social] welfare,” Amlo said, promising to slash the murder rate from an average of 89 killings per day with his “hugs not bullets” doctrine.
    Amlo also pledged to chair daily 6am security meetings and create a 60,000 strong ""National Guard"". But those measures have yet to pay off, with the new security force used mostly to hunt Central American migrants.
    Mexico now suffers an average of about 96 murders per day, with nearly 29,000 people killed since Amlo took office.
    
   
  
  
 
US attempts at offering assistance have also fallen short. 
But after the murder of nine women and children from an isolated Mormon community – all of whom were US citizens – calls for action have escalated, along with the specific demand that drug cartels be designated as terrorist organisations. 
After Trump said on Tuesday that he would “absolutely” go ahead with the designation, Mexico’s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, tweeted: “Mexico will not accept any action that signifies a violation of its national sovereignty. We will act firmly … Mutual respect is the base of cooperation.”

The massacre attracted enormous attention to the binational Mormon communities living in a remote corner of the country, and members of the group were outspoken in their calls for Trump to designate the cartels as terrorist organisations. 
“If someone is murdering your family, anybody would accept help from wherever they can get it,” Julian LeBarón, an anticrime activist and relative of some of the victims, told the Guardian. “Once it comes down to life and death, I think the moral thing is to choose life.” 
There is no doubt that Mexico is in crisis – and that President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s “hugs not bullets” policy has failed to rein in the violence. Over three disastrous weeks in October and November, gunmen from various crime factions massacred 13 policemen, slaughtered the Mormons and besieged an entire city to free the son of the Sinaloa cartel boss Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. 
But analysts who study Mexican security express skepticism that the terrorism designation would do much good. 
The move makes it illegal to provide material support to designated groups – such as Colombia rebel armies, said Brian Phillips, a terrorism expert at the University of Essex. 
“But that doesn’t make sense for criminal groups, because they’re already seen as illegitimate groups,” he said. “It’s already illegal to buy cocaine from the Sinaloa cartel.” 
The kingpin strategy has caused the repeated and violent restructuring of Mexico’s criminal underground. Groups fracture and reform at a dizzying rate, re-establishing territorial control through violence and alliances – a scenario in which any individual terrorism designation would be ineffective and hard to apply.

“Organised crime in Mexico is already tremendously fragmented and disparate, so it’s not clear that tools aimed at hierarchical organizations are going to be effective,” Long said. 
Trump’s comments reprise a familiar practice of pummelling Mexico for political purposes: the president launched his 2016 election campaign by describing Mexicans as rapists and robbers and once threatened to send US troops over the border to stop “bad hombres”. 
But one unintended consequence of the designation could come at that same frontier, where it could bolster the cases of asylum seekers fleeing cartel violence. 
US judges routinely reject asylum claims from those fleeing crime, however violent, but they have traditionally been more sympathetic to people fleeing terrorism, said Adam Isacson, an analyst with the Washington Office on Latin America. 
“It reinforces the argument that the group threatening you has national reach – and that the government was less likely to be able to protect you,” Isacson said, adding Trump’s move might end up undermining his own efforts to undercut the US asylum system."
64,terror,Neo-Nazi terror group threatened ‘to find and harm’ US activist in Germany,"An US activist in Germany who was targeted by the neo-Nazi terror group Atomwaffen Division (AWD) has told the Guardian German police were last year warned by US authorities of “a specific threat to find me and do me harm”.   Related: House investigating whether Trump lied to Robert Mueller – live    The activist, who moved to Germany in part because of the threats she was receiving from the far right in the US, was told last November that German Federal Criminal Police had been warned by US federal authorities about an AWD member who had traveled to Germany with the possible intention of harming her. She was also advised to take security precautions, including delisting her address from official government records, and to exercise vigilance when walking at night. The activist, whose name is being withheld due to safety concerns, has been a consistent and vocal critic of the far right, and has participated in prominent anti-fascist demonstrations. She showed the Guardian Twitter direct messages sent by German police last November, asking her to call them about the threat. German magazine Der Spiegel, who first reported on the transnational warning, confirmed the activist’s account with German authorities. The activist believes the person who triggered international concerns was allowed to enter the country. At the time, the activist says, German police told her “they knew who he was, they knew who he was meeting with, and they knew who was behind the threats, but they didn’t know where they were”. Last week, however, a suspected American member of AWD was denied entry to Germany. The activist said she had decided to go public about the incident because of the “assassinations and death threats” carried out by extremist groups in Germany in recent months, and the apparent expansion of the accelerationist neo-Nazi group’s operations to Germany. On 27 October, German Green politicians Cem Özdemir and Claudia Roth received email death threats signed by “Atomwaffen Division Deutschland”. In the threats, the groups claimed to have a list of people marked for assassination. The German expansion of the group have reportedly flyered German universities, and posted propaganda to homes in a Turkish neighborhood. In June, a far-right extremist confessed to the assassination of pro-refugee Christian Democrat politician, Walter Lübcke. Also in June, German neo-Nazi “doomsday prepper” group Nordkreuz were found to have assembled a “kill list” of politicians which the group saw as pro-refugee. In October, a far-right antisemite attacked a synagogue in the city of Halle, armed with homemade firearms and explosives. AWD has been linked to at least five murders in the US. Several members are currently facing charges ranging from weapons offenses to alleged bomb plots. US AWD members have been banned from traveling to countries including Canada and Germany. AWD began in the United States, as an outgrowth of the neo-Nazi subculture incubated on the Iron March forum. Earlier this month, when Iron March’s entire archive was leaked by anonymous activists, it was revealed that the website had been the glue for an international network of extremists. Members of the group embraces a philosophy of “accelerationism”, which seeks to use violence to “hasten the collapse of society as we know it”, according to the Anti-Defamation League. The same perspective was embraced in the manifesto of the man charged with the murder of 51 people in Christchurch last March. The activist who was the subject of threats from the group urged US authorities to “start treating this as international terrorism, which it is”."
65,terror,"Man's 'experiments' with explosives were lawful, court rules","﻿A man who manufactured high explosives at home and triggered blasts remotely has been cleared of the most serious charges by the supreme court after pleading that it was for his “personal experimentation” and “private education”. The narrow 3-2 majority by judges on the UK’s highest court sets a significant precedent that may surprise counter-terrorism police who regularly investigate homegrown bomb plots. Chez Copeland, 22, who has been diagnosed with autism and lives in Coventry with his mother, has already spent 22 months on remand in prison. He was released last week after pleading guilty at Birmingham crown court to separate charges of owning a stun gun and acquiring an explosive without a certificate. Copeland had been arrested in April 2018 after purchasing chemicals online. He claimed that he had developed an obsessive interest in bomb disposal skills after watching the film The Hurt Locker. The movie follows a US bomb disposal team in Iraq. Copeland told officers he wanted to understand how explosives worked and to experiment with them. The supreme court case focused on a specific clause, section 4 (1), in the 1883 Explosive Substances Act, which says that anyone who makes or has in their possession explosive substances is liable to prosecution unless they can show that it was “for a lawful object”. The maximum sentence is life imprisonment. The court had to consider whether “for the purposes of section 4(1) can personal experimentation or own private education, absent some ulterior unlawful purpose, be regarded as a lawful object?” Copeland, the judgment said, purchased chemicals online, made explosives and detonated them remotely in his back garden by means of a mobile phone signal. He had also manufactured Hexamethylene Triperoxide Diamine (HMTD) which is a “sensitive primary high explosive that can easily be detonated”. HMTD was discovered in “the form of a powdery substance in a petri dish” in the garden shed and in his bedroom. Other material included manuals for making explosives found on his computer. Delivering their majority judgment, three supreme court justices, Lord Reed, the court president, Lord Carnwath and Lord Sales, said that for his defence, Copeland “only had to establish that he proposed using the HMTD in his possession for the lawful objects of experimentation and self-education”. They added: “The term ‘lawful object’ … does not require specification of the precise way in which the substance in question will be used by the accused. “[His] proposed defence was that he intended to use the HMTD in small amounts to produce insignificant detonations of the order to be expected from a simple domestic firework, ie at a level which was lawful. “It was possible that he could have achieved this, or that he genuinely believed that he could, as he had done using other explosive substances on previous occasions. Therefore his defence … should have been allowed to be presented at trial, rather than being ruled out at the preliminary hearing.” But two other judges on the panel, Lord Lloyd-Jones and Lord Hamblen, gave a dissenting judgment. They declared that “to say that something is done for one’s own private education is not a sufficient object for the purposes of the section 4(1) defence, as it does not identify the use to which the explosives will be put in order to provide such education. “Similarly, personal experimentation is not a sufficient object for this purpose as, although it identifies in very general terms what is to be done with the explosives, it does not identify any purpose for so doing.” The Explosive Substances Act was quickly passed by parliament in 1883 in response to fears of Irish nationalist bomb attacks and because previous offences were thought to provide insufficient protection for the public. At the hearing in Birmingham last week, Copeland’s barrister, Paul Bogan QC, said the blasts posed “no real risk of injury” and described the explosions as being similar to “a damp firework”. After the terrorism offences against Copeland were dropped – because the crown court had been given advance notice of the supreme court ruling – his mother, Kim, said: “They didn’t have to create the circus that they have created and treat us like criminals.”"
66,terror,The Guardian view on Boris Johnson’s fact-free claims: dodging responsibility on terror attack,"Boris Johnson took his disinformation campaign to the BBC on Sunday with a blizzard of bluster, obfuscation and lies designed to blunt any interrogation. He lowered the bar for political debate by cynically exploiting the terrorist attack on Friday to peddle a plan for draconian sentences, against the wishes of a dead victim’s family; then by bizarrely blaming the opposition parties for the release of a terrorist (he was let out because of the sentence imposed by the court of appeal); and last by attempting to smear Jeremy Corbyn with a conspiracy theory about him wanting to disband MI5. Mr Johnson, because he is prime minister, has better access to the details of the case of Usman Khan, a terrorist who murdered innocent people in London last week, than almost anyone else. He knows where he was detained, and what restrictions there were on his movements. He would know what the police and counter-terrorism officers were doing to monitor Khan. But Mr Johnson’s eye is not on the facts to inform the public. Mr Johnson does not care a jot about whether what he says describes reality. This is why he makes facts up. The act is a sinister distraction. Mr Johnson is attempting to distance himself from his party’s grinding destruction of the justice system in England and Wales after nine years of austerity and outsourcing. Only last year the chief inspector of prisons said that present conditions in jails have “no place in an advanced nation”. The Khan case threatens to illuminate how the Tory policies have made sure prison does not work, with deadly consequences for the general public. This ought to be a matter of some disquiet as there are people in custody in Britain for terrorism offences who regard prisons as “universities of terror” from which to graduate. It is not as if this problem is new. Prisons have played an instrumental role in many radical political groups including Irish republicans, German Marxists and jihadists. This history might have informed Conservative policy over the last decade so that the management of terror offenders mitigated the risks of prison radicalisation. However, the opposite appears to have happened. During Khan’s time behind bars, the prison and probation services saw budget cuts of about 40%. Khan was in a prison service where assaults on staff and prisoners are rising. It is no surprise that prisoner violence and self-harm have become more prevalent, given that there are 2,300 fewer prison officers than in 2010 – and 378 fewer in high-security jails. With a prison system in crisis, is it any surprise that there was little capacity to deal with jihadi sympathisers among the inmates? High-security prisons were warned that extremists were able to have an “adverse influence” on fellow prisoners. The response by the then justice secretary, Michael Gove, was to have a system of “jails within jails” to prevent extremists from radicalising vulnerable prisoners. Yet this was judged to have been a failure – a verdict that should also be applied to the government’s deradicalisation programmes. Last year the Guardian revealed the country faced a surge in the number of convicted terrorists released from prison. This when the probation service was brought to its knees by a disastrous ideologically driven attempt to manage the rehabilitation of low-and medium-risk offenders for shareholder profit. Khan, as a dangerous extremist, was overseen by the state arm of the probation service – where officers are stretched to breaking point, with workloads of up to 160% of their capacity. There have been seven Tory justice secretaries, but none has understood that their misguided policies have rent apart this country – or that austerity has bred the isolating conditions that have produced violent jihadists. About 80% of would-be terrorists are home-grown. As Neil Basu, Britain’s most senior counter-terrorism officer, noted, what the country would benefit from are “policies that go towards more social inclusion, more social mobility and more education [that] are much more likely to drive down violence … than all the policing and state security apparatus put together”. These are wise words, but unfortunately for the country Mr Johnson won’t listen to them: he’s gone fully fact-free to win this election."
67,terror,Counter-terror chief says policing alone cannot beat extremism,"Britain’s most senior counter-terrorism officer has said the police and security services are no longer enough to win the fight against violent extremism, and the UK must instead improve community cohesion, social mobility and education. In his first major interview since taking up his post last year, the Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Neil Basu told the Guardian that up to 80% of those who wanted to attack the UK were British-born or raised, which strongly indicated domestic social issues were among the root causes. Grievances held by people who were “malleable” to terrorist recruitment were highly dangerous, he said, calling for sociologists and criminologists to take a leading role in helping police tackle the problem. Basu, who is highly regarded in Whitehall, is seen as a potential next head of the Met. His comments are a significant break in tone, if not strategy, about how to combat terrorism and prevent it from becoming a multigenerational struggle that damages the UK’s social fabric.   Related: Counter-terror chief Basu speaks truth to power on social inclusion | Letters    Basu said Prevent, which he sees as the most important plank of Britain’s counter-terrorism strategy, had been “badly handled”, but its work was vital and had to become more transparent and community led. He also said extreme rightwing terrorism was rising, with an increase in nationalism since the Brexit vote potentially fuelling violence. Giving a personal view on the best ways to reduce terrorism, Basu said: “Policies that go towards more social inclusion, more social mobility and more education are much more likely to drive down violence … than all the policing and state security apparatus put together. It is much more likely to have a positive effect on society. “The prescription for me is around social inclusion – it’s social mobility, it’s education, it’s opportunity.” Basu said counter-terrorism operations increased by 50% from 2015 to 2017 and have since remained at a high level. The terror threat is still severe despite Isis losing territory in Iraq and Syria. Both Islamist and extreme rightwing terrorists have continued to recruit Britons, despite efforts to thwart them. “Nothing I am saying remotely excuses these heinous acts of criminal violence,” Basu said. “But the deeper causes need examining. My teams are world class at stopping attacks and locking terrorists up. But we need to stop the flow of recruits into terrorism. “Don’t forget that 70%-80% of the people we arrest, disrupt or commit an attack here, are born and raised here. Born or at least raised here. That has got to tell us something about our society – that we have got to look at why they would be prepared to do that. “I want good academics, good sociologists, good criminologists … to be telling us exactly why that is.” Basu accepted many people went through negative experiences without ever dreaming of committing violence, and some terrorists came from middle-class backgrounds and seemingly wanted for nothing. But he said some people were more “malleable” than others to terrorist recruitment and there were common themes. “It might be everything from high anxiety, to lack of confidence, lack of education, things that may have happened to them when they are young, bullying, racism, bigotry, lack of opportunity, early experiences with law enforcement even, domestic violence,” he said. The counter-terrorism network Basu heads had been stretched by the high volume of terrorist activity from Islamists. On top of this and rightwing extremism, he said there was a growing threat from states such as Russia, following the Salisbury novichok poisonings.     Forensics officers remove the bench where the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter were found in Salisbury. Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA    Basu said there was no one path that led to terrorism and a list of factors could result in violence if not checked at some point. “All of those things will be as relevant to a terrorist cause as they will be to other people of violence in other crime types,” he said. Policies were up to the government, he said, but they must tackle “education, access to health, not disproportionate outcomes in criminal justice, feeling like you’ve got an opportunity to get on in life”. Basu added: “These are wider societal problems. They are not paying more police and more security services to stop more terrorist attacks. That’s not the cure for this. Like every other aspect of law enforcement, we [counter-terrorism policing] are a suppression tool for a problem. We are dealing with the symptom and we do need to deal with the root causes of it.” While the majority of the terrorism threat was from Islamist extremists, far-right propaganda could help create a permissive environment for some to commit violence, he said, and society needed to determine how much of that rhetoric was acceptable. “At the moment, we seem to be accepting a level which I think is potentially breeding some intolerance,” he said. “That intolerance, for a small number of people, can spin up very quickly to a violent act, and we have some examples of that. We have some very awful examples of that.” He said that despite its importance, Prevent had been the least successful part of the UK’s counter-terrorism strategy so far, compared with the other three strands – Pursue, Protect and Prepare – which were all “outstanding”. Prevent, which critics have called a “toxic brand” , needed “better communication, more transparency [and] an ability not to create a vacuum for people to attack it, by not actually trying to defend it”. Asked whether Prevent, in its early years, when headed by a former senior intelligence officer, had come across as turning a community into a security issue, Basu said: “Not when it started. It morphed into that. It started off as a safeguarding, vulnerability programme. It was, in my view, badly handled. “This won’t be won by government or by people like me. It will be won by people who walk into community halls up and down the country and explain.” Basu rejected notions that British Muslims should “assimilate” and defended the rights of religious conservatives of all faiths, saying: “Assimilation implies that I have to hide myself in order to get on. We should not be a society that accepts that. He added: “You should be able to practise your religion without suffering some condemnation of that; so my view is, do no harm. And that does not matter whether you are conservative Islamic, conservative Christian, conservative Hindu, conservative Sikh. You should be able to practise your culture or religion openly and still be accepting of others, and others be accepting of you. That is a socially inclusive society.”"
68,terror,Revealed: how the FBI targeted environmental activists in domestic terror investigations,"Helen Yost, a 62-year-old environmental educator, has been a committed activist for nearly a decade. She says she spends 60 to 80 hours a week as a community organizer for Wild Idaho Rising Tide. She’s been arrested twice for engaging in non-violent civil disobedience. Yost may not fit the profile of a domestic terrorist, but in 2014 the FBI classified her as a potential threat to national security. According to hundreds of pages of FBI files obtained by the Guardian through a Freedom of Information Act (Foia) lawsuit, and interviews with activists, Yost and more than a dozen other people campaigning against fossil fuel extraction in North America have been identified in domestic terrorism-related investigations. The investigations, which targeted individual activists and some environmental organizations, were opened in 2013-2014, at the height of opposition to the Keystone XL Pipeline and the expansion of fossil fuel production in North America.     From an FBI communication on Helen Yost, dated 24 July 2014. Photograph: FBI    The new Foia documents reveal the bureau’s motivation for investigating a broad cross-section of the environmental movement and its characterization of non-violent protesters as a potential threat to national security. In 2010, the DoJ’s inspector general criticized the FBI for using non-violent civil disobedience as grounds to open domestic terrorism investigations. US citizens swept up in such investigations can be placed on terrorism watchlists and subjected to surveillance and restrictions on international travel. The designation can also lead local law enforcement to take a more confrontational approach when engaging with non-violent activists. The FBI’s 2013-2014 investigation of Keystone XL activists in Houston violated internal agency guidelines designed to prevent the bureau from infringing on constitutionally protected activities. The investigations opened in 2013-2014 were closed after the FBI concluded that the individuals and organizations had not engaged in criminal activity and did not a pose a threat to national security. In 2015, the Obama administration rejected the Keystone XL pipeline project, which required state department approval because it would cross international borders, handing the environmental movement a major victory. More large-scale protests followed, including the standoff over the Dakota Access pipeline, which temporarily delayed the project. But those decisions have been reversed in recent years. Donald Trump has approved construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, and his administration has also advocated for stiffer penalties against activists who engage in non-violent direct action targeting fossil fuel infrastructure. Meanwhile, in the wake of the Standing Rock protests, seven states have passed legislation making it a crime to trespass on property containing critical infrastructure. In its July 2014 file on Yost, the FBI cited federal anti-terrorism legislation prohibiting “attacks and other violence against railroad carriers” as the primary justification for opening the investigation. Violation of the law can lead to up to 20 years in prison. Activists who engage in non-violent civil disobedience and are charged with minor offenses such as trespassing are typically released within 48 hours. The FBI characterized Yost as being driven by a “desire to stop fossil fuels which, in her political view, are destroying parts of the US, specifically Montana, Idaho and Washington”. In addition, the FBI discussed the case with the US attorney’s office in Idaho, local law enforcement, and BNSF Railway, which operates the main rail line delivering coal and oil to export terminals in the Pacific north-west.     From an FBI communication on Helen Yost, dated 24 July 2014. Photograph: FBI communication on Helen Yost    According to the FBI file, the bureau opened the investigation based on information that Yost “was organizing and planning on conducting illegal activities against railroad companies from Montana into Idaho and Washington”. Yost said Wild Idaho Rising Tide (WIRT) never organized direct action protests to disrupt oil train traffic passing in the region. The heavily redacted Yost investigation concludes that “no potential criminal violations or priority threats to national security warranting further investigation were identified”. WIRT did participate in a series of community-led events and workshops in July and August 2014 opposing the transport of oil and coal by rail. “Investigators may have conflated several community events to assume such fictitious allegations,” Yost said in an email. For several years, WIRT, founded in 2011, had been publicizing its actions on the organization’s Facebook page. Much of its activity had focused on stopping the passage of huge trucks known as megaloads, which transport processing equipment to tar sands oil fields in Canada and weigh hundreds of thousands of pounds, along one of Idaho’s scenic byways. The campaign involved posting public records on the megaload routes, tracking their progress, and at times blockading their movement. Yost was also active in protesting against the shipment of coal and oil by rail to export terminals in Seattle. In the summer of 2014, WIRT, along with several other environmental organizations and native groups across the Pacific north-west, sponsored a series of rallies and workshops in the region. Those protests were peaceful – a handful of activists in Montana including the environmental writer Rick Bass were arrested for trespassing – and in the end the FBI concluded that Yost did not pose a threat to national security. Several months later the investigation was closed. However, in the file closing the case, it appears that Yost has been watchlisted, which is standard for named subjects of FBI domestic terrorism investigations, according to Mike German, a former FBI agent who is now a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice. Being watchlisted can lead to heightened scrutiny from law enforcement and delays or additional screenings when traveling. Yost said she had not traveled overseas since the FBI investigation. Yost, who was contacted by an FBI agent when the case was still active, said she was not surprised by the agency’s actions. Surveillance was a form of suppression, she said, and this was another attempt to criminalize the actions of “normal people” working to protect natural resources. But she remains undeterred. “Assume they know the color of your underwear every morning and get up and resist anyway,” Yost said. Herb Goodwin, a 70-year-old activist, has a similar philosophy. “We’re all under surveillance,” Goodwin said. “If they want to look at your stuff, they’re going to.” In 2013-2014 Goodwin frequently participated in actions organized by Yost and WIRT. He was also part of the Occupy Wall Street protests in Bellingham, Washington, in 2011 and was one of 12 individuals arrested that year for blockading a BNSF coal train passing through the city. They became known as the Bellingham 12. Goodwin was one of at least a dozen environmental activists, many of them affiliated with the group Deep Green Resistance, contacted by FBI agents in autumn 2014. In early October that year, not long after Goodwin returned from a megaload resistance campaign in Idaho, an FBI agent and a police intelligence officer showed up at his residence. According to Goodwin, they wanted to ask him questions about the environmental group Deep Green Resistance. Goodwin refused to cooperate and referred the agents to his lawyer, who himself became a subject of interest to the FBI. Founded in 2011 Deep Green Resistance (DGR), based on the principles laid out in the book of the same name, describes itself as a radical organization that “uses direct action in the fight to save the planet”. Though the group supports underground movements, its members abide by a code of conduct that includes a commitment to nonviolence and operating entirely above-ground. According to the group’s website, “We do not want to be involved in or aware of any underground organizing.” In another FBI interview with a DGR member documented in the files, the activist even invited the agents to attend one of DGR’s presentations. FBI files show that the bureau initiated the two-year investigation into DGR to determine if the group or any of its members were planning to engage in the destruction of energy facilities or attacks against railroad companies, referring to the same federal statute cited in the Yost investigation. But the FBI also took an interest in constitutionally protected activities, including DGR members’ participation in public meetings and lectures and the group’s early organizing efforts. Even though the FBI investigation found no evidence that DGR was planning to engage in violent activity, it often portrayed the group as an extremist organization. One individual contacted numerous times by the FBI was said to have been a “suspected member of the Deep Green Resistance’s extremist wing” and a participant in DGR’s “Midwest extremist planning process”. DGR did have a strategic planning conference in Wisconsin in spring 2012 which they said was attended by about 30 people, but it was publicly advertised and focused on building the organization, fundraising and leadership training.     From an FBI communication on Deep Green Resistance, dated 28 November 2014. Photograph: FBI communication    The FBI also focused its attention on DGR organizing at Western Washington University, which hosted a lecture in 2011 by two of the group’s members, Max Wilbert and Dillon Thomson. Information about the lecture, titled Environmentalism for the New Century, and about the professor who hosted it was included in the FBI files. Wilbert, who attended WWU, is also a member of DGR’s board of directors. As part of the investigation, the FBI met with the university’s police department to “discuss possible Deep Green Resistance presence on the WWU campus”. The FBI also said it would attempt to determine whether any of the professors in the environmental sciences department were involved in the “DGR movement”.     From an FBI communication on Deep Green Resistance, dated 21 November 2013. Photograph: FBI communication    The sweeping investigation into DGR’s activities was formally closed in 2014 but Wilbert assumes that the group is still being closely watched. Wilbert, who is also a writer and photographer, frequently posts short polemical essays on his Facebook page or the Deep Green Resistance website. Wilbert said that on 7 September 2018, nearly four years after the investigation was closed, he got a call from an FBI agent in Seattle informing him that the bureau had received an anonymous tip regarding something he had written online. The agent also left a card at Wilbert’s parents’ home. “I’m pretty outspoken about being a revolutionary, somebody who believes in the necessity for revolutionary change,” Wilbert said. “It’s not something I hide.” An FBI file documenting the online tip describes Wilbert as “an environmental extremist” involved in “inciting violence in Seattle”. German, the former FBI agent, whose recent book, Disrupt, Discredit, and Divide, chronicles the troubling post-9/11 expansion of the FBI’s domestic surveillance powers, said the agency had failed to heed the warnings laid out in a 2010 justice department IG investigation that criticized the FBI’s targeting of certain domestic advocacy groups. According to German, the Yost files and the two-year DGR investigation show how “ineffective these internal oversight mechanisms are to preventing abusive and wasteful investigations of non-violent protesters”.

69,terror,Terrorism police list Extinction Rebellion as extremist ideology,"Counter-terrorism police placed the non-violent group Extinction Rebellion (XR) on a list of extremist ideologies that should be reported to the authorities running the Prevent programme, which aims to catch those at risk of committing  atrocities, the Guardian has learned. The climate emergency campaign group was included in a 12-page guide produced by counter-terrorism police in the south-east titled Safeguarding young people and adults from ideological extremism, which is marked as “official”. XR featured alongside threats to national security such as neo-Nazi terrorism and a pro-terrorist Islamist group. The guide, aimed at police officers, government organisations and teachers who by law have to report concerns about radicalisation, was dated last November.       It says that issues to look out for include people who speak in “strong or emotive terms about environmental issues like climate change, ecology, species extinction, fracking, airport expansion or pollution”. In the guide, people are advised to listen and look out for young people who “neglect to attend school” or “participate in planned school walkouts” – an allusion to the school strikes for the climate, a global movement of which the activist Greta Thunberg is a lead proponent. Thousands of UK pupils, and millions worldwide, walked out of school last year in protest at government inaction on the climate crisis. The document also flags young people taking part in non-violent direct action, such as sit-down protests, banner drops or “writing environmentally themed graffiti”. The disclosure that XR has been listed alongside proscribed groups such as National Action and Al-Muhajiroun is likely to be deeply embarrassing for counter-terror chiefs. They have for years faced claims that Prevent can cross the line to stifle legitimate free speech, thought and dissent.      When the Guardian first asked police about the document, officials said they would review the guidance to clarify their position on Extinction Rebellion. But following further questions, counter-terrorism police confirmed it had been circulated to “statutory partners” and had now been recalled. They said they now accepted that the protest group was not extremist.  The guide, bearing the counter-terrorism policing logo, urges those in “regular, direct contact with young people or members of the public” to look out for various warning signs and consider a referral to Prevent if they believe someone is falling prey to “ideological extremism”.  Setting out its purpose, the guide says: “This document is designed to help you recognise when young people or adults may be vulnerable to extreme or violent ideologies. “Identification of any one of the signs presented here, in isolation, may not be indicative of vulnerability or radicalisation. However, in combination or in circumstances where they do not ‘fit’, they may indicate an individual at risk. In such cases, consider whether the individual is vulnerable to extremism and should be referred to the UK government’s Prevent programme.” The guide runs through various extremist ideologies, and contains a whole page on XR. Explaining why it is considered a threat, it states: “Anti-establishment philosophy that seeks system change underlies its activism; the group attracts to its events school-age children and adults unlikely to be aware of this. While non-violent against persons, the campaign encourages other law-breaking activities.” It adds: “While concern about climate change is not in itself extreme, activists may encourage vulnerable people to perform acts of violence, or commit such acts themselves.”  The Guardian understands that counter-terrorism officials at a national level believe including XR in the guide was a mistake and insist they do not view its ideology as extremist. They say any such advice was issued by Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE) in the south-east of England and not in any other part of the UK. In its first statement, CTPSE said: “This document was produced at a local level to help our partners to spot the signs of vulnerability to radicalisation. By including Extinction Rebellion in this document, it gives the impression we consider them to be an extremist group, which they are not. We will review the guidance to make this clear.” Later, after further inquiries from the Guardian, police said they would recall the document. DCS Kath Barnes, head of CTPSE, said: “I would like to make it quite clear that we do not classify Extinction Rebellion as an extremist organisation. The inclusion of Extinction Rebellion in this document was an error of judgment and we will now be reviewing all of the contents as a result. “It was produced by CTPSE to assist our statutory partners – including police forces and government organisations – in identifying people who may be vulnerable as a result of their links to some organisations. “The document was designed for a very specific audience who understand the complexities of the safeguarding environment we work within and who have statutory duties under Prevent. We are in the process of confirming who it has been shared with and recalling it. “We as Counter Terrorism Policing, along with our partners, have a responsibility to protect vulnerable people. Officers are trained to spot those who may be vulnerable, and the membership of an organisation that supports environmental or animal welfare issues alone would not be a trigger.”       Extinction Rebellion is a global environmental movement with the stated aim of using nonviolent civil disobedience “in an attempt to halt mass extinction and minimise the risk of social collapse”. The group has won the backing of a range of MPs and celebrities. A spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion said: “How dare they? Children up and down the country are desperately fighting for a future. Teachers, grandparents, nurses have been trying their best with loving nonviolence to get politicians and big business to do something about the dire state of our planet. And this is how the establishment responds. “In a world of misinformation, where lies travel faster than the truth, we can’t help but wonder was this a deliberate attempt to silence a legitimate cause. Wouldn’t it be nice if they focused on the real extremists, the fossil fuel companies and those that do their bidding?” In an online response to what the group called the “terrorism slur”, it also included objections from former police officers. Paul Stephens, a former detective sergeant with the Metropolitan police, said: “When are the police going to wake up? The climate and ecological emergency is the most serious threat to public safety in history and the longer this government fails to address it and continues to invest in fossil fuels, the greater the problem will be for the police. Who hasn’t criticised our system of government in recent years? Are we all extremists?”   Related: Greta Thunberg tells world leaders to end fossil fuel ‘madness’    The document from the CTPSE lists among ideologies to look out for that of the extreme right National Action, warning that followers idolise Adolf Hitler; and Al-Muhajiroun, which pledged allegiance to Islamic State and whose followers have carried out murders on Britain’s streets.  Those behind Prevent argue it is an important part of the fight against violent extremism, some say the most important, seeking to identify and divert people before they carry out violent attacks. In its early years it focussed mainly on Muslims and faced claims of impinging on freedom of speech and thought. It has recently been beset by problems. The government set up a review of Prevent hoping it would help restore confidence but its chair, Lord Carlile, stepped down amid claims of bias and a replacement is yet to be appointed. Some senior policing figures believe Prevent needs to be more community focussed. In August Neil Basu, the head of counter-terrorism, accepted mistakes had been made with Prevent as he stressed its continued importance: “It started off as a safeguarding, vulnerability programme. It was, in my view, badly handled.” In September, the Guardian revealed a retired doctor who joined XR and took part in non-violent environmental protests was reported to Prevent by his NHS trust. Police say XR’s protests have cost tens of millions of pounds, diverted officers from crime fighting and caused disruption to the public. The group recently won a case against the police in the courts when a ban on protests in London was ruled unlawful."
70,terror,Counter-terrorism police investigate attack on prison officers,"Counter-terrorism police are investigating an attack by two inmates at a maximum-security jail that resulted in five prison officers being taken to hospital. The two prisoners involved at the incident at HMP Whitemoor near March in Cambridgeshire were wearing fake suicide vests and brandishing improvised bladed weapons, according to reports. One of the alleged perpetrators of the incident, which took place on Thursday morning as cells were unlocked, is serving a sentence for a terrorism offence while the other had been jailed for a violent offence, the BBC reported. One officer, thought to be the initial target, was stabbed and slashed, the others had rushed to help. The officers’ injuries are not believed to be life-threatening. The Metropolitan police said their counter-terrorism command unit had been called in to the maximum security prison “due to certain circumstances relating to this incident”. No arrests had been made so far, the force said. A Prison Service spokesman said the incident was “quickly resolved by brave staff – and our thoughts are with the injured officers at this time”. He did not state the nature of the officers’ injuries. The statement added: “We do not tolerate assaults on our hard-working officers and will push for the strongest possible punishment. “We have referred the incident to the police and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.” HMP Whitemoor is a 458-capacity maximum security prison housing more than 400 Category A and B prisoners on three wings, including a number of the highest-risk inmates. In a statement, the Met said: “Due to certain circumstances relating to this incident, it was deemed appropriate for the investigation to be carried out by officers from the Met police counter-terrorism command. “However, we must stress that at this early stage of the investigation we are keeping an open mind with regards to any motives, and inquiries to establish the full circumstances of the incident are ongoing.” In February 2019, a small number of prison staff received medical treatment after violence broke out at the prison. Usman Khan, who carried out a terrorist attack in London Bridge on 29 November before being shot dead by police, had previously served a sentence at HMP Whitemoor. In 2015, it emerged that an inmate at Whitemoor was kept in segregation for two and a half years. The Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) for HMP Whitemoor also revealed that it held seven of the 24 prisoners detained in segregation for more than six months across England’s high-security jails. Inspectors said a staffing “merry-go-round” meant staff at the segregation unit had been inexperienced and their management had been “poor”. Prison rules enable a governor to arrange for a prisoner to be segregated – kept away from other inmates – for up to 72 hours, before seeking authorisation from the secretary of state. Inmates can be segregated if they are deemed to be in danger, if they are deemed dangerous to other prisoners, or as punishment for disruptive behaviour."

Top stories The NSW government is advising local councils to invoke terrorism fears to keep the location of potentially lethal flammable cladding secret from the public. A taskforce has spent two years auditing 185,000 building records to understand how widespread the cladding is. Guardian Australia has obtained an internal missive sent by the NSW government to local councils last month warning them the cladding information is “highly sensitive” and advising them the release of the documents may be contrary to the public interest. Councils were given examples of three common reasons to reject requests: the potential to affect property prices; to derail the taskforce’s work; and to create a risk of “terror” and arson. Environmental and civil society groups have warned the government that nuclear power has “no role” in Australia. As submissions to the parliamentary inquiry on nuclear power close, a diverse collection of unions, churches, health, environmental and Indigenous groups has called on the government to rule out changing the law to allow nuclear energy in Australia. The group warned nuclear power was “a dangerous distraction from real movement on the pressing energy decisions and climate actions we need”.

But the survey, from the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, also shows that when chief executives do speak out they are regarded as doing so out of self-interest. The survey of 3,000 Australians and 59 bosses showed 78% of the general public supported corporate leaders speaking out on issues of public importance but 52% thought that when they were did they were talking in the interests of their own company.

72,terror,Man arrested after London mosque stabbing,"Scotland Yard has launched an investigation into the attempted murder of a man who was stabbed at a mosque during afternoon prayers before his alleged attacker was wrestled to the ground by worshippers. 
The mosque’s muazzin, who calls others to prayer, was stabbed in the neck in front of hundreds of horrified onlookers at London Central Mosque in Regent’s Park, in what one witness described as “30 seconds of mayhem”. 
Online footage showed the alleged perpetrator, a 29-year-old man, being pinned to the ground by police. While one witness claimed that he was a regular at the mosque, another said that he had never seen him before. 
The Metropolitan police, who arrested the alleged attacker on suspicion of attempted murder, said they were not treating the incident as terror-related. 
The victim, named locally as Raafat Maglad and said to be around 70 years old, has attended the mosque for 25 years. He was rushed to hospital after being treated by paramedics at the scene. He was “seriously injured”, the mosque said, but his condition was not life-threatening. 
A Twitter user posted footage of a man wearing jeans and a red top, sitting cross-legged in the mosque, apparently being held in cuffs behind his back by a police officer. The user said the victim had been taken to hospital after being “stabbed in the neck” during prayers.

In a statement, the Met said: “A 29-year-old man, who is believed to have been attending prayers, was arrested inside the mosque on suspicion of attempted murder. He has been taken into custody at a central London police station. The incident is not being treated as terror-related at this time.” 
One witness said the suspect had been seen at the mosque several times in recent months. 
Abi Watik, 59, said: “We were shocked. We didn’t know what was happening.” He said the victim had been stabbed once in the right shoulder moments after prayers had started, and he believed the suspect had waited for that moment. 
“It had just started and he was waiting for them to start. He was praying behind him and then he stabbed him. He [the suspect] was silent the whole time.”

Ayaz Ahmad, an adviser to the mosque, was doing the Asr afternoon prayer when the victim, who was standing behind the imam, was attacked. “It was during the first rakat of the prayer,” Ahmad said. “We all tussled with him [the suspect], a few hundred people were worshipping at the time. The muazzin has been here for 25 years, calling the prayer five times a day. He is very respected. 
“The attacker is not known to us, a few have seen him before. I heard the scuffle, the muazzin yelled and screamed, the imam ended the prayer. It was 30 seconds of mayhem. Everybody’s reaction was shock and horror, the men were screaming. 
“It was a vicious attack. We live in a society where we hear a lot about knife crime and what have you, but actually to physically be in a situation where you’re first-hand watching an attempted murder take place, it’s very shocking.” 
He added: “This guy was not a regular. I’ve never seen him here in 10 years.” 
Waleed Mohammed, a friend of the victim, described him as a well-loved community figure who did not know his attacker. He said: “He was a witness at my wedding, he is a gentle person, so welcoming, well loved in the community. He didn’t know the perpetrator.” 
Adnan Idha, 54, a regular worshipper at the mosque, said the attacker had spent time with his victim and had been seen sitting with him in his office. He told PA the attacker had joined the mosque around three months ago, and he had seen him in recent days at evening prayer. 
Around 6,000 people a week worship at the mosque, which is one of the largest Islamic places of worship in the UK. 
Boris Johnson tweeted that he was “deeply saddened” by the attack and added: “It’s so awful that this should happen, especially in a place of worship.” 
 
 
  I'm deeply saddened to hear of the attack at the London Central Mosque. It's so awful that this should happen, especially in a place of worship. My thoughts are with the victim and all those affected.— Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) 
  February 20, 2020
  
 
Images posted on social media showed the alleged attacker, who was barefoot, being pinned to the floor of the mosque by police officers as worshippers looked on. In one video, a knife was seen on the floor under a plastic chair. 
A statement on the mosque’s website confirmed that the victim had been calling worshippers to prayer. “There was an incident today at London Central Mosque where an unknown individual attacked and stabbed the muazzin [the person who makes the call to prayer] during Asr prayer around 3pm,” a statement said. 
“The attacker was apprehended by the worshippers until the police arrived and arrested him. The muazzin did not sustain any life-threatening injuries but was seriously injured and is being treated at the hospital. 
“We await further information from the police regarding the incident. Our thoughts and prayers are with the muazzin and his family.” 
Helen Harper, chief superintendent for the Met’s central-west borough command unit, said although it was believed to be an isolated incident, patrols had been increased around the area of the mosque to provide reassurance to worshippers and the local community. 
She added: “I would like to thank everybody in the mosque who helped to detain the man before he was arrested and continue to help my officers with their inquiries. I’m extremely relieved the injuries suffered by the victim do not appear to be life-threatening. 
“However, this incident has undoubtedly caused a great deal of concern and we are working as swiftly as possible to establish the circumstances. No other suspects are being sought at this time.”  
The ambulance service said: “We sent an ambulance crew, a paramedic in a car and an advanced paramedic practitioner to this incident in Regent’s Park. We treated a man at the scene and took him to a major trauma centre.”"
73,terror,"For once, TV caught the confusion and terror of playing in the NFL","The NFL’s “Mic’d Up” segments, in which we’re given audio of individual players during a game, are an odd concept. They’re supposed to give the viewer a peek behind the curtain: come see what’s really happening, yet they rarely inform the viewer. The really interesting parts – the play-calling, the foul-mouthed outbursts, the moments that show players as anything other than dedicated to the league and its product – are airbrushed out because the NFL wants to present a wholesome product. Packaging a game built atop testosterone, arrogance and violence to middle America requires such finagling of footage – NFL Films decides what audio it passes on to the broadcaster, so the audience hears only a very small fraction of what goes on during a game. And so we hear the platitudes and coach-speak. We get the sweet, pregame interactions between teammates, players of the past or guests of honor. We get the whooping and hollering. And we get the clapping – so much clapping. And yet, every now and then, something slips past the censors. On Monday night, New York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold played his worst game as a pro, committing five turnovers against the New England Patriots. In the second quarter, after his third giveaway, he went to the sideline and said, “I’m seeing ghosts.” The clip instantly went viral. Darnold essentially admitted he was out of his depth against New England coach Bill Belichick, as was evident to anyone with eyes.   Related: 'I'm seeing ghosts': Pats terrorize Darnold and Jets in Monday night massacre    Why Darnold’s admission sent the Jets into such a tizzy – they were said to be furious that his comments were aired – is interesting. Was such a revelation a shock? Of course Darnold was confused by the Patriots. They have the best defense in football and are coached by Belichick, the greatest defensive mind in league history. Darnold is only in his second season as a professional, and Belichick has confused and clobbered the game’s best for decades. The list of quarterbacks he has outwitted is littered with Hall of Famers: Peyton Manning, Kurt Warner, Jim Kelly, and on and on. Warner himself came to Darnold’s defense, saying even the best quarterbacks sometimes find themselves dazed and confused during games. If someone uses Darnold’s in-the-moment doubts to evaluate his long-term prospects or overall talent, more fool them.    Can we quit making a big deal of #SamDarnolds “Seeing Ghosts” reference - if you have ever played the position at NFL level you have been in a situation where u have seen “ghosts” - even the great @TomBrady! It happens &amp; u have to fight against allowing it to affect you!&mdash; Kurt Warner (@kurt13warner) October 22, 2019    Darnold admitting his confusion was the most illuminating thing from a Monday Night Football broadcast in years. Rather than see that as a positive, network execs will kowtow to the league – who wield the leverage of future TV contracts and competition from tech giants Amazon, Apple, Twitter and Facebook – and become even more reserved. The Jets are already rethinking wearing microphones, according to the New York Times. Jets head coach Adam Gase put a voice to the concerns. “I don’t know if I’ve ever seen that,” Gase said. “Where somebody that was mic’d up was basically ... a comment like that was allowed to air.” What drivel. It’s rare that we get quality mic’d up segments, but when we do, they’re doozies. Darnold’s, in terms of its impact, has already entered the pantheon. Here are a few more classics. 1) Bill Belichick and Chad Ochocinco Belichick is a first-ballot Hall of Fame mic’d up participant. There are two reasons why: he offers little insight into his mind in public, so we must feast on any morsel he offers us – any sense of his galaxy brain or humanity. One of his classics is an exchange with former Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Ochocinco. As he often does against star receivers, Belichick planned to double-cover Ochocinco, and he let him know about it – probably as an attempt at intimidation. Belichick delighted in letting the receiver know his plan pre-game, even going so far as to give him the specific play-call “[Cover] 1 Double 85, [receiver number]”.    Seems like Belichick’s standard pre-game chat with alpha WR1s pic.twitter.com/5utHteKFTz&mdash; 🦆 (@kawhilawnerd) October 23, 2019    2) Bill Belichick and Derrick Mason Belichick is also the author of probably the spiciest mic’d up quote. “Why don’t we talk after the game?” says Belichick to Baltimore Ravens receiver Derrick Mason. The language gets a little stronger after that.    Bill Belichick and Derrick Mason’s trash talk never gets old pic.twitter.com/w9ARe8Iw6k&mdash; Bryan 🎃 (@BBBryan000) June 6, 2018    3) All things Jon Gruden You have to give this to Jon Gruden: the Oakland Raiders head coach is nothing if not himself. Long before he transformed from Super Bowl champion to living meme, he was entertaining the masses. Gruden has been, by his standards, more genteel since his return to coaching, but his time with Tampa remains legendary.              4) Cam Newton and Clay Matthews You couldn’t script it better than this. Cam Newton v Packers linebacker Clay Matthews. Matthews identified the Panthers’ play based on their formation and the alignment of the running back. “It’s that wheel route; it’s the wheel route,” Matthews signaled to the rest of the defense. Newton, with his trademark smile, loved what he heard. “You’ve been watching film too, huh?” he asked Matthews. “That’s cool. Watch this.” The Panthers ran the perfect counter to the Packers’ call. Touchdown.              5) Lamar Jackson Lamar Jackson had a monumental day against the Seahawks last Sunday, showing the kind of traits that make a great player great but don’t always show up in the box score. When the Ravens needed him to put the team on his back, on the road, in a hostile environment, against a swarming defense, he did so on back-to-back drives. It was a transformative game for the much-criticized quarterback, and it came with its own Hollywood moment.              On fourth down, head coach John Harbaugh turned to Jackson and asked him if he wanted to go for it. “Hell yeah, let’s go for it”, Jackson replied. It is the kind of soundbite the NFL wants you to hear, and this time they’re right. No cuss words, no selling out a player or a team’s strategy. Just a movie-star quarterback adding to his highlight reel."
74,terror,Anarchist climate protesters evicted from Paddington Green,"Squatters who had occupied Paddington Green police station, the UK’s former counter-terror policing hub, have been evicted after holding the building for three weeks. “More than 60 bailiffs, police and private security stormed the building just past seven o’clock in the morning,” the squatters said on the No Fixed Abode Anti-fascists blog. “The eviction order was granted by the high court in the past week, explicitly mentioning the disruption the squat has caused to police firearms training in the building.” Police said bailiffs accompanied by officers evicted 11 people from the building “without incident” and that the site had “been secured”. Squatters from a number of anarchist and radical environmentalist groups seized control of Paddington Green three weeks ago, in the name of the Green Anti-Capitalist Front (Gaf).   Related: Paddington Green: inside the anti-terror HQ taken over by climate anarchists    The occupation of what was at one point said to be Europe’s highest-security police station was a major embarrassment for the Metropolitan police. Squatters graffitied the names of men and women killed in police custody along the building’s façade, and spelled out “no justice, no peace” – a slogan of justice campaigns – in the windows of its tower. They had discovered that the site had been used for urban warfare firearms training by police or special forces. Among the detritus, which included bullet casings and grenade pins, was a photo of a man of south Asian appearance that had been used for target practice. The Met said the photo, supplied by McQueen Targets and named as “Raj” in its online brochure, was used “to assess whether the person is a potential threat or not”. The force claimed it was “one of many used by police forces … featuring persons of a range of ages, genders and races”, but no targets featuring individuals of other ethnicities were found in Paddington Green. Gaf had aimed to use Paddington Green as a base for a week of radical protest around climate and environmental issues, but switched the venue to an alternative squat after a court made the eviction order. The coalition, formed by members of groups including the Anarchist Federation, the Industrial Workers of the World, Reclaim the Power and XR Youth, is intended as a more radical alternative to Extinction Rebellion."
75,terror,Police raids find huge arms cache linked to Islamic terror group,"A significant arms cache, including a sniper rifle, a silencer and tracer rounds linked to the banned terrorist group al-Muhajiroun have been found in Coventry, the Observer can reveal. Officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit and MI5 are investigating the weapons haul, which also includes a shotgun and 200 rounds of ammunition, following raids at several addresses in the city. A statement from West Midlands Police, which assists the regional counter-terrorism unit, said: “Firearms and ammunition were recovered during the raids and a police investigation is ongoing.” Four men have been arrested, one of whom has links to the al-Muhajiroun network, according to sources. The group, active in the UK since the mid-1980s, disappeared after the July 2005 attacks on London, but maintained a presence under various different names. It was eventually banned in 2009 under legislation outlawing “glorification” of terrorism. Supporters of al-Muhajiroun, whose traditional centres of organisation are the East End of London and Luton, have carried out atrocities including the 2017 London Bridge attack, the July 2005 bombings and the murder of Lee Rigby in 2013, with a number fighting for Islamic State and al-Qaida abroad. Recent reports suggest the group is regenerating, buoyed by the release of convicted terrorists from prison. The head of national counter-terror policing, Neil Basu, said the security services were working to disrupt terrorist activity by al-Muhajiroun. Of the four men arrested in Coventry on suspicion of firearms offences, a 51-year-old and a 37-year-old remain on bail. Counter-terrorism officers raided two addresses in the city on 3 July and two more on 15 July. A source said one of the arrested men had links with the al-Muhajiroun network before leaving the group and had reappeared on the security services’ radar after acquiring firearms. The source said: “The ones to worry about are those who join the group and leave. They then fall into two categories: either going back into normal life and thinking those guys were a bunch of jokers; or getting really serious – and they are the ones to follow. “The main guy [in this case] was in the purview of ALM and then jetted out like a comet and became a lot more serious than ALM could ever dream of being.” Last year al-Muhajiroun’s British-born leader, Anjem Choudary, was released from prison after being convicted for his activities to support Isis. Choudary has no connection to the arms cache uncovered in Coventry and has always denied allegations that he has either incited or glorified acts of terrorism. A number of ALM members travelled to Syria and Iraq to join Islamic State, including Siddhartha Dhar, a former bouncy-castle salesman from London, who was on bail for terrorism offences when he travelled to the Middle East to join the terror group. After being banned in 2009, the group resurfaced under various different banners with one, Islam4UK, creating headlines after protesting in Luton against British soldiers returning from Iraq, a demonstration that helped to form the far-right English Defence League. The West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit is one of 11 regional counter-terrorism units that form the National Counter Terrorism Policing Network that bring together intelligence, operations and investigative capabilities around the UK to prevent and prosecute terrorist activities. The finding of military-grade tracer rounds is particularly unusual in the UK."
76,terror,Australian internet providers told to block websites hosting Christchurch terror video,"Australian internet service providers have been ordered to block eight websites hosting video of the Christchurch terrorist attacks. In March, shortly after the Christchurch massacre, Australian telecommunications companies and internet providers began proactively blocking websites hosting the video of the Christchurch shooter murdering more than 50 people or the shooter’s manifesto. A total of 43 websites based on a list provided by Vodafone New Zealand were blocked.  The government praised the internet providers despite the action being in a legally grey area by blocking the sites from access in Australia for people not using virtual private networks (VPNs) or other workarounds. To avoid legal complications the prime minister, Scott Morrison, asked the e-safety commissioner and the internet providers to develop a protocol for the e-safety commissioner to order the websites to block access to the offending sites.   Related: Australian telcos block dozens of websites hosting Christchurch terror video    The order issued on Sunday covers just eight websites, after several stopped hosting the material, or ceased operating, such as 8chan.  The order means the e-safety commissioner will be responsible for monitoring the sites. If they remove the material they can be unblocked. The blocks will be reviewed every six months. “The remaining rogue websites need only to remove the illegal content to have the block against them lifted,” the e-safety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said. She said each time a site was blocked the agency would assess whether site-blocking powers need to kick in. She said there had not been an incident since Christchurch that had warranted it. “There is a high threshold, and there is parliamentary oversight, as there should be,” she said. “The slippery slope argument I keep seeing [is] this is not obscene content or objectionable content [but] it’s clearly illegal. I don’t see any public interest in making this kind of material that is designed to humiliate and to incite further terrorist acts and hatred.” The communications minister, Paul Fletcher, said the site-blocks were not intended to be a silver bullet. “We cannot allow this type of horrific material to be used to incite further violence or terrorist acts,” he said. “Website blocking is not a universal solution to online harms, but it is important that this option be available to the e-safety commissioner in extreme cases such as this.” Communications Alliance, which represents internet service providers in Australia, welcomed the certainty provided by the direction. “We are pleased to see the framework that is now in place as a result of constructive collaboration between industry, government and its agencies,” its chief executive, John Stanton, said. Inman Grant also revealed that under the government’s recently passed abhorrent violent material legislation, the e-safety commissioner has issued four notices to websites for hosting child abuse material. It had successfully got the websites to take down the material."
77,terror,PM ‘must launch urgent inquiry into Dominic Cummings’s reign of terror’,"Senior politicians, a former cabinet secretary and an ex-head of the home civil service have called for a top-level inquiry into how Boris Johnson’s closest aide, Dominic Cummings, was able to sack an adviser to Sajid Javid, the chancellor of the exchequer, without Javid’s knowledge and then order an armed police officer to escort her out of Downing Street in front of staff. 
A former senior Metropolitan police officer, former Chief Superintendent Dal Babu, also said the episode should be subject to urgent twin investigations by the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, and Scotland Yard. 
The demands for inquiries into the sacking last Thursday of Sonia Khan, the 27-year-old Treasury special adviser, came amid heightened tension at Westminster over Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks. 
The suspension, planned by Cummings for several weeks, was partly designed to limit the time MPs will have to block a no-deal Brexit. 
Saturday’s demonstrations against the shutting down of parliament featured protesters across the country chanting “stop the coup” and “save our democracy”. 
Cummings is understood to have concluded that Khan had been dishonest about her recent contacts with her ex-boss, the anti-no deal former chancellor Philip Hammond, and one of his ex-aides – accusations that Khan strongly denies. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
Having summoned her to No 10 on Thursday evening to question her, Cummings took her two phones, one used for private calls and one for work, and fired her after seeing she had talked to an ex-aide to Hammond last week. Cummings then went outside No 10 and asked an armed officer to enter the building and escort Khan off the premises. 
Friends of Khan said she was deeply upset by the episode and was considering what action to take next. They accused Cummings of establishing a “reign of terror” at the heart of government. 
Hammond is heavily involved in attempts by a cross-party group of MPs to prevent a no-deal Brexit by passing legislation when MPs return to Westminster this week. They hope a new law can be passed mandating Johnson to ask the EU for a further extension to the UK’s membership if the prime minister cannot strike a deal soon. 
 
  Related: Final sovereignty on Brexit must rest with the people  
 
On Saturday Hammond condemned “staggeringly hypocritical” plans to withdraw the whip from Conservative MPs if they vote against the government’s policy on Brexit. In a tweet, he said: “If true, this would be staggeringly hypocritical: 8 members of the current cabinet have defied the party whip this year. I want to honour our 2017 manifesto which promised a ‘smooth and orderly’ exit and a ‘deep and special partnership’ with the EU. Not an undemocratic No Deal.” 
On Friday, Javid confronted Johnson in a heated meeting and demanded an explanation into how the volatile Cummings had dismissed one of his staff without telling him beforehand. 
Former attorney general Dominic Grieve told the Observer that if the accounts of the sacking, not denied by Downing Street, were true, it was an outrageous abuse of power by Cummings and inappropriate of the police to have got involved. “If the facts are correct Mr Cummings’s behaviour in inviting the police into what at most could only have been an employment issue is deeply troubling. It was wrong of the police to get involved.” 
He said the prime minister needed to explain why “ordinary principles of fair behaviour have broken down in his office, and hold an inquiry by the cabinet secretary”. 
Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the House of Commons home affairs select committee, said: “Government advisers must not abuse their power by drawing the police into heavy- handed political stunts. This needs to be reviewed by the cabinet secretary and the Metropolitan police straight away.” 
Former cabinet secretary Lord Turnbull said it was up to No 10 to explain under what authority Cummings had been working when he dismissed a fellow special adviser and why he thought he had the right to ask an armed officer to march her out of Downing Street. “Getting one of the armed police to escort an adviser out of Downing Street is deeply offensive and is part of Cummings’s mantle of fear,” he said. 
The former head of the home civil service, Lord Kerslake, also called for an urgent inquiry by the cabinet secretary. 
Before parliament’s return on Tuesday, when MPs from all opposition parties will try to block a no-deal Brexit, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on Saturday accused Johnson of mounting a “smash and grab raid on our democracy” to force through no-deal Brexit. 
Writing in the Observer Corbyn said Johnson “is running scared of being held to account” and calls for a general election in which Labour would commit to another Brexit referendum. 
“A general election is the democratic way forward. And in that election Labour will give the people the chance to take back control and have the final say in a public vote, with credible options for both sides, including the option to remain.” 
Dal Babu who served in the Met for 30 years said that police officers should not have been asked to march Khan out of Downing Street. “It’s a shocking abuse of armed officers, it’s appalling. The police should be asking questions of Cummings, asking questions of the prime minister around an abuse of process. At a time when we should be proud of having BAME women at the heart of government this sends out a very wrong signal of how people are valued. 
“I would expect the cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill to conduct an inquiry and I would expect the police to conduct an inquiry about individuals in No 10 utilising police officers in a very inappropriate way.”"
78,terror,Rise in rightwing extremists held under anti-terror laws in UK,"Thirty-three rightwing extremists were held under anti-terror laws last year, a steady rise which coincided with another decrease in the number of Islamist extremists detained. The figures, released by the Home Office, compare with the 28, 10 and six people from a suspected far-right background who were detained in previous years. By comparison, the number of suspected Islamist extremists being held peaked in the 12 months to the end of June 2017, when 185 people believed to have Islamist extremist ideologies were in custody in prison and on remand for a terror-related offence. It dropped to 178 last year, and 171 in the 12 months to the end of June this year, according to the figures which were published on Thursday. The far-right cohort includes individuals from politically far-right groups such as National Action, which became the first extreme rightwing group to be proscribed as a terrorist organisation in 2016. Individuals who were found guilty of membership of National Action last year included a neo-Nazi couple who named their baby son after Hitler and a British army veteran who served in Afghanistan. The security minister, Brandon Lewis, said of the latest figures: “These statistics show just one part of the breadth of work undertaken by the government, police, security and intelligence agencies and local authorities to reduce the terrorist threat. “From arrests and prosecutions to safeguarding and early intervention through our Prevent programme, we will continue to do what it takes to keep the public safe.” However, the comments from Lewis come as the Home Office continues to face criticism that it is not taking the far-right threat seriously enough. A study by a Whitehall thinktank of far-right fundraising activities found that an “unwillingness” by the UK government to engage with the threat was creating a vacuum in which such groups could flourish. Overall, there were were 266 arrests for suspected terrorism-related activity in the last year, down from 354 in the previous 12 months, in what is a continuation of a downward trend. Of those arrested in 2018/19, nearly a quarter (23%) were released without charge – the lowest percentage since records began following the 11 September terror attacks in 2001. In 2017/18, nearly half (48%) of all those arrested were released without charge, down from 53% the previous year. British prisons held 218 people in custody for terrorism-related offences as recently as 30 June, according to other Home Office statistics, a figure which was unchanged since the previous year. Of those, 78% were categorised as holding Islamist-extremist views while a further 15% were categorised as holding far rightwing ideologies. The remaining prisoners, 6%, held beliefs related to other ideologies."
79,terror,When is Trump going to take white supremacist terror seriously?,"In a bloody weekend that saw two back-to-back mass shootings, a white male gunman left at least 20 people dead in a Walmart in El Paso, a majority Latino border town. Minutes before the attack on Saturday, the suspect, Patrick Crusius, published a 2,300-word manifesto, which was filled with white nationalist language and racist hatred toward immigrants and Latinos: “This attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas” he wrote. The media, and Americans generally, are desperately wanting to make sense of yet another young white male mass shooter. And nothing Donald Trump has done or advocated for has remotely stemmed the epidemic of mass shootings since he took office. We should be treating online alt-right and white supremacist radicalization with the exact same seriousness with which we treat online jihadist radicalization. Unfortunately, we are far from doing that. After serial bomber Mark Anthony Conditt, a young white man, killed three innocent strangers in Austin, Texas, then injured a police officer as he blew himself up, the Austin police chief called Conditt’s gruesome suicide video “the outcry of a very challenged young man talking about challenges in his personal life that led him to this point”. For its part, the New York Times told readers that the Austin killer was “an intense loner who grew up in a tight-knit, deeply religious family, according to friends and neighbors”. Similarly, in its headlines, FoxNews.com reminded readers about Conditt: “Austin package bomb victim remembered as boy who ‘could have accomplished anything’.” There is a sharp repudiation mixed with a racialized empathy for these young white killers, and the empathy is often telegraphed through flattering commentary on their intellect and technological knowhow. This commentary echoes the early media coverage of the Columbine school shooters, avowed white racists who perpetrated the worst mass school shooting at the time, in 1999. The media marveled at the young white shooters’ “skills”. They reported on Eric Harris’ involvement with a “program for gifted and talented children” and noted that Dylan Klebold “helped maintain the school computer server. He also built his own home computer”. How do we make meaning of young white male killers? What cognitive and rhetorical gymnastics are necessary from Americans to disavow these “native sons” even as we bend over backwards wanting to understand them? The political rhetoric that produces these killers, and our yearning to empathize with them as human beings, is full of racial dog-whistles. These killers know what they are doing. With pathos and cunning, they utilize the press in the execution of their crimes. The mainstream media fetishizes the killers’ social “alienation”. They do deep dives into the killers’ online writing. The media extensively quoted Dylann Roof’s blog, the Last Rhodesian, as well as Conditt’s blog, Defining My Stance, as if combing through a philosophical tract for thoughtful reflection and insights. The implication? These kids have interesting and worthwhile and culturally resonant viewpoints, and certainly more so than, say, the viewpoints of a drug trafficker, who happens to be Latina. Their social media posts, blogs and video diaries deliver a meta-commentary, that helps manipulate how their crimes are discussed in public debate. Based on my anthropological research of majority-white communities, I believe the increasing atomization, privatization and segregation of suburban environments results in precarious communities and more loneliness among many suburban white youth. At a time when they are going through a demographic decline, white male youths are increasingly developing their sense of self and belonging through digital media, as opposed to, say, through traditional institutions like the church and quality schools. The profound social changes they are experiencing make these young men susceptible to white nationalist ideology – and the Trump administration is doing far too little to take this threat seriously. This year, there have been at least 32 fatal shootings with three or more victims in the United States. In the aftermath of a recent killing, the FBI director, Christopher Wray, said that he has focused on stopping violence rather than ideology: one can think anything one wants, Wray said, but being violent is what gets the FBI’s attention. Yet while the Trump administration has shown little interest in stopping extreme racist ideology, they haven’t had much success in preventing the spate of white-nationalist motivated crimes either. Days after the Tree of Life synagogue massacre in Squirrel Hill, Pittsburgh, I attended a private community healing meeting, alongside the Pittsburgh mayor, Bill Peduto. I offered a presentation for local activists, rabbis, progressive philanthropists and community members about extreme violence and white nationalism. “Moderates” and “apolitical” people should now know: there can no longer be any innocent “bystanders” when it comes to this extreme racial violence. After this latest massacre, and all the other recent rightwing shootings, we are all complicit when we look the other way.  We should be treating online alt-right and white supremacist radicalization with the same seriousness that we treat online jihadist radicalization. The problem is not only poor gun control. It is the refusal of the Trump administration to confront the white nationalist ideology that inspires violence. If the administration were serious about security, it would name and fight this problem, which is only growing since the president took office.

80,terror,Wednesday briefing: No deal will endanger UK – Met terror chief,"Top story: Call to tackle social causes of extremism 
Hello, Warren Murray bringing you the stories that count this morning. 
The UK’s safety and security would suffer from a no-deal Brexit with the loss of key crime-fighting tools – and no amount of planning and preparation can erase the risk, Neil Basu, Britain’s head of counter-terrorism, has warned. “We can make them [the damaging effects] less, but they would be slower systems. Those systems and tools were developed in the EU for very good reason. They were very good. We had just signed up to biometric sharing. In a no-deal we’d lose all that. We’d have to renegotiate it.” 
Basu has told the Guardian that the police and security services are no longer enough to defeat violent extremism and the UK must instead improve community cohesion, social mobility and education. The Scotland Yard assistant commissioner said up to 80% of those who wanted to attack the UK were British-born or raised. Both Islamist and extreme rightwing terrorists have continued to recruit Britons, despite efforts to thwart them, with violent nationalism fuelled by the Brexit vote. “I want good academics, good sociologists, good criminologists … to be telling us exactly why that is. It might be everything from high anxiety, to lack of confidence, lack of education, things that may have happened to them when they are young, bullying, racism, bigotry, lack of opportunity, early experiences with law enforcement even, domestic violence.”

‘Oppressive language is violence’ – Toni Morrison, who chronicled the African American experience in fiction over five decades, has died aged 88. Morrison first came to prominence as an acclaimed editor and then with novels such as The Bluest Eye, Song of Solomon and Beloved. Her career garnered honours including the Pulitzer and Nobel prizes, the Légion d’Honneur and a Presidential Medal of Freedom presented to her in 2012 by her friend Barack Obama. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
In words that resonate in these times, Morrison in her 1993 Nobel acceptance speech spelled out the dangers of “oppressive language [that] does more than represent violence; it is violence; does more than represent the limits of knowledge; it limits knowledge”. Leading authors have offered tributes: among them, Ben Okri, Alice Walker and Bonnie Greer, the latter writing: “Like her equal, Whitman, she cannot be imitated.”

Britain unplugged – The UK risks being left behind in Europe’s home battery boom because of a tax hike on solar battery systems, according to a report. The energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie predicts that by 2024, annual home battery installations across Europe could total more than 500MW, the equivalent of building a new gas-fired power plant every year. But it will be more difficult for UK households to access the potential of low-cost renewable energy after a VAT increase on solar batteries installed from October – as well as Britain’s “unfavourable” policy framework”, says the report. The government has blamed EU rules for the VAT change, a claim disputed by Molly Scott Cato, a Green MEP for South West England.

‘Tax trap’ tamed – NHS pension rules blamed for deterring senior doctors and nurses from working additional shifts for fear of hefty tax bills are to be overhauled. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the move would ensure senior clinicians in England and Wales fully benefited from any extra work they took on. However, some hospital doctors are warning the NHS is already facing “a full-blown winter meltdown” as a result of the crisis caused by the pension rules. Rule changes introduced in 2016 meant rising numbers of consultants and other senior staff were facing unexpected tax bills linked to the value of their pensions. Operations and clinics were cancelled as NHS senior staff withdrew from working extra shifts that would put them in the pension penalty zone.

Stop it now – Scientists have come up with a defence against the menace of food-snatching seagulls: stare them out. Madeleine Goumas, a postgraduate researcher at Exeter University, ventured to Falmouth, St Ives, Newquay and other popular seaside spots. She placed a sealed bag of chips about an arm’s length away and timed when the seagulls swooped. According to her study in Biology Letters, they were less likely to approach food when she locked eyes with them. Dr Viola Ross-Smith, at the British Trust for Ornithology, backs this up based on years of her own work on seagulls. “They have dive-bombed me, screamed at me, regurgitated and defecated. It’s not glamorous work,” she said. “But in my experience, if you look at the gulls, they either stay on the ground and look back at you or back off.” Unclear whether it also works on rats, which have been recorded grazing the shelves of a Japanese grocer – leading to the store shutting its doors.

81,terror,Man arrested by armed counter-terror police in London,"Armed police have arrested a man at his home in London following a security service investigation into a potential jihadist plot. The 20-year-old was detained early on Friday after a raid by Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command in south-west London. The level of potential danger required armed police to be present, according to an assessment by police chiefs. Police said the man was arrested under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and taken to a police station for questioning. In a statement, the Met said no one was injured during the operation. “It is not believed there was any imminent threat to the public,” it added. The police investigation will try to determine if concerns were correct and what if anything may have been being planned. The Met said the arrest was not related to two arrests made on Wednesday in Luton. In that operation a 28-year-old man and 25-year-old woman were arrested after a car in which they were travelling was stopped by police. Both were arrested under under section 41 of the Terrorism Act. A warrant for their further detention has been granted, allowing them to be held into next week while investigations continue. Police said a residential address and a commercial premises in Luton were searched and both the man and woman were brought to London for questioning at a police station, where they remained on Friday. The terrorism threat level in the UK remains at severe, meaning an attack is highly likely."
82,terror,EU clamps down on free ports over crime and terrorism links,"Brussels is clamping down on 82 free ports or free zones after identifying that their special tariff and duty status has aided the financing of terrorism, money laundering and organised crime. A set of new rules was introduced by the European commission just weeks before the launch on Monday of a UK government consultation on the creation of up to 10 free ports in post-Brexit Britain. Authorities across the EU have been obliged since 10 January to take extra measures to identify and report suspicious activities at the ports and zones as a result of the “high incidence of corruption, tax evasion, criminal activity”. The EU’s executive branch has said it will review the issue again next year owing to the popularity of such ports among high-net-worth individuals and criminal organisations seeking to circumvent recent crackdowns on bank secrecy.   Related: Government officials working on plans for bridge linking Scotland to Ireland, No 10 confirms – live news    Free ports or free zones are a type of special economic zone (SEZ) where business and trade laws differ from those in the rest of the country. Goods can be landed, stored, handled, manufactured or reconfigured and re-exported without being subject to customs duty. Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the UK Treasury, inaccurately claimed on Monday that “the EU is pretty much the only place in the world that doesn’t use free ports”. In reality, the EU’s customs code does allow for free ports or zones and there are 82 of them across the countries that are subject to its regulations. The Isle of Man, a British crown dependency that is neither part of the EU nor the UK, operates a free port. The British government has said it wants the first to be opened in the UK by 2021. In July, the commission said free ports, popular for the storage of art, precious stones, antiques, gold and wine as alternative assets to cash, posed an emerging threat in multiple ways. The ports are said to allow counterfeiters to land consignments, tamper with loads or associated paperwork and re-export the products without customs intervention, disguising the true origin and nature of the goods, and the identity of the original supplier. The commission said they were also used for narcotics trafficking, the illegal ivory trade, people smuggling, VAT fraud, corruption and money laundering. “Legal businesses owned by criminals remain key to money-laundering activities”, the report said. “Free ports are perceived as facilities that protect their clients’ identity and financial dealings, much as private banks used to.” As an example of the nefarious activities taking place at such sites, the commission noted that in December 2016, Swiss authorities seized cultural relics looted from Syria, Libya and Yemen that were being stored in Geneva’s free ports. “The looters had brought the confiscated objects to Switzerland via Qatar”, the EU report said. “Three of the pieces were from the ancient city of Palmyra, a Unesco world heritage site systematically destroyed by [Islamic State] jihadists who had seized it in May 2015.” “Free ports are conducive to secrecy,” the report added. “With their preferential treatment, they resemble offshore financial centres, offering a high degree of security and discretion, and permitting transactions without attracting the attention of regulators or direct tax authorities.” The British government has argued that the proposed new zones could bring thousands of new jobs and significant investment but the conclusions of trade experts have been mixed. A report from the UK Trade Policy Observatory suggested the benefits would be “tiny”, while the construction group Mace argued the creation of free ports could create 150,000 new jobs and add £9bn a year to the UK economy. A report from the European parliament last year noted that a growing demand for free ports could in part be explained by a recent global crackdown on tax evasion. The US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and the OECD’s 2014 Common Reporting Standard (CRS) make it hard for individuals to escape taxation on proceeds of funds held in bank accounts."
83,terror,Year of the Rabbit by Tian Veasna review – art that speaks volumes,"I feel more and more that comics are capable of dealing even with the most difficult of subjects – an ability that has to do, I think, with their relative lack of words. Unlike a novel, they can make full use of silence. Pain may be seen in a glance on the faces of their characters; foreboding may be found in the sky and the trees. Tian Veasna’s brilliant and powerful book about the murderous reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, and the experiences of his family under the regime, is a case in point. Its storytelling is extremely nimble, making easy work of complex political history. But it’s also exquisitely spare. Sometimes, there is nothing to be said; no words are adequate. In these moments, Veasna lets his brush do the talking. Like a bird, he soars above the country where he was born, gazing down on its gutted cities, on its workers slaving in the fields. The documentary precision of his landscapes seems to do the work of a thousand written pages. Veasna was born in 1975, just three days after the Khmer Rouge seized power in Phnom Penh. Year of the Rabbit traces the day-to-day lives of his parents, first as they join the exodus of people from the cities to the countryside, and then later, as they plan their escape from a country that has in effect become a giant prison camp (eventually, they will make it to France, where he grew up and still lives). Veasna’s father, Khim, is a doctor, and as such is considered to be an intellectual enemy of the bizarrely philistine new Democratic Kampuchea, which prefers to put its faith in traditional medicine. So as he travels, he must hide his identity. This, however, is the least of his worries. The regime takes everything. People are starving. Spies and snitches are everywhere. In the villages, where the masses must wear identical clothes, follow identical routines, and work only for the glory of the motherland, growing your own tomato plant is enough to get you killed.     A page from Year of the Rabbit: ‘exquisitely spare’. Illustration: PR Handout    Year of the Rabbit is an account of terror and unimaginable loss. But it’s not only this. I felt slightly guilty that I found it so exciting – and it was an education, too. Veasna punctuates his story with detailed historical maps, and with a series of darkly funny panels in which he details some of the loopier and more arcane beliefs and practices of the Khmer Rouge. In one, he explains how a person might look like an enemy of the state (appear elegant or distinguished; hesitate when asked about the past). In another, he draws one of the “new people” of Kampuchea, and the very few things he is allowed to own: a lice comb; a spoon; one bar of soap per family, per year. Beyond the fear, the disappearances and the mass graves, as Veasna reveals again and again, there lies a terrible absurdity: those old bedfellows, stupidity and cruelty, go hand in hand, each cheering the other on from the sidelines as their heinous work is done. • Year of the Rabbit by Tian Veasna is published by Drawn and Quarterly (£22.50).

84,terror,The Guardian view on policing protest: not a job for counter-terrorism,"Surprise will have been many people’s understandable reaction to learning that Extinction Rebellion, the environmentalist network, was listed by British counter-terrorism police alongside violent neo-Nazi and Islamist groups in a guide to “extremist ideologies”. The document, issued to schools, included instructions to look out for those who use “strong or emotive terms” when discussing climate change or pollution. Since 2015, teachers have been under a statutory duty to refer students suspected of extremist sympathies to the anti-terror Prevent programme, with education now the main source of referrals (in 2017-18 these included 2009 children under 15). A suggestion that participation “in planned school walkouts” could be grounds for suspicion is particularly egregious, given that the school strike movement’s stated aim is for governments to act on climate scientists’ warnings. But what is particularly dispiriting about this ill-judged document is that the bracketing of green groups with terrorists is far from a one-off. Instead, and as numerous activists spied on by police in the past know (including an unknown number of women tricked into sexual relationships by officers), the treatment of environmentalists as dangerous subversives is consistent with longstanding attitudes to green issues at the highest levels of the British state. Such views do not have a monopoly. Sir Peter Fahy, the former police chief who led Prevent from 2010 to 2015, has criticised the approach to Extinction Rebellion as counterproductive. But at a time when public concern about the climate emergency in many countries has never been higher, with bushfires ravaging Australia and new analysis showing record rises in ocean temperatures, the decision of the home secretary, Priti Patel, to highlight alleged “security risks” from green groups when asked about the issue is grounds for alarm. Climate policymaking is a global challenge and the stakes in 2020 could not be higher. If legally binding cuts on greenhouse gas emissions are not agreed at a crunch round of UN talks in December, then the world will be in a very dark place indeed (experts say emissions must be reduced by 7.6% per year for a decade if we are to avoid the most destructive scenarios). With that summit due to be held in Glasgow, the UK government has a vital role to play. But so does civil society, including activist groups such as Extinction Rebellion. The litany of failures of climate policy so far suggests that unless millions of people exert pressure on their leaders, governments will fail to take the necessary steps. In this context, it is a grotesque distortion of reality to suggest that young people who join peaceful climate protests bear any resemblance to terrorists. Fossil fuel companies, and asset managers such as Vanguard that consistently oppose climate resolutions, show far greater recklessness with regard to human life. Extinction Rebellion’s founders may declare support for alternatives to capitalism, but their grasp of climate science belongs not beyond the pale, but in the mainstream. Of course, the police must prepare for the disruption caused by civil disobedience. Such actions do not command universal support and in some cases are planned to maximise pressure on police resources. But none of this has anything to do with counter-terrorism. The government’s delayed review of Prevent must now take place, with a thorough examination of this episode as part of its remit, and clear advice as to how those affected can seek redress."
85,terror,Sudan will never prosper while it is on the US terrorism blacklist,"Over the past year, the Sudanese people have staged a near miraculous revolution, overthrowing the 30-year dictatorship of President Omar al-Bashir. Following mediation led by the African Union and Ethiopia, a transitional government consisting of civilians and military generals is headed by Abdalla Hamdok, a veteran economist untainted by the decades of corruption and misrule. It is the best compromise: the army, and especially the paramilitary Rapid Support Force, are simply too powerful to be removed from politics in one fell swoop.  At the UN general assembly in September, and last week in Washington DC, Hamdok made a series of good-faith policy pledges to return Sudan to the club of respectable nations. Hamdok is charged with the gargantuan task of steering Sudan out of crisis and into a period of economic stability and growth. But what brought the first demonstrators on to the streets a year ago was rampant inflation and the collapse of the wage-earning economy: ordinary people simply couldn’t afford to buy bread or fuel. That hasn’t changed. The economy remains on the slide towards hyperinflation and the people towards possible famine. Wealthy Gulf states – Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – bailed out Sudan with $3.5bn (£2.65bn) worth of cash and commodities earlier this year. That was never enough, given the magnitude of the crisis, and it is running out. What Sudan needs is for its debt to be rescheduled and sanctions against it lifted. That will require action by the US to remove Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism (SST). Among other restrictions, inclusion on the list prohibits economic assistance, including loans from the World Bank and other international financial institutions. International sanctions on Sudan began shortly after the last democratic revolution in 1985, when the International Monetary Fund suspended the country for non-payment of arrears on its debts. Intended to compel fiscal responsibility, that economic shackle condemned the democratic government to failure. So began a catalogue of foreign sanctions, mostly a story of mishap and failure. In 1993, the US designated Sudan as an SST. Four years later, it imposed comprehensive economic, trade, and financial sanctions. In 2007, in response to the Darfur atrocities, Washington imposed further measures including individually targeted asset freezes. The measures hurt the regime, but also the people. The economic and trade sanctions were eased in 2017-18, in a rare example of policy continuity between the Obama and Trump administrations. But the biggest measure remains in place: the SST listing. That basically prohibits anyone from doing business with Sudan without a special licence from the US Treasury; the alternative is prosecution.  And while legitimate business stays shackled, illicit business continues to thrive. Sudanese people call it the “deep state” – at best crony capitalists profiteering from oil and gold sales, and from the security agencies’ lockdown of the financial and telecom sectors, and at worst mafia cartels. Along with their soldiers on the streets, this financial muscle is the power base of the generals. The military oligarchs’ power will start eroding when exposed to the fair winds of free competition – when sanctions are lifted. The state department candidly admits that all its main objectives have been met: Sudan isn’t a state sponsor of terror and, indeed, has been cooperating with the US for years; it let South Sudan secede peacefully, and has been assisting in trying to resolve its neighbour’s civil war; and it is committed to democratic reform, and peace with the remaining provincial rebels in Darfur and Southern Kordofan.   Related: UN peacekeepers intervene after violent clashes in South Sudan    But the US has not yet properly recognised the once-in-a-generation achievement of the Sudanese people. Last week, Washington made the symbolic gesture of sending an ambassador to Khartoum and followed up with promises of incremental progress towards normalising relations. But removing the SST listing has been made dependent on Hamdok enacting a series of reforms, which is like sending a boxer into the ring with one hand tied behind his back, telling him: “If you can knock out the other guy, then we will untie your hand.” If Sudan’s economy slides into complete meltdown and the civilian administration fails, the rug pulled from under Hamdok’s feet will have “Made in the US” written all over it. If the US administration – and Congress, which must approve the lifting of sanctions – wants to be on the right side of history in Sudan, it must respond expeditiously to the Sudanese people’s plea. • El-Ghassim Wane is a former African Union and UN official with responsibilities for peace and security.

87,terror,UK freed 42 terrorists in year before law to detain extremists for longer,"More than 40 convicted terrorists were released from prison in the year before emergency legislation was introduced to keep jailed extremists locked up for longer, figures reveal, while the number of far-right detainees has surged. After a non-fatal terror attack in south-west London last month, the government fast-tracked laws to prevent the automatic release of terrorist offenders without Parole Board assessment. The new laws, which came into force a week ago, were applied retrospectively, meaning serving prisoners will stay in prison longer than expected. But according to the latest figures on use of the Terrorism Act, in the year to September 2019, 42 convicted terrorists were released from custody after serving prison sentences, some of whom would have been released automatically at the halfway point of their sentence with no Parole Board assessment. Meanwhile, the figures reveal that the number of prisoners classed as rightwing extremists who are behind bars for terrorism offences has almost doubled in two years. In the year to the end of December, there were 41 people in custody categorised as holding extreme rightwing ideology, up from just a handful of cases five years ago –four in 2014 – to 21 for the same period in 2017 and 28 in 2018. Last month, a proscription order was issued, making membership of the neo-nazi group Sonnenkrieg Division illegal in the UK. It also recognised System Resistance Network as an alias of the already banned neo-Nazi group National Action. Anyone found to be a member of, or offering support to, the groups could now face up to 10 years in jail. Overall, as of 31 December, there were 231 people in custody for terrorism-related offences, the “vast majority”, or 77%, branded as holding Islamist-extremist views.   Related: Longer jail time for terrorists could backfire, says watchdog    The convicted terrorist Sudesh Amman, who was shot dead by plain-clothes officers after he stabbed two people on 2 February, was released about 10 days before he launched the assault on a busy Streatham High Road. He had been released automatically at the midway point of his sentence despite authorities having serious concerns about the risk he posed to the public. Under the emergency laws, all terrorist offenders will now have to serve two thirds of their sentence before being eligible for a Parole Board assessment and will not be automatically released. The proposals were in addition to a broad package of counter-terrorism measures announced by the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice, which included plans to introduce lie-detector tests for terrorist offenders as well as the recruitment of specialist counter-terrorism probation officers. The number of arrests for terrorism-related activity has dropped to the lowest number in six years – 280 to 31 December – but rose in the last quarter and remains higher than the annual average of 260. Of these, 110 (39%) people were released on bail or released under investigation – meaning they were not subjected to any restrictions while inquiries into the offences continued. There were 87 (31%) charged and 65 of these were for terrorism-related offences. A further 19 (7%) received a caution, were recalled to prison or handed over to immigration authorities and 63 suspects or 23% were released without charge. Commonly, sentences are consistently less than four years and were handed down for more than half of the convictions, 24 out of 46. Three offenders in the last year were handed a life sentence, down from six in the previous year, but the number of long-term sentences of more than 10 years rose slightly."
88,terror,Counter-terror police arrest two over alleged donation fraud,"Two people have been arrested by counter-terrorism police after a Charity Commission investigation into a Sikh youth group. A 38-year-old man and a 49-year-old woman were detained on Wednesday at an address in Birmingham, West Midlands police said. The arrests resulted from an examination of evidence found during searches in September last year and are linked to a commission investigation into the Sikh Youth UK organisation. The force said the arrests were “in connection with alleged fraud offences of donated charitable funds”. The commission said the inquiry was examining whether donations had been properly administered by Sikh Youth UK, its trustees’ conduct, its partnerships with other charities and its financial management. The profile of Sikh Youth UK has risen in recent years for campaigns that have included, as stated on its website, “raising awareness on social evils and supporting the victims of sexual grooming, substance abuse and domestic violence within the community”. Other activities have included commemorating those who died during Operation Blue Star, India’s bloody crackdown on Sikh separatists seeking independence, in 1984. Sikh Youth UK is not a registered charity but the independent regulator has jurisdiction over it because the funds being scrutinised in the investigation are charitable. Police raised concerns with the commission in October in relation to the group’s receipts and use of donations. The commission then obtained copies of bank statements and analysis identified “a number of regulatory concerns which warrant further investigation”. A formal inquiry was opened on 15 November by the commission, which said it would also examine the organisation’s status to determine whether it was a charity in law. A spokesperson said: “Those running the organisation have not applied to register with the commission.” West Midlands police said the two people arrested were being held at a station in the West Midlands."
89,terror,Pensacola shooting: FBI working with presumption it was 'act of terrorism',"Three days after a Saudi air force lieutenant shot dead three people at a naval base in Pensacola, Florida, the FBI said it was working “with the presumption that this was an act of terrorism”. The gunman who struck in a classroom at Naval Air Station Pensacola on Friday morning was killed by sheriff’s deputies, two of whom were among eight people wounded. All were expected to survive.   Related: Pensacola: suspect watched mass shooting videos at dinner party, official says    No arrests had been made, the FBI agent in charge said at a press conference on Sunday, adding that all international students at the base have been accounted for. “We are, as we do in most active-shooter investigations, working with the presumption that this was an act of terrorism,” said Rachel Rojas. “There are a number of Saudi students who are close to the shooter and continue to cooperate in this investigation. The Saudi government has pledged to fully cooperate with our investigation.” Saudi state media has reported that the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman called President Trump expressing his condolences for the families affected by the shooting. The crown prince also assured Trump that Saudi authorities would offer their absolute cooperation with the US and provide all information that would help the investigations. The defense secretary, Mark Esper, said he had asked the Pentagon to review screening procedures for soldiers from other countries sent to the US for training. Key allies of Donald Trump called for Saudi Arabia to be suspended from such programs. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammed Alshamrani, 21. A US official told the AP investigators believe Alshamrani visited New York City, including Rockefeller Center, days before the shooting. The FBI was attempting to question anyone who may have interacted with him, the official said. Authorities also believe the gunman made social media posts about US support for Israel and alleging Americans were anti-Muslim, the official said. Investigators were continuing to examine his online profiles and social media postings. On Saturday, a US official told the Associated Press the Saudi gunman hosted a dinner party this week where he and three others watched videos of mass shootings. The official said one of the three students who attended the party then recorded video outside the classroom building while the shooting took place, while two Saudi students watched from a car. Rojas said the FBI was “looking very hard at uncovering his motive and I would ask for patience so we can get this right”. She added that 80 FBI special agents, 100 support staff and scores of other investigators from the navy and multiple federal agencies were working the case.    There’s something really bad here. We need to slow this program down and reevaluate  Lindsey Graham     Rojas said the pistol used – a Glock 9mm handgun that can be paired with a magazine holding 33 rounds – was legally purchased somewhere in Florida. According to US regulations, it is legal for a foreigner on a non-immigrant visa to buy a gun if certain conditions are met, including if they simply have a hunting license. Esper appeared on Fox News Sunday. He said he had asked top defense officials to “make sure we’re taking all necessary precautions” to make sure military installations are secure. The shooting was the second at a US naval base in a week. A sailor whose submarine was docked at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, opened fire on three civilian employees on Wednesday, killing two before killing himself. Esper also said he had asked the Pentagon to “review what our screening procedures are” before soldiers from other countries come to the US for training programs he said were “very important to our national security”. More than 850 Saudis are in the US for training activities, among more than 5,000 foreign students from 153 countries. “This has been done for many decades,” Trump told reporters on Saturday. “I guess we’re going to have to look into the whole procedure. We’ll start that immediately.” Two leading Trump allies in Congress said Saudi Arabia should be suspended from US training programs. “We need to suspend the Saudi program until we find out what happened here,” the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham told Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo. Graham said he liked the idea of training foreign pilots “but there’s something really bad here. We need to slow this program down and re-evaluate.” Matt Gaetz, a Florida congressman whose district includes the base in Pensacola, told ABC’s This Week the shooting “has to inform our ongoing relationship with Saudi Arabia”. Saying he and Trump had been communicating regularly, he added: “We should not be taking new incoming Saudi students until we’re absolutely confident in our vetting process.” The navy identified the men who died and hailed them as heroes for trying to stop the gunman and flagging down first responders after being shot. Capt Tim Kinsella, commanding officer of Naval Air Station Pensacola, said in a statement: “When confronted, they didn’t run from danger; they ran towards it and saved lives.” One of the victims was a 23-year-old graduate of the US Naval Academy who alerted first responders to where the gunman was after he had been shot several times. “Joshua Kaleb Watson saved countless lives today with his own,” his older brother, Adam Watson, wrote on Facebook. “He died a hero and we are beyond proud.” Airman Mohammed Sameh Haitham, 19, of St Petersburg, Florida, joined the navy after graduating high school last year, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Haitham’s mother, Evelyn Brady, herself a navy veteran, said the commander of her son’s school called her and told her Haitham had tried to stop the gunman. The former track and field star had been assigned to flight crew training and was looking forward to graduating from the program later this month, she said. “He said he was going to get his flight jacket for Christmas,” she said. “Now that’s not going to happen.” The third victim was airman apprentice Cameron Scott Walters, 21, of Richmond Hill, Georgia."
90,terror,Streatham attacker was released amid fears he felt terrorism 'justified',"The Streatham attacker was released from a high security prison with investigators fearing he believed terrorist atrocities to be justified, the Guardian has learned. Sudesh Amman, 20, was placed under full surveillance from a unit of 30 officers on the day of his release from Belmarsh prison and within days prompted such concern from counter-terrorism officials that those tailing him were ordered to be armed. In prison he had declined to engage in programmes to manage his risk, and his behaviour during his sentence for terrorist offences following a 2018 conviction caused concern. One source with knowledge of the Amman case said: “He was as much a problem when he came out of prison as when he went in.” Officers were following Amman on Sunday as he started stabbing people with a knife he stole in a shop, days after controversially being released from a sentence for terrorism offences. Less than 10 seconds after he started his attack on Streatham High Road, armed surveillance officers who had been following him around the clock engaged him. He was shot dead less than 60 seconds after his attack began. One man, who was initially considered to be in a life-threatening condition, is still in hospital. The armed officers tracking Amman were part of a 24/7 surveillance operation, which is more expensive than keeping him in prison. He was released on 23 January, barely a week before he stabbed two people. His release from jail was automatic at the halfway point of his sentence. It is understood that there was no mechanism for a risk assessment to be factored into whether he should be freed. Powerless to stop him being released, prison and probation officials met with police to discuss the serious danger he was seen as posing. He was assessed as posing the highest risk, and they agreed to impose licence conditions on his release including the wearing of an electronic tag, a curfew, where he could go and restrictions on internet use. Police and MI5 also committed extensive resources to place Amman under round the clock surveillance – itself rare and a sign of the danger he was thought to present. The case was considered among the highest priorities by investigators and analysts trying to thwart an atrocity. On Monday evening police said that armed officers had been following Amman as he left a hostel at around 1.20pm on Sunday. Initial witness statements suggest that shortly after he entered a shop he stole a knife and then ran out as he was pursued by a member of staff. As he ran from the shop, he removed packaging from the knife, and once outside attacked two members of public, the police said. He is thought to have been wearing his fake suicide vest covered by a jacket, and thus out of view of the surveillance team following him. Police have identified around 50 witnesses from whom they are gathering statements and are trawling through CCTV footage of the incident.   Related: Tell us: have you been affected by the Streatham attack?         Amman, from Harrow in north-west London, was jailed in December 2018 at the age of 18 after admitting to 13 counts of supporting Islamist terrorism and possessing and sharing Islamic State and al-Qaida propaganda in a family WhatsApp group and on social media. He was sentenced to three years and four months in jail, and served half that time in Belmarsh high security prison, taking in time he had already spent on remand. He had come to police attention in April of that year for posting extremist material and was arrested a month later. At his trial it emerged he had expressed support for Isis and its then leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and sent beheading videos to his girlfriend, advising her to kill her “kuffar” (unbelieving) parents. Amman also wrote about the desirability of conducting a terror attack: “If you can’t make a bomb because family, friends or spies are watching or suspecting you, take a knife, molotov, sound bombs or a car at night and attack.” Mark Lucraft, the trial judge, wrote in his sentencing remarks: “In terms of mindset, your interest in Islamic extremism and Daesh appears to be more than just an immature fascination. It seems to me on the material here that you are someone with sincerely held and concerning ideological beliefs,” before adding a warning that turned out to be prescient. “You speak about preferring a knife attack to the use of bombs and ask about having a knife delivered to her [his girlfriend’s] address”. Senior government officials believe the current law gives them no power to check if someone still poses a danger and to block their release at the halfway point of their sentence. But soon after this decision, he was assessed to be even more dangerous than first thought and surveillance officers were ordered to be armed, multiple sources said. The armed surveillance officers were carrying concealed pistols for their own personal protection and hence were able to stop Amman when he struck. After his conviction, acting Met Commander Alexis Boon, head of the Metropolitan police’s counter-terrorism command, said Amman had a “fascination with dying in the name of terrorism”, as seen in a notepad recovered from his home. “Amman had scrawled his ‘life goals’ in the notepad and top of the list, above family activities, was dying a martyr and going to ‘Jannah’, the afterlife,” she said."
91,terror,Northern Ireland police chief seeks 800 more officers as terror threat grows,"The head of the Police Service of Northern Ireland has asked for funding to recruit 800 officers to help deal with an increase in paramilitary activity in the region. Simon Byrne said the force had had to deal with more callouts and investigations of terrorist threats since he took up the role in July than his predecessor had faced in the previous year. “We can’t keep working at the pace we have done across the summer dealing with a rise of this kind of attack as well as day-to-day policing issues,” he said. He has spoken to the Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, about the need for more police. Byrne was speaking in Derry after a bomb was discovered this week in the Creggan area of the city. Journalist Lyra McKee was murdered in the same area in April while observing clashes between a dissident republican group, the New IRA. It was the second device found in less than a week after a mortar bomb was found near a police station in the nearby town of Strabane on Saturday. “I’ve been very clear that we need to grow the PSNI to that figure of 7,500 officers so that we can push more police officers to work with communities to get more information to deal not only with day-to-day crime but to continue the fight against paramilitaries and terrorism,” Byrne said. Police said on Saturday they were concerned with the number of devices left recklessly near residential and public areas. After the discovery in Strabane, Supt Gordon McCalmont said: “The key concern is … not just by the New IRA but other groupings, we are seeing devices left at bus stops in other parts of Northern Ireland and these devices left in vulnerable positions for extended periods of time with absolute disregard for the community – it is absolutely frightening.” Byrne said he was concerned that some more experienced terrorists were now involved with groups such as the New IRA, giving them an increased capability. “It is a worrying departure in terms of the determination, the tempo and the motivation of people to clearly kill or seriously injure one of our officers,” he said. “I am worried that the valiant efforts of officers cannot continue at this rate without support from the government to increase the number of people that I can deploy to communities to fight terrorism.”"
92,terror,Retired Australian baker loses appeal in Vietnam on controversial 'financing terrorism' charges,"A 70-year-old Australian man convicted in a controversial trial in Vietnam for anti-government terrorism offences has told a court he loves Vietnam and its people and was only ever a peaceful advocate for democratic reform. “I want Vietnam to progress and the people to enjoy freedom,” he said. But on Monday Chau Van Kham’s appeal was dismissed by a judge in Ho Chi Minh City who insisted his 12-year prison sentence be upheld. Chau, a retired baker from Sydney, will be 82 when he is released if he serves his full sentence for “financing terrorism”, which is related to his membership of a pro-democracy group, Viet Tan. His eldest son, Dennis, told the United Nations last month that his trial was a “charade”, and his sentence “effectively a death sentence”.   Related: Family of retired Sydney baker jailed in Vietnam say Australia needs to do more    In Chau’s single-day, judge-only trial, held simultaneously with four other people in November, he was tried and convicted and sentenced to 12 years jail, all within four hours. The court was effectively closed. It was open only for approved people and his family was excluded. On Monday the judge hearing his appeal said the original sentence would stand. Vietnam’s public security ministry has said Chau was convicted for holding a senior position in the New South Wales chapter of Viet Tan, for “financing terrorism” and for recruiting members. His two Vietnamese co-defendants, Nguyen Van Vien and Tran Van Quyen, also had their convictions upheld on appeal. Chau told the court he loved and respected Vietnam and was a member of a legal organisation committed to peaceful democratic reform. “I am a Vietnamese Australian, an Australian citizen, but I never forget that I am of Vietnamese origin,” he said. “I love Vietnam. I love my Vietnamese people. I want Vietnam to progress and the people to enjoy freedom. I wish for change and press for change.” He said he had no reason or desire to join a terrorist organisation and would never seek to harm any person. “I joined Viet Tan in 2010 because I believe in the peaceful policies of the organisation. In 2016 the Vietnamese government branded Viet Tan as a terrorist organisation while Viet Tan is properly registered and is a legal organisation in [the] USA and Australia. “I accept that I entered Vietnam using an ID not belonging to me [and that] was wrong. While in Vietnam I had not engaged in any act of violence or terrorist in nature.” The Australia director of Human Rights Watch, Elaine Pearson, said Chau and his co-accused had been sentenced to 10 or more years on terrorism charges even though they had not been implicated in any violence or terrorism. “They are the latest victims in a spiralling crackdown on dissent and free speech within Vietnam,” she said. “They are among hundreds of political prisoners who are currently detained. “There is no tolerance in Vietnam for anyone who calls for democracy or criticises the ruling Communist party.” Pearson said Chau’s case raised myriad due process concerns. “He was sentenced in a trial that involved multiple defendants yet was over in a few hours, suggesting the verdict was pre-determined,” she said. “He only met with his lawyer a handful of times. His consular meetings have been recorded and in the presence of Vietnamese government officials, meaning he can’t speak freely.” Pearson said while the Australian government had refrained from making public comments while legal processes were going on, there was no excuse now that his appeal was rejected. “On some occasions, Vietnam has allowed political prisoners to be released into exile in Europe or the US, but that will only happen if there is strong pressure from the Australian government,” she said. “It is critical that foreign [affairs] minister Marise Payne speaks up about the due process concerns in his case and urges his immediate release. “Chau Van Kham is 70 … Conditions inside Vietnam’s prisons make it even more important for him to be released sooner rather than later.” Chau, an Australian citizen, was born in Vietnam and served in the army of the republic of Vietnam before 1975. After the war he was sent to a re-education camp for three years, before he fled Vietnam by boat. He arrived in Australia in 1983. He worked as a baker fin Sydney for decades. He became a key Australian organiser for Viet Tan of pro-reform rallies and an outspoken advocate for democracy in Vietnam.   Related: Essex lorry deaths: Vietnam police charge seven over role in trafficking    In the 1980s Viet Tan had advocated to topple the communist government but in recent years it had explicitly “rejected the use of violence”. It said it was “convinced that nonviolent means are most effective for generating maximum civic participation … to contribute to Vietnam’s modernisation and reform”. The United Nations describes Viet Tan as “a peaceful organisation advocating for democratic reform”, but it was formally proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the Vietnamese government in 2016, which said it was “a reactionary and terrorist organisation, always silently carrying out activities against Vietnam”. Chau sought to return to Vietnam in 2019 to meet fellow pro-democracy advocates but was refused a visa. He chose to cross into Vietnam via a land border with Cambodia in January, carrying a false identity document. He was arrested after meeting a democracy activist who, it is believed, was under surveillance, along with Vietnamese nationals Nguyen Van Vien and Tran Van Quyen, who were sentenced to 11 and 10 years prison respectively. Chau was initially charged with participating in activities aimed at overthrowing the government, but in July this was downgraded to “terrorism to oppose the people’s government”."
93,terror,Brother of Manchester Arena bomber found guilty of murder,"The brother of the Manchester Arena bomber has been found guilty of the murder of 22 people and helping to plan one of the deadliest terror attacks the UK has ever seen. 
Hashem Abedi was not in court to hear the unanimous verdict after deciding earlier in the week to withdraw himself from the proceedings, sacking his entire defence team. 
As each victim’s name was read out the jury returned a guilty verdict, with family members becoming emotional and heard crying in the courtroom. 
Following the verdict, a counter-terrorism chief said the 22-year-old was driven by a “sick ideology” and would not have stopped his murderous activities until he was caught. 
DCS Simon Barraclough, the senior investigating officer on the night of the attack, said Abedi had shown “not one jot of emotion” or remorse throughout the trial. 
“He is a man who is equally responsible as his brother for this horrendous attack, this monstrous attack. The way he has conducted himself since he landed demonstrates even more the jihadi mindset that would be supportive of the sick ideology of IS [Islamic State],” he added. 
The suicide bombing, the worst terror attack on UK soil since the 7/7 attacks, was detonated by Abedi’s older brother, Salman, and Abedi had attempted to point the finger of blame at his dead sibling. 
However, it emerged that the defendant had stood shoulder to shoulder with his brother, acting as quartermaster, chauffeur and technician and sharing a common goal to kill and maim as many people as possible in the attack after an Ariana Grande concert. 
Speaking after the verdict, Paul Hett, whose son Martyn, 29, was murdered in the blast, thanked police, security services and the jury for bringing Abedi to justice.  
He said: “This verdict will not bring back the 22 victims murdered by Salman and Hashem Abedi. Nor will it … heal the wounds of the 264 people physically injured in the attack, many of whom with life-changing injuries. And this verdict will not help over 670 people who suffered psychological trauma after the attack, many still suffering today. 
“But what this verdict will do is give an overwhelming sense of justice to all those affected by this heinous crime.” 
Hashem Abedi, who was 19 at the time of the bombing, spent months working alongside his brother collecting ingredients and building prototype bombs. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
During the six-week trial, one of the biggest terror trials ever held on UK soil, the jury were told that the brothers began showing signs of radicalisation after their parents returned to Libya, planning the attack when they were living alone in their family home in south Manchester. 
Abedi, alongside his brother, acquired the ingredients – “precursor chemicals” – for the bomb by creating fictitious online accounts and using the bank details and Amazon accounts of unsuspecting friends and family. 
The brothers’ cover story was that they needed to refill a large electric battery at the family home in Libya that was used to power a generator. 
Meanwhile, Abedi, who had studied electrical installation, began collecting empty metal vegetable oil cans from a Stockport pizza takeaway he was working at under the guise that he would sell them for scrap. However, Abedi went on to use these containers to make a number of prototype improvised explosive devices. 
A month before the attack, the brothers, by now having built up a stockpile of chemicals at two addresses in south Manchester, would be forced to hurriedly move the bomb-making ingredients. 
On 6 April 2017, their parents, Ramadan and Samia, arrived in the UK for a brief visit and the brothers were told they would be returning to Libya on one-way tickets in a matter of days on plane tickets bought by their older sibling, Ismail. 
Given their impending departure and fearing that their plans were about to be foiled, the brothers could no longer use various addresses to store the materials for their explosives. 
Forty-eight hours before their departure, they made a late-night purchase of a white Nissan Micra. The car was subsequently parked at a car park near the siblings’ home, and they transferred chemicals and shrapnel to the car. Hours later, the pair departed for Libya with their parents. 
Four days before the attack, Salman returned to Manchester alone. “All Salman needed to do was collect what he needed from the Micra … source some parts necessary to make the bomb viable, and find somewhere suitable both to construct it and to detonate it,” said the prosecutor, Duncan Penny. 
CCTV footage showed him methodically making the final preparations for the attack, carrying out a number of reconnaissance missions to the music venue, where he would eventually detonate his lethal home-made bomb.  
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
Minutes before the blast, according to Libyan authorities, Abedi phoned his mother and younger brother in Tripoli. The purpose of the call, according to one official, was to ask forgiveness for what he was about to do. 
Stills from the night showed 22-year-old carrying a rucksack and silently watching and waiting in the City Room – an assembly point for concertgoers and their families – for an hour before eventually detonating his device. 
The explosive packed with screws and bolts for shrapnel detonated at the exact moment when thousands of men, women and children streamed out at the end of the concert shortly after 10.30pm on 22 May 2017. 
Of the 22 casualties, 19 died at the scene and three more were treated by members of the public and the emergency services but later died. Police went on to identify nearly 1,000 victims of the attack, including 28 people who were very seriously injured, 111 others who were treated in hospital and 670 who have reported psychological trauma. 
The day after the bombing, Abedi was arrested in Libya alongside his father, Ramadan, who was released without charge. It would take more than two years for British diplomats to secure his extradition. 
Abedi maintained he had nothing to do with making the bomb and had “no inkling” of his brother’s radicalisation. 
His fingerprints and DNA were found on a number of significant items, including pieces of metal tightly rolled into improvised cylinders and a rented flat where traces of a homemade explosive were discovered. Phone records also linked him to the atrocity. 
Sir Richard Leese, the leader of Manchester city council, said the bombing had shocked the city but that there had been a “remarkable spirit of solidarity” and the city stood together refusing to give in to terrorists who want to stoke hatred and division.“I hope the fact that one of those behind this callous attack has been brought to justice will provide some measure of comfort to all those affected,” he said.Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, of Greater Manchester police, said: “Although he was in Libya at the time of the attack, Hashem Abedi is every bit as guilty as his dead brother and this is reflected in the judgment we see today.” 
He added: “In the last few weeks Abedi absented himself from court, such was the contempt he showed for the proceedings and all those so deeply affected by this cowardly act.We are very pleased at this verdict.” 
Abedi will be sentenced at a later date for 22 counts of murder, one of attempted murder encompassing the injured survivors, and conspiring with his brother to cause explosions."
94,terror,Government to be challenged in court over Prevent reviewer,"The government’s failure to appoint an independent reviewer of its Prevent strategy and assess the controversial de-radicalisation programme’s effectiveness is to be challenged in court. The decision by Rights Watch (UK) to initiate legal action against the Home Office comes amid terror attacks in London that raise questions about whether young men can be successfully directed away from terrorist violence. Under the terms of the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019, a report by an independent review of Prevent must be presented to parliament by mid-August. Lord Carlile QC was appointed to conduct the review but stood down in December following objections over his previous strong support for the programme. No one has been chosen to replace him. Rights Watch (UK) fears any new selection process will allow time only for a cursory review of the controversial programme and not be a rigorous examination of its aims or procedures. Prevent has become a toxic brand for many within the Muslim community. By delaying the review, Rights Watch (UK) fears, the Home Office may be running down the clock so that it only delivers a “whitewash”. Counter-terrorism police have placed the non-violent group Extinction Rebellion (XR) on a list of extremist ideologies that should be reported to the authorities running Prevent, raising further concerns about the focus of the programme. The overwhelming majority of those referred to Prevent end up being dealt with by other agencies. Last year more of those given specialist support in what is known as the “channel” process were suspected of far-right radicalisation – involving 254 cases – than those suspected of Islamist radicalisation – 210 cases. The stated aim of Prevent, which is a voluntary programme, is to divert people from terrorism before they offend. It deals with individuals who have yet to cross the criminality threshold. Yasmine Ahmed, the director of Rights Watch, said “Prevent has involved a massively disproportionate number of people from Muslim communities.” Part of the problem, she added, was because “the government has an incredibly vague definition of extremism which allows the government to catch a whole range of people who may be legitimately questioning government policy. “There are a range of different de-radicalisation projects elsewhere, such as the Aarhaus model in Denmark that are more developed. We should look at how other countries are dealing with this.” A letter before court action has been sent to the Home Office by Leigh Day, lawyers acting for Rights Watch (UK), which declares: “Parliament envisaged that the independent review would involve consultation with affected individuals and communities, as well as with the various civil society groups and organisations involved in the debate concerning the Prevent Strategy. “It also envisaged a thorough and effective review of Prevent … and the concerns expressed about it. The delayed appointment of the independent reviewer reduces the likelihood that that will occur either at all, or with sufficient rigour.” In response to an urgent parliamentary question last month by Diane Abbott, Labour’s home affairs spokesperson, the security minister, Brandon Lewis, said: “The statutory deadline for the review to be completed and its findings shared remains 12 August 2020. The next steps are being considered right now and will be announced in due course.” The Home Office confirmed it had received the letter from Rights Watch (UK) and will respond."
95,terror,First Lenin statue in western Germany to be erected after heated battle,"A statue of Vladimir Lenin is soon to be erected in the German city of Gelsenkirchen following a longstanding battle between a leftist party and city authorities. Gelsenkirchen, in the centre of the Ruhr valley, once Germany’s industrial heartland, will be the first western German city with a statue of the founder of the Russian communist party. While statues of Lenin once graced squares of the towns and municipalities across the communist east, the GDR, it is thought none has ever been erected in a public space in western Germany. A court has now given permission for the Marxist-Leninist party of Germany, the MLPD, to place the metal statue outside its headquarters. The city authorities had tried to stop the statue, ordering a halt to the building of a concrete pedestal on which it is due to stand. It argues that the statue will “disturb the view” of a neighbouring listed building, a 1930s building society branch. The statue’s presence, it said, would also contravene historical monument preservation rules. It would, the city argued, “mean that the view of the observer of the historic building would no longer be unrestricted”. The local council for the district of West Gelsenkirchen said Lenin was an inappropriate figure to be commemorated in the city. “The communist leader Lenin is representative of violence, suppression, terror and immense human suffering. All this makes him incompatible with the free democratic constitutional order in Germany, and means he is a symbol of the fight against and the abolition of our democracy,” it said in a statement. But the MLPD, which owns the building society, fought the restrictions and called the court’s decision to let it go ahead and erect the statue, “a fantastic victory for Vladimir Ilyich Lenin”.   Related: 1919: Lenin agrees to Guardian interview    The MLPD’s head, Gabi Fechtner, told German media: “We are really happy. Gelsenkirchen is a workers’ city and Lenin fits in here very well.” A city spokesman said that the city authorities “will be contending the court’s judgment”. The statue – in which Lenin holds out his right arm – is due to be unveiled on 14 March in a ceremony that is expected to attract leftist supporters from across the country. The MLPD had been at pains to erect it ahead of the 150th anniversary of Lenin’s birth, on 22 April. The cast-iron 2.15 metre effigy was made in the 1930s in the Soviet Union. It was acquired by the MLPD from a city in the Czech Republic for an undisclosed fee, following an online auction. The MLPD was founded in 1982 and is under observation by German intelligence, which considers it extremist and unconstitutional."
96,terror,Censoring ‘dangerous’ ideas is itself dangerous,"A Friends of Palestine society banned from staging a street theatre performance called “Mock Checkpoint”. A student member of a Kurdish society barred by her Oxford college from chairing an event on Kurdish struggles. A Glasgow School of Art MA exhibition censored. These are just some of the bans imposed by universities in recent years under the government’s anti-terror Prevent guidelines. According to the Office for Students, 2,153 events or speakers had restrictions placed on them by universities because of Prevent, in 2017-18; 53 were banned. The impact of Prevent, Soas’ Prof Alison Scott-Baumann observes, is not to counter terrorism but to create “a situation where thought becomes dangerous”. There has been much discussion recently about censorship in universities, with the launch of Toby Young’s Free Speech Union and the “no-platforming” of the historian Selina Todd and former Tory home secretary Amber Rudd at Oxford colleges.     The historian Selina Todd Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian    Critics point out that Prevent imposes far greater restrictions on free speech than student societies but is largely ignored by the likes of Young. That’s true. But that’s no argument for dismissing campaigns for free speech. The more we accept that speakers should be no-platformed because of their views, the less we will be able to challenge the kinds of censorship imposed through government programmes such as Prevent. So, yes, let’s call out the hypocrisy of those who campaign for free speech but ignore the most egregious acts of censorship. Let’s equally call out the hypocrisy of those who would highlight the chilling effects of Prevent but are willing to no-platform speakers whose views they deplore. Censoring thought because it is “dangerous” should be challenged whoever is the censor. • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist"
97,terror,Richard Jewell review – Clint Eastwood’s cautionary tale for cynical times,"There is an elegant, even-handed character study buried within Clint Eastwood’s crisp procedural about a security guard who becomes a hero – and then a pariah – after reporting a suspicious package at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser, who plays Jewell as deeply flawed but still sympathetic) is an overweight 33-year-old loner who lives with his mother, Bobi (Kathy Bates). He believes in protecting people and sees himself as a diligent member of law enforcement.  So it’s a shock when the FBI accuses him of having planted the bomb and, worse still, when minxy and unscrupulous local journalist Kathy Scruggs (Olivia Wilde, hindered by thin, sexist characterisation) creates a national media circus by writing about him. Cool-headed attorney Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell) is called in to teach Jewell a lesson about trusting the authorities. “Why do you keep defending these people?” Bobi asks her son. “I’m not defending, I’m explaining,” he replies, knee-capped by his own beliefs. Equally resonant is Eastwood’s take on the public lambasting of false heroes, as well as the fickle and arbitrary nature of fame.           Watch a trailer for Richard Jewell. "
98,terror,UK venues could face legal duty to provide protection from terrorism,"The owners and operators of businesses and public spaces such as concert halls, shopping centres and parks will be legally bound to protect such venues from terrorism under a new statutory duty proposed by the government. The so-called “protect duty” reflects proposals put forward by the family of Martyn Hett, who was killed in the Manchester Arena bombing attack in 2017. Home Office officials are to launch a consultation on legally forcing organisations to increase physical security at venues and train staff to respond to terrorist attacks, as well as putting in place incident response plans – and how failure to comply would be enforced. While the move is likely to receive the backing from relatives of the victims of terrorist attacks, critics raised concerns the plan had echoes of the controversial Prevent duty that requires public sector workers to report concerns about extremism to the police. Figen Murray, the mother of Hett, 29, who was one of 22 killed when radical Islamist Salman Abedi detonated a homemade bomb at the end of an Ariana Grande concert, has been lobbying the government to bring in anti-terrorism security measures under a “Martyn’s law”.     Martyn Hett, who was killed in the Manchester Arena attack. Photograph: Martyn Hett    The security minister, James Brokenshire, said: “Our first priority is keeping the public safe and preventing more families from suffering the heartbreak of losing a loved one. “The devastating attacks in 2017, and more recently at Fishmongers’ Hall and Streatham, are stark reminders of the current threat we face. We are in complete agreement with campaigners such as Figen Murray on the importance of venues and public spaces having effective and proportionate protective security and preparedness measures to keep people safe. “Of course, it is important that this new law is proportionate. This public consultation will ensure we put in place a law that will help protect the public while not putting undue pressure on businesses.” It is understood the Home Office does not expect small businesses and smaller venues to be subject to the plan, rather it would focus on larger spaces. The public consultation will launch in spring and will seek views from a range of organisations including businesses, public authorities, the security industry and campaign groups. The Home Office will seek views on the proportionality and scope of the duty, and how it should be enforced. There are currently no specific proposals on how operators of venues and businesses would be penalised if they failed to comply. Nick Thomas-Symonds, Labour’s shadow security minister, responding to the government plans, saying: “There can be no objection to proper consultation on a duty to protect and we pay tribute to those who have campaigned for this change. “However, a duty to protect is no substitute for professional policing. Combating the terrorists requires everything from community policing through to counter-terrorism. “Unfortunately, successive Tory governments axed police numbers and the current government does not have plans to fully restore them any time soon.” Matt Maer, director of security and resilience for the Canary Wharf Group, the owner and developer of nearly 100 acres of property in east London and elsewhere in the capital, backed the initiative. He said: “This legislation has the potential to make a significant impact on public security, improving the situation for people as they go about their daily lives.” Prevent is one of the most controversial aspects of the government’s counter-terrorism strategy. Introduced in 2015, it requires employees of public bodies, including schools, NHS trusts and councils, to report concerns about individuals feared to be at risk of being drawn into terrorism. Critics have argued the duty places teachers, doctors and social workers under huge pressure, resulting in people being referred to the police for minor, innocent infractions, and that minority communities, in particular Muslims, have been disproportionately affected. Counter-terrorism officials insist the Prevent strategy in its current form is the best way to reduce the risk of terrorism.  Clare Collier, advocacy director of the human rights group Liberty, said: “Yet again this government is shirking responsibility for its failures. This is an admission that after 10 years in power they haven’t been able to address the problem and are now asking someone else to have a go. “The government’s counter-terrorism strategy has only served to propagate discriminatory attitudes and handing that strategy over to private companies will see those attitudes deepen. This new legislation is likely to have the same impact as Prevent – creating suspicion, causing division and further marginalisation of targeted communities.” The government has pledged to restore 20,000 police officers and has committed to increase counter-terrorism policing funding by £90m. The Home Office rejects the idea that the protect duty proposals will discriminate and says it will ensure consistency across industry, with many organisations already putting in place what has been proposed."

100,terror,Domestic violence kills 15 times as many as terrorism in Britain,"Domestic violence kills 15 times as many people in Britain as terrorism, say campaigners who want the police to be given more money to tackle the problem. The huge disparity is highlighted in figures obtained from official sources by victims’ rights campaigners, who say the police budget for combating domestic violence must be ringfenced, as it is for terrorism. Official figures show there were 1,870 domestic murders in England and Wales between 2000 and 2018, compared with 126 that were terrorism-related. The vast majority of domestic murder victims were women. In addition, campaigners say an estimated 400 victims of domestic violence a year take their own lives. “Expenditure on the prevention and detection of domestic violence must be hugely increased now,” said Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru’s home affairs spokeswoman. “It is shocking and a disgrace that since 2000 over 6,000 – predominantly women – have either been murdered or have taken their own lives following domestic abuse.” Police forces do not reveal how much they spend on tackling domestic violence. But campaigners say it has been cut in recent years. The intelligence and security agencies, charged with combating terrorism have an annual budget of £2.6bn. “Spending on fighting terrorism has been ringfenced whilst money for women’s support services and for the police has been cut,” said Saville Roberts. “Fifteen times more [people] have been murdered by partners than have lost their lives because of terrorism. It is right that funds for counter terrorism are not cut, but the budget for domestic abuse must increase and be protected as a matter of priority for the next government.” The call comes amid mounting concern that domestic violence is increasing. Demand for women’s abuse support services rose by 83% in the 10 years up to 2017 while funding fell by almost 50%. The government estimates that domestic violence costs the UK £66bn annually. On average the police receive an emergency call relating to domestic abuse every 30 seconds. Domestic abuse offences in London rose by 63% between 2011 and 2018, according to figures collated by the mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime. At the same time, prosecutions are falling. Domestic-abuse related cases referred to prosecutors for consideration for charge fell 11% last year despite a surge in the number of crimes recorded by police. Thousands of alleged perpetrators remain at large, according to campaigners. “Police funding and support services for victims of domestic abuse have been severely cut since 2010,” said Harry Fletcher, spokesman for the Victims Rights Campaign. “Over the last 18 years 126 people have been killed by terror in England and Wales whilst over 1,800 mainly women have been killed by partners. This is outrageous. “It is essential that the new government gives priority to preventing and investigating domestic abuse. Budgets must be protected and ringfenced in the future. The police must be given the resources to find and prosecute the thousands of alleged perpetrators who are at large in the community on the police wanted list.”"
101,terror,"Isis starting to reassert itself in Middle East heartlands, UN warns"," Islamic State has begun to reassert itself in its heartlands in the Middle East and continues to seek opportunities to strike in the west, the United Nations has said. A report to the UN security council based on recent intelligence from member states describes how the group is mounting increasingly bold insurgent attacks in Iraq and Syria, calling and planning for the breakout of its fighters from detention facilities and exploiting the weaknesses of local security forces. The report portrays an organisation that has suffered significant setbacks but is tenacious, well-funded and still poses a considerable local and international threat. Though Donald Trump said Isis had been “largely defeated”, the claim has been repeatedly questioned by analysts, allies and some senior US officials. A Pentagon report warned of a resurgence in August, before the killing by US special forces of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the self-declared caliph and former leader of Isis, in October.   Related: Isis founding member confirmed by spies as group's new leader    The new leader of Isis is believed to be Amir Mohammed Abdul Rahman al-Mawli al-Salbi, who is also known as Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Quraishi. He is one of the group’s founding members and led the enslavement of Iraq’s Yazidi minority and oversaw operations around the globe. The UN report says the general strategic direction of Isis is unlikely to change but the new leader’s Turkmen ethnicity suggests he may be only a temporary choice until the group finds a more legitimate “emir”, potentially a direct descendant from the Quraysh Hashemite tribe who could command the full support of more remote “provinces” or affiliates of the group. One challenge for Isis will be to rally supporters behind the new leader if security concerns prevent any direct communication. The group does not lack funds, the report says. In Iraq it continues to finance its operations by investing in legitimate businesses and commercial fronts, and in Syria it has resumed extortion operations during daylight hours. Such efforts raise sufficient resources to cover the group’s running costs and allow pensions to be paid to widows or orphans of dead fighters. The issue of foreign fighters remains acute, the UN notes, with between half and two-thirds of the more than 40,000 who joined the “caliphate” from overseas still alive. There are grave concerns about detention centres and camps in Syria set up to house members of the group and their families who fled its last redoubts. Al-Hol camp, controlled by Syrian Kurdish forces, contains more than 70,000 people living in appalling conditions. “The current improvised holding arrangements are a recipe for radicalisation and despair, especially in the case of minors … Repatriation of these people to their states of origin and/or nationality will be challenging in the short term but holds out the greatest hope of mitigating the longer-term threat,” the report says. Many analysts predicted Isis would return to a low-level insurgency after losing the vast territory of its so-called caliphate in 2017, and would frame its heavy defeat as a temporary setback. Last year Isis suffered further setbacks in Afghanistan, where thousands of its fighters have been killed by the Taliban, and Libya, where only a couple of hundred of loyal militants remain. The group remains too weak to pose a significant direct threat to Europe, where it remains reliant on attacks by “homegrown terrorists”. These tend to be unreliable and relatively low-impact, the report says."
102,terror,Counter-terror chief Basu speaks truth to power on social inclusion,"Two articles in Wednesday’s Guardian highlighted the problems of disaffected young people. Neil Basu (Greater social inclusion vital to fight extremism, says counter-terror chief, 7 August) talked of the common themes that characterise the more “malleable”: high anxiety, lack of confidence, education etc. In your Society section (‘If I hadn’t come here I would be in a jail cell’, 7 August), a young man tells how he was transformed from a “naughty, obnoxious teenager” into a widely respected leader of activities by being involved in a community farm in south Wales. The project is facing a £200,000 subsidy cut because the local authority cannot afford to fund it any longer. Many similar projects face similar problems and the threat of closure; they are probably more effective in turning young people’s lives around than 20,000 extra police on the streets. I was involved in a very successful project to teach disaffected (male) teenagers to ride horses. The outcome was a group whose self-esteem and general behaviour improved greatly. These mainly urban projects should be encouraged and properly supported by the government if they have any interest in helping vulnerable young people. Alison HarrisHarrogate, North Yorkshire • Huge praise to assistant commissioner Neil Basu, senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism, for his intelligent assessment of the sources of, and solutions to, home-grown terrorism. It is refreshing to hear such a senior public servant asserting that “more social inclusion, more social mobility and more education” are more powerful than “all the policing and state security apparatus put together” and that people need a stake and a voice in their society. This is not just in combating terrorism (or crime generally), but in low educational attainment, obesity, some mental illnesses and life satisfaction we need more of these things. This requires political will, investment, staffing, reduction in inequalities, progressive taxation and less family poverty. We await other senior figures coming out to admit that their services “are dealing with the symptoms and we need to deal with the root causes”. Speaking truth to power does not have a good record but shouted out loud on many fronts by high-profile figures might just get through. Either that, or wait for the disciplining and gagging of Assistant Commissioner Basu as a warning to others who might follow his example.Prof Carl ParsonsLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

103,terror,I used to stockpile for the nuclear apocalypse. Where did my youthful terror go?,"As Extinction Rebellion flooded Whitehall with rivers of fake blood this month, and its youthful members conspired to gridlock nationwide traffic, I was reminded again of a half-term holiday in Cumbria in 1984 when I made and consumed a lot of packet soup. It was the powdered variety of Knorr’s Farmhouse Vegetable, which looked like wallpaper paste with carrot flecks and bullets of salty starch laughably called “croutons”. Yet the preparing of this soup, the stirring, the simmering and the drinking, gave me a small, temporary sense of comfort because, aged 11, all day and all night, I worried about nuclear bombs. Or not so much the bombs themselves, but the terrifying end-of-days carnage that would follow, that I’d heard talk of on Panorama or via CND leaflets. I fixated on the matter of saving my cats, Soot and Fred, while the Dents crouched under the kitchen table. Should I put the cats in a cardboard box? What if the bomb scared them away? Would it be safe to go out and look? I cried alone at night, worrying how I could possibly be strong enough to dig a hole to bury my mother when she inevitably died, gasping, of radiation sickness. I fretted especially about what I would eat once the shops had been looted, the factories and fields decimated, leaving me the sole survivor, tasked with saving the universe. This was why I was secretly stockpiling packets of Knorr soup in a shoebox under my bed, rebelling against my own extinction. And although, 34 years later, I am still very much here, for this reason I find it hard to be vexed by the scared young people blocking bridges and lying prostrate on motorways. At a TV studio recently, one starry type, who I will leave anonymous, huffed into makeup demanding I vacate my interview slot so that she could go first, as it had taken her three hours to cross London. “It’s taken us all three hours, babes. No one is personally targeting you. Buy some trainers and walk if the road is blocked,” I snapped, as the runner attempted to do the green room equivalent of putting a tea towel over my parrot cage to quieten me. Extinction Rebellion may be, to some of us, annoying little shits, but they do it on our behalf – and this problem is real. I find Greta Thunberg’s stiff, hollow-eyed and terrified expression painful, as it is borne of a lot of lost sleep. It is the exact same expression I wore as I stirred that soup, full of visions of the end of the world. Each youthful sort seriously ballsing up your mini-break has their own Room 101 of nightmares; of drowning parents, of water-bloated corpses, of airborne viruses, and how they’ll keep their own cats dry when a large downpour finally washes away Cornwall. Importantly, only youthful types feel so passionately that all of these things go against what is right. My personal terror over nuclear war dissipated as I grew older and more accustomed to the wider truth: that existential dread comes in many, many flavours, and the pure fact is that every one of us will die of something crap eventually – so hey, better just make the best of things, eh? Perhaps you feel like me – as you push plastic cartons into the recycling, knowing they cannot be recycled – and still hope for the best. You know the planet is getting hotter, but on the upside Margate was lovely in late September.   Related: Today’s demisexual kids are swimming against the tide of hookup culture. Good luck to them    So I thank the youth for their passion, their fury, because my genre of middle-aged gloomy stoicism is no use at all when it comes to any sort of world-saving venture. No one needs me on an Extinction Rebellion march platform saying things like: “Well, sure, global heating is bad, I’m with you on that, but to be quite honest I’ve seen what dying slowly of Alzheimer’s or cancer is like, and one big flood out of nowhere seems like a good deal to me.” Or, “Look, I used to worry about nuclear war, but that sort of went out of fashion. Just like horror about the environment might, too, because there is usually a diverting new terror just around the corner.” I no longer worry much about the end of the world; instead, I live every day for the tiny moments of joy that buffer the inevitable. We are all dying – could be next week, could be in 20 years, could be later. It struck me recently, after a decade of caring for my parents, that I am most likely to die aged 85+, plodding endlessly between a dozen contradictory doctor’s appointments, or waiting for a letter for a test; not in a bang or a flash, but waiting to have blood taken, reading an old copy of Closer. This week, I lived for the small joys of meeting a nice waggy dog in a pub, which fell into my arms pathetically; a slow-cooker pasta puttanesca sauce; laughing with my brother on WhatsApp about old rave tunes; and booking a ticket to see Judy with Renée Zellweger. I did not eat any packet soup or worry overly about the environment. It’s the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine."
104,terror,The Need by Helen Phillips review – the terror of the home invasion,"When women entered the workforce en masse in the 1980s, sociologist Arlie Hochschild called it the “second shift”. Women’s lives were transformed, she found, but the men they shared their homes with were stubbornly unchanging in their habits. So, as men were clocking off and chilling out, their wives and girlfriends were clocking back in for an evening of domestic duty: the cooking and the cleaning, the laundry and the to-do lists, the shopping and the shuttling between childminder and swimming classes. The situation remains the same today. In effect, women in employment are pulling double shifts, and their unpaid labour is subsidising the men who live with them – or rather, live off them. Molly, the American suburban mother at the centre of Helen Phillips’s novel, hasn’t read Hochschild, but then she doesn’t have time. She’s got a small daughter called Viv and a baby called Ben; a job as a palaeobotanist at a site called the Pit, which turns up plant fossils mystifyingly not quite like anything else in the record; a ceaseless rota of expressing milk so she can keep up the breastfeeds; and a husband whose work takes him away from home for weeks at a time. She is tired – so tired, and so anxious for her children’s safety that she can hardly trust her own senses. She suffers “minor disorientations … small errors of eyes and ears … The conviction that there was something somehow off about a piece of litter found amid the fossils in the Pit at work.” When we meet her, Molly is cowering in her bedroom with her children, certain that there is an intruder in the house, and simultaneously certain that she’s in the grip of one of her delusions. From the first page, Phillips is writing in several registers of horror at the same time: it’s a juggling act as awe-inspiring as watching a harassed mother pump milk while answering work emails while responding to a nagging toddler. The terror of the home invasion is perfectly vivid, and so is the disturbing prospect that we’re embedded in the consciousness of a woman who is dangerously split off from reality. Phillips can conjure pure nightmare in a single sentence as she narrates Molly’s thought processes: “Her desperation for her children’s silence manifested as a suffocating force, the desire for a pillow, a thick pair of socks, anything she could shove into them to perfect their muteness and save their lives.” It’s a line that chills not just through the violence it implies, but also because of the proximity of annihilation to love.     Helen Phillips Photograph: PR    Yet Molly, we soon learn, is right to believe there’s something trespassing in her house. The thing she’s hiding from turns out to be at once totally sinister and entirely familiar: both an answer to the ravening demands of her family, and something with frightening needs of its own. She’s right, too, about the trash she’s found in the Pit, which attracts coachloads of curious tourists when it is put on display. There’s a Coke bottle with the script of the logo leaning left rather than right; a toy soldier with an undeniable monkey tail; and most compelling of all, a Bible where the “divine pronoun” is She rather than He throughout. These are objects that are not quite evil but definitely creepy, and Phillips revels in the ambivalence of her imagination: in genre terms, The Need belongs to the HP Lovecraft-revisiting tradition of the New Weird, where incomprehensible phenomena lead into the realms of the terrible and sublime. Like short-story writers Kristen Roupenian in You Know You Want This and Mariana Enríquez in Things We Lost in the Fire, Phillips revitalises horror tropes by running them through a female point of view. There’s beauty, too: Molly feels her dread casts “the light of the sacred upon the mundane”, and Phillips’s attentive, unsentimental observations of Molly’s threatened domesticity catch at the heart. Thrillingly disturbing, frighteningly insightful about motherhood and love, and spilling over with offhand invention, The Need is one of this year’s most necessary novels. • The Need is published by Chatto &amp; Windus (£16.99).

105,terror,Eminem faces backlash after comparing himself to Manchester Arena bomber,"Eminem has been criticised after comparing himself to the Manchester Arena suicide bomber. His track Unaccommodating, taken from his new album Music to Be Murdered By, includes controversial lyrics that appear to make light of the 2017 terror attack. Twenty-two people were murdered as they left an Ariana Grande concert after Salman Abedi detonated a bomb in the foyer of the music venue. In the track, the star raps: “But I’m contemplating yelling ‘bombs away’ on the game / Like I’m outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting.” Hours after its release, the musician faced a backlash on social media. Figen Murray, whose 29-year-old son Martyn Hett died in the attack, called the song “pointless”. “Feels like he is piggybacking on the fame of Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber and says distasteful things about other celebrities,” she wrote on Twitter. “Not clever. Totally pointless. And before all Eminem fans pounce on me, I am not interested and will not engage.” Murray has campaigned for the introduction of Martyn’s Law, which would require venues to introduce more stringent security checks. Elkan Abrahamson, a solicitor for several of the bereaved families, said: “Eminem is a traitor to his talent; this is disrespectful, unwarranted and needlessly cruel.”  Others agreed, with many Twitter users saying they were disgusted by the lyrics and that it was “a pathetic attempt to get attention”. “I am disgusted how did he or his team think this was okay? He’s trash,” one user wrote. Another said: “The fact that Eminem made a joke about the Manchester attack in his song makes me sick. He can’t get out of this one. He fully said her name and can’t deny it at all. Disgusting. How insensitive do you have to be to say something like this.” One user called on the rapper to show some respect to those who had died and been injured: “This is so messed up! Many people (mostly children) were injured at this concert and some even lost their lives, and he thinks it’s OK to put this lyric in a song? @Eminem maybe try and have a little respect, and don’t use a terrorist attack to gain clout.” The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said: “This is unnecessarily hurtful and deeply disrespectful to the families and all those affected.”  It is the second time the rapper has referenced the Manchester arena bombing in his lyrics. In a 2018 freestyle battle rap, with a spoken caveat at the beginning that “nothing’s off limits” to get a reaction from the crowd, he rapped:  “Squashed in between a brainwashing machine Like an Islamic regime, a jihadist extreme radical Suicide bomber that’s seeing Ariana Grande sing her last song of the evening And as the audience from the damn concert is leaving Detonates the device strapped to his abdominal region I’m not gonna finish that, for obvious reasons”  Elsewhere in Unaccommodating, he compares himself to Saddam Hussein and Ayatollah Khomeini, and also references the September 11 attacks. The album is the musician’s 11th full-length release, and his third album in three years. It features guest stars including Ed Sheeran, Q-Tip and late rapper Juice WRLD, who died aged 21 in December."
106,terror,"Saudi Arabia using secret court to silence dissent, Amnesty finds","Saudi Arabia is using a secretive special court set up for terrorism-related cases to systematically prosecute human rights activists and other dissenting voices who defy the country’s absolute monarchy, a new report has found. The human rights watchdog Amnesty International spent five years investigating 95 cases heard at the Specialised Criminal court (SCC) in Riyadh, concluding in a report published on Thursday that the court is routinely used as a weapon to silence criticism despite the kingdom’s recent attempts to cultivate a reformist image. Since 2011, overly broad counter-terror and anti-cybercrime laws have been used by the SCC in unfair trials to hand down prison sentences of up to 30 years and in some cases the death penalty to human rights defenders, writers, economists, journalists, religious clerics, reformists and political activists, particularly from the country’s Shia minority, Amnesty said. “Every stage of the SCC’s judicial process is tainted with human rights abuses, from the denial of access to a lawyer, to incommunicado detention, to convictions based solely on so-called confessions extracted through torture,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty’s Middle East and North Africa regional director.     Loujain al-Hathloul was detained after campaigning for women’s right to drive. Photograph: Loujain al-Hathloul    Saudi Arabia has embarked on a series of wide-reaching social reforms since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was appointed heir to the throne in 2017, allowing women to drive, curbing the powers of the country’s notorious morality police and granting women the freedom to travel without the permission of a male guardian. The reforms, however, have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, including the detention of high-profile activists such as Loujain al-Hathloul, who campaigned for women’s right to drive. Saudi Arabia’s human rights record has also faced renewed international scrutiny since the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate in 2018.   Related: Khashoggi’s ‘killers’ have been sentenced to death. That won’t detoxify Saudi Arabia | Simon Tisdall    The SCC was established in 2008 to try individuals accused of crimes related to membership and support of al-Qaida. However, citing court documents, government statements and national legislation, as well as interviews with activists, lawyers and individuals close to the cases documented, Amnesty alleges that the court has morphed into a “mockery of justice” that targets freedom of speech and peaceful political activity. One of the most disturbing findings shows that the SCC is heavily reliant on confessions extracted under torture conditions. At least 20 people have been sentenced to death, 17 of whom have been executed. Hussein al-Rabi, a defendant in a mass trial of protesters from Saudi Arabia’s restive Shia-majority Qatif province, was executed in 2019 despite telling the court that his interrogator had hit him and threatened hanging and electric shocks unless he confessed. Rabi refused to do so, so the interrogator denied him food and water, leading to his hospitalisation.   Related: Saudi teenager could face execution for joining protests as child    “The presumption of innocence is not part of the Saudi Arabian judicial system,” said Taha al-Hajji, a lawyer who has represented many defendants before the SCC. In response to Amnesty’s investigation, Saudi Arabia’s official human rights commission offered a summary of the relevant laws and court procedures but failed to address any of the individual cases raised."
107,terror,"Westminster shooting: police killed suspect who had knives, says Met","An investigation into the shooting of a man in Whitehall is examining his health records as it tries to establish why he might have allegedly been carrying two knives. The man was shot dead on Sunday evening and the Metropolitan police said the incident was not being treated as terrorism, after an assessment by their counter-terrorism command. The Met said the man was acting suspiciously when officers came across him and challenged him just before 11.30pm on Sunday. On Monday morning, it emerged that officers from two forces were involved – the Met, which covers almost all of London, and the City of London police, who cover the capital’s financial district and whose firearms officers will attend incidents in the Met’s area if they can get there first. The Met said: “Officers challenged the man, who produced two knives.” It is understand he was first fired upon with an electric stun gun. Officers present believed the man still presented a threat to the lives of themselves or others, and he was shot by a firearms officer. The man later died from gunshot wounds. The Met said the incident happened in Great Scotland Yard, an area at the northern end of Whitehall, which is full of government and official buildings, and close to Trafalgar Square.  The force tweeted: “A man has been shot dead by officers following an incident in #Westminster at 23.27hrs on Sunday 8 March. This is NOT being treated as a terrorist incident.” The man was declared dead at the scene a short time later after attempts to save his life failed. Police firearms officers are trained to give first aid after they have opened fire. The Met said no police officers or members of the public were injured. Under the law in England and Wales, any shooting by the police has to be independently investigated by the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). In a statement, the IOPC said the incident involved officers from the Met and City of London forces: “At this early stage it is believed a man has been fatally shot during the police response to reports of a man carrying knives and acting suspiciously. Our thoughts and sympathies are with all of those affected by this terrible incident.“It is mandatory for us to conduct an independent investigation when the police fatally shoot a member of the public. We have established protocols with the police to ensure our investigations do not hinder their ability to conduct inquiries as part of their related investigations.” The IOPC investigation continues. The officers involved, having given a short initial account after the incident, will give a full account within 48 hours."
108,terror,"PM’s plan for terrorists could be ‘counter-productive’, says father of London Bridge attack victim","David Merritt felt heavy with grief when news of the Streatham terrorist attack broke, but he wasn’t shocked. The father of Jack Merritt, a 25-year old prison rehabilitation worker who was killed in the London Bridge terror attack in November, has warned that “the government is failing to do its job to keep the public safe” and that the prime minister’s plans to force through emergency terrorist sentencing is “a hasty measure” that “could be counter-productive.” Last week, the government announced plans to rush through emergency legislation that would prevent the release of terrorist offenders without parole board-risk assessments. Alex Carlile, the UK’s former reviewer of terror legislation, cast doubt on whether changes could be made retrospectively to the sentences of up to 224 terrorist offenders currently in prison. Ministers expect a legal challenge. Speaking to the Observer, Merritt was wearied but unsurprised by the government’s “panicky response” and described it as “the austerity chickens coming home to roost”. Just as his son had “devoted his energy to the purpose of prisoner rehabilitation”, Merritt called for urgent and proper funding into prison services to prevent further attacks. “Keeping people in prison for longer in itself doesn’t keep anybody safe,” he said. “It just means [the government] is kicking the can further down the road: spewing people out further down the line when they’ve been associating with other people of like minds, convincing each other of their radicalisation, that’s obviously not a good thing unless they have received real help to change their ways and there are effective deradicalisation programmes. As it is, from the reports of most prisons, we already know prisoners are locked up for 23 hours a day and there is very little in the way of education and rehabilitation. The resources are not there.” The Streatham attack, carried out by 20-year-old Sudesh Amman, who had been convicted of terrorist offences and was under police surveillance after being released from prison in January, bore horrific echoes of the attack at London Bridge last year. Amman stabbed three people before being shot dead by police. “The variety and type of religion these terrorists claim to follow is not what Islam is commonly held to be about, so you have to wonder why someone at the age of 20 has chosen that path,” said Merritt. “It can’t just be to do with somebody preaching to this particular doctrine; it must have something to do with his background, his life experiences, his experiences of living in Britain as an Asian man – what motivates somebody to kill random, innocent people? I don’t understand how people get to that point particularly at that age.” Response has been varied in the days following the attack. Dame Louise Casey, a former government tsar on integration, called for a “terrorists register” in which offenders would be tracked for life “similar to the one sex offenders have to sign”. “All terrorists who are convicted of offences, regardless of how serious, would be forced to register for life,” said Casey. “We could then monitor them and intervene in their life regularly. We would know where they were at all times.” Fiyaz Mughal, founder of Faith Matters and Tell MAMA, called for “younger Muslim chaplains in prisons so that they can tackle the youth of extremism … More than ever, we need to invest in recruiting and training younger Muslim prison chaplains to deradicalise extremists.” Nazir Afzal, the former chief public prosecutor, recommended a major policy overhaul addressing the root causes of radicalisation. “Look at what the police had to do to the Streatham terrorist. Continuous surveillance from several officers is mightily expensive, and the redirection of even a small proportion of these funds to deradicalisation would be an impressive saving in limited resources, not to mention lives.”   Related: We won’t defeat terrorism by locking people up forever | Martha Spurrier    Merritt agreed. “You can’t overlook the fact that an enormous amount of money has been taken out of the system in the 10 years the Conservatives have been in government. The Ministry of Justice has suffered cuts of 40% since 2010 and you can’t run a prison system by slashing like that. The system is failing.” While still struggling to process the murder of his son, Merritt said he felt compelled to understand why homegrown terror attacks occured and how they might be prevented. “Belgium seems to have a very effective programme; they have more people returning from fighting in Syria than any other European country and they have managed to contain these sorts of attacks. Why are we not looking at their model of deradicalisation?” • This article was amended on Sunday 9 February to correct Jack Merritt’s age."
109,terror,London commuters 'stampede' out of Bank tube station over terror fears,"Commuters stampeded out of an underground station in the City of London on Friday after a fire alarm was set off during a fight and false rumours circulated that somebody had a bomb. Passengers have described terrifying scenes at Bank station in the heart of the capital’s financial district during the morning rush hour, when hundreds of people ran for their lives and dropped their luggage following an altercation. British Transport Police (BTP) said officers attended Monument underground station, which is linked to Bank station, at 8.54am after a fire alarm was triggered. “Inquiries revealed there had been a fight,” it said in a statement. “During the fight the alarm was pressed. The station was evacuated as a precaution but has since reopened.” Commuters said armed police ran towards the platforms as people were leaving via the stairs, while Transport for London (TfL) staff directed people towards the Monument exit.    Nothing gets the blood pumping quite like armed police running into your station while it&#39;s being evacuated #BankStation pic.twitter.com/aMXZC2513R&mdash; Rich Wisken (@RichWisken) August 2, 2019    “The ‘Inspector Sands’ emergency code was being relayed from the loudspeaker, which was soon replaced with a pre-recorded emergency evacuation recording,” said Rich Wisken, who lives in east London. “A couple of armed policemen were shouting at people to get out of the way as they ran down the stairs.” Another passenger, who formerly worked for a government department, also said the ‘Inspector Sands’ emergency code was being played over the tannoy. “I put it all together and thought there was a dangerous incident,” she said, asking not to be named. “You assume it’s because of a bomb or someone having a weapon. And then to find out it was because of a fight. It was completely mismanaged. I’ve not seen anything like it. It was quite dangerous.”    What the hell just happened at Bank station!!?? Never been more scared in my life #bankstation&mdash; Nags (@x_nags) August 2, 2019    TfL confirmed that the station was evacuated at about 8.50am, before being reopened 25 minutes later. A spokesman said it was standard practice to evacuate a station in the event of a fire alarm being set off. Gemma Tolfree, from Wimbledon, said: “The train pulled up at Bank as normal and people got off. A minute later everyone on the platform ran towards the exits screaming. Someone from the platform shouted that someone had a bomb.” A commuter from south London, who also wished not to be named, said people were “running for their lives”.    I can’t even get over how terrifying these ten minutes of running were this morning at #bankstation Was talking with a woman outside of the station who had literally lost her shoes in the mass scramble.

People were screaming and shouting as they were being pushed. On the train, people started lying down on the floor and people from outside started to pile in as well. “People who came on to the train were saying there was ‘someone with a gun’, which turned out not to be true. I can only describe the scenes as utter panic, people were running for their lives. On the train people were crying, shaking and in a state of complete shock. It was a terrifying experience.” In a statement, BTP added: “Due to its close proximity, the fire alarm at Bank station was also triggered and the station was evacuated but has also since reopened. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of affray. They remain in police custody. No weapons are reported to have been seen during the fight.”"
110,terror,Anne Hidalgo: 'Being Paris mayor is like piloting a catamaran in a gale',"When Anne Hidalgo was elected mayor of Paris in 2014 she thought she knew what running the French capital involved after a decade as first deputy. 
In the event, no amount of experience could have prepared her for what was to come. 
Before her first year in office was out, there had been terrorist attacks on Charlie Hebdo newspaper and the Hyper Cacher supermarket. Ten months later, the capital was devastated by a series of suicide bombings and shootings that left 131 dead, and Parisians shocked, grief-stricken and fearful.

Her six years at City Hall have also seen two serious floods, several heatwaves – temperatures in Paris rose to a record 42.6 C last summer – 16 months of weekly Gilets Jaunes protests and, since December, demonstrations against the government’s pension reforms. 
“It’s not been a very easy time. We’ve had some terrible shocks and catastrophes, lots of events that could not have been foreseen: terrorism; a massive influx of refugees and migrants and an acceleration of the climate emergency,” she says. 
“It’s not enough to want to be mayor of Paris because it’s fun or because you are running this magnificent city, you have to have broad and solid shoulders. It’s been like piloting a catamaran in an almost permanent force 7-9 wind for six years.” 
In her place, she says, some might have said “enough” but Madame la Maire as she is now called – previously the noun maire was always masculine, never mind the gender of the incumbent – is seeking a second term in office. 
“You have to ask, why do I want to be here, when I could be doing something a little easier? You have to work on your relationship with power … then you have to be methodical and rational, criticise, analyse before acting, understand, ask questions around you and of yourself, and once you have decided on a path, follow it. Otherwise, you are just a headless chicken,” she says. 
She is a technocrat who abhors populism and putting a celebrity spin on political life. She smiles a lot and is collegiate – her deputy mayors are loyal and she defers to them – but the smiles mask a steely determination.

The core of Hidalgo’s first term in office has been tackling pollution and making Paris greener. Key is the idea of the 15-minute city, where residents can find most of what they need – shops, leisure facilities, education – on or near their doorstep. Her programme also includes planting thousands more trees to create mini urban forests, new parks, gardens and vegetable patches on roofs. 
“We have 10 years to act on the climate emergency. To act, not sit around for 10 years thinking and discussing how to act,” she says. 
One of her most controversial acts of the last six years has been to pedestrianise the main highway along the right bank of the Seine, turning it into a long narrow park for walkers, cyclists, musicians and cafes.

Parisian taxi drivers and private car owners are among the fiercest critics of her crusade to discourage individual vehicle use and tackle pollution by pedestrianising other swathes of the city centre, which has resembled a vast construction site at times. 
The motoring lobby says the subsequent build up of traffic has made air quality worse, but Hidalgo is unrepentant arguing her measures will eventually pay off. Under her guidance, the city council has already voted to ban diesel cars from 2024 and petrol cars from 2030.

“We’ve given vehicle owners plenty of notice so they cannot complain they were not warned,” she says. “The place for the car in our city will be reduced even more with more alternative mobility available like bicycles, more buses and car sharing.” 
Hidalgo is a figure who inspires valedictions and vilification. Residents of the more chic arrondissements, generally south and west of the River Seine, dislike her calls for “solidarity”, an ideology in which not all social housing, migrants, homeless and drug addicts are pushed out to grittier districts to the north and east. She is an avowed enemy of Airbnb regarding it as a form of property speculation that robs the city’s rental market of much needed homes and wants to reduce the maximum number of rental nights to 30 a year. 
Keeping the middle and working classes living in the city is a challenge, but she says her 2016 pledge to increase social housing, introduce rent controls and encourage public/private investment in development is paying off. 
Cleaning the city is a delicate question, especially as Paris gears up to host the 2024 Olympics. “It’s true Paris is not clean enough,” she says. “We are currently paying €550m a year to keep the city clean, we have added rubbish bins, we have increased the number of cleaners and adapted their working hours to meet the need. And still it’s not enough. This means we have another, deeper problem, a collective subject, a question of education.”

Spanish-born Hidalgo grew up on a housing estate near Lyon and became French in her teens. Her maternal grandfather, Antonio, fled General Franco’s fascist Spain in 1937, crossing the Pyrenees with his family on a donkey. He returned two years later and was jailed, his family in San Fernando near Cádiz outcast as “children of the reds”. 
“I rise early. I go to bed late. I have few weekends and even fewer holidays but I’m not complaining. This is a choice I have made, a choice accepted by my husband and family and not a simple one for them,” she says. “It’s particularly difficult for my children who obviously didn’t choose to have a mother who is famous and recognised and who is sometimes the object of attacks, like anyone in the public eye.” 
The mayoral job is often seen as a springboard to the Elysée Palace, but Hidalgo insists – as she has done every time she has been asked over the last six years – she has no intention of standing for president. 
“My job is to transform this extraordinary, magnificent city without damaging it. To make it a city agreeable to live in but one that is a model that that inspires, without denying its history,” she says. 
“It comes down to values. In a worrying, anxious-making, changing world, values are the only compass. When I’m not sure what to do, when I have low points, I refer back to my values, I ask myself: why do I want to do this or that, what is in the general interest? When you are mayor of Paris you have to think about more than yourself.”"
111,terror,MI5 analysing former terror suspects to catch potential attackers,"MI5 has created a new category to rank terrorist suspects and is increasing the number of behavioural scientists it uses by 50% to improve the agency’s chances of catching former jihadists who re-engage with planning attacks, the Guardian has learned. The moves follow a series of attacks in the UK in 2017, two of which were carried out by former “subjects of interest”. In those cases, active MI5 investigations were dropped only for the suspects to later kill civilians. The measures are part of a package of changes introduced after the atrocities. Internal reviews led to 125 recommendations to improve counter-terrorism efforts by MI5, the domestic security service, and counter-terrorism policing. Whitehall sources claim the measures have already led to investigations being reopened on suspects previously thought to pose a lower level of danger. MI5 is under pressure to show it learned lessons after the attacks. That pressure is expected to grow this week after the agency’s deputy head of international counter-terrorism testifies for two days at the London Bridge inquest. Lawyers for the eight bereaved families claim “opportunities galore” were missed to thwart the attack. The ringleader, Khuram Butt, is believed to be the first suspect under live investigation by MI5 to have carried out an attack. Until now, MI5 had lists of about 3,000 people under live investigation and a larger category of 20,000 who were previously under active investigation. The security services and police are currently managing an Islamist terror threat of a scale and duration greater than expected. In 2017, Khalid Masood in Westminster and Salman Abedi in Manchester came from the category of closed “subjects of interest” (SOIs), MI5’s term for suspects. The agency is introducing new “tripwires” to warn its analysts that former SOIs may be posing an increasing threat. The signs include traumatic life events such as losing a job, and relationship issues. MI5 is making greater use of behavioural analysis to study the 20,000 former suspects, a number that is understood to be growing.  A senior Whitehall source said: “There is a category [within the former SOIs] of individuals who are more likely to be engaged in terrorism than others. Former SOIs sit at different points of the spectrum in terms of risk. Within the 20,000, there is a category deemed more likely to re-engage. The new process recognises that closed SOIs are on a spectrum of risk – it is not binary.” The Guardian understands that after the London Bridge atrocity, Theresa May demanded that the police and MI5 “regain the momentum” during a crisis meeting with counter-terrorism chiefs. The attacks led MI5 and counter-terrorism police to set up internal reviews. They were assessed by the barrister David Anderson, as were a series of new measures. Spotting former suspects who re-engage has been an enduring problem for counter-terrorism investigators. The Whitehall source said: “Because of the behavioural analysis we are doing, it will make us more likely to spot individuals re-engaging and those who are most likely to re-engage. Behavioural analysis is a huge part of this. Some cases have already been reopened because of this process.” Masood had been investigated in 2012. At the time of the Westminster attack his file was closed. Masood drove a car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, then ran into the Palace of Westminster, where he stabbed PC Keith Palmer to death before being shot dead. The active investigation into Abedi was closed in 2014. He would go on to bomb Manchester Arena, killing 22 people. His case was on the verge of being reopened, and intelligence pointing to his danger had been received by MI5, but the threat he posed was not fully appreciated by analysts. “MI5 can’t justify intrusion into former SOIs where there is no evidence or intelligence of risk,” the source said. “We are not able and do not have the resources to monitor them all. We are trying to improve the tripwires. We are trying to identify triggers to spot if someone is re-engaging.” Only a limited section of Anderson’s review was published. An update is due soon."
112,terror,"From The Terror to Event Horizon, TV horror is a screaming success","It is the 21st century’s most influential multinational, an omnipresent Tyrell Corporation pushing AI assistants and drone deliveries. So it is hardly a surprise that Amazon is horny for science fiction. When hard-bitten galactic noir The Expanse was cancelled after three seasons on Netflix, Amazon swooped in to save it. In the UK, it provided a streaming berth for Halle Berry’s alien-baby thriller Extant. And their man in the high castle, Jeff Bezos, seems genuinely jazzed to bring Iain M Banks’s sprawling Culture space opera novels to a device near you. With all that in mind, the news that Amazon is looking to salvage Event Horizon – the lurid 1997 movie about a drifting space hulk with a sanity-destroying secret – and retool it into a TV series feels like just another step in its sci-fi masterplan. But it will also see the platform elbowing into another dark yet crowded corner of the TV market: the mushrooming world of small-screen horror.              The original Event Horizon’s horror gimmick was to put a Clive Barker spin on Star Trek. It posed the question: what happens if you build a hyperdrive engine but it accidentally jumps your spacecraft to hell and back? The answer, apparently, is that a malignant evil will drive the crew insane by bombarding them with nightmarish visions until the ship erupts into a bloody bacchanal of violence and torture. It is Solaris reimagined as a Slipknot video. Tellingly, the experimental gravity drive – invented by Sam Neill’s tormented boffin Dr Weir – resembles a gigantic gothic meat-grinder. The man tasked with wrangling Event Horizon V2.0 into shape is Adam Wingard, the writer-director behind the taut thriller The Guest and the recent Blair Witch sequel, and he can probably completely rewire the source material without being accused of corrupting a sacred text. The original film initially stumbled at the box office before becoming a cult curio on VHS, and part of its disreputable legend was that scaredy-cat executives insisted director Paul WS Anderson – who would go on to oversee the durable Resident Evil movie franchise – cut some of the goriest scenes. Even hardcore fans would agree that the movie is a compromised vision.     The most chilling show yet? ... Ridley Scott’s The Terror: Infamy. Photograph: Ed Araquel/AMC    The real challenge facing Wingard will be to stand out from the head-lopping, grave-robbing crowd. Right now, horror movies – hair-raising, fun to watch with friends and, crucially, cheap – feel like the only backstop against the superhero hegemony, and the symbiotic relationship between film and TV means there has been a trickle-down effect that has filled the schedules with would-be chillers. Barely a week goes by without another horror anthology TV series being announced (or cancelled), with the Ridley Scott-produced chiller The Terror, which has just returned for a second season, leading the way. Horror novels have also been gleefully filleted, from Netflix’s unsettling hit The Haunting of Hill House to AMC’s limo-driven boogeyman NOS4A2 and FX’s hinge-jawed vampire nightmare The Strain. Genre godhead Stephen King even has his own mashed-up mini-universe in the form of Hulu’s Castle Rock (available on Amazon in the UK). After a cluster of relatively straight-faced efforts, including a gloomy expansion of The Exorcist that lasted two seasons and the unexpectedly good Psycho spin-off Bates Motel, the recent surge of film-to-TV horror adaptations seem to have steered hard into shlock. Some of the results have been entertaining (such as Starz’s Ash Vs Evil Dead, a gleeful expansion of Sam Raimi’s original) while others (notably MTV’s seemingly unkillable Scream reboot, now on its third season) seem merely shrill. While technically an original series, Ryan Murphy’s Scream Queens took most of its campy cues from well-worn slasher movie tropes, while the upcoming American Horror Story: 1984 – the ninth season of Murphy’s sturdy horror anthology – is set in a kitsch sleepaway camp familiar to anyone who has ever watched a Friday the 13th flick.     An unsettling hit ... The Haunting of Hill House. Photograph: Steve Dietl/Netflix    Wingard is in the captain’s chair of his cursed starship, so is free to plot whatever course he wishes. Event Horizon has such a splattery reputation that doubling down on the gore-orgies and improvised body modification would be the obvious thing to do. (The film’s signature line – “Where we’re going, we don’t need eyes to see” – comes after a particularly gruesome bit of self-surgery.) But it also feels like a potential opportunity to speak to the current political and cultural moment. An event horizon is essentially a point of no return, and we are currently being bombarded with grave messages of environmental tipping points reached and societal red lines breached. The original film was set in 2047 but on our current timeline we might need Sam Neill to genuinely invent faster-than-light space travel before then to guarantee humankind’s survival. Or maybe Wingard could lean into a juicy twist: his experimental starship successfully warps to a place that is so hellish it drives you insane … but it is actually just visiting our current universe."
113,terror,London attack: PM says terrorism sentence changes may be applied retrospectively,"Prisoners already jailed for terrorism offences could face retrospective changes to their sentences to deny them early release, after a man just freed from jail carried out a knife attack in south London, Boris Johnson has said. Speaking at the end of a speech mainly concerned with Brexit, the prime minister said the government could go down the potentially legally tricky route of changing release conditions for those already in jail, following two recent incidents involving released Islamist attackers. Sudesh Amman was shot dead by police in Streatham on Sunday after stabbing two people. The 20-year-old had been freed after serving half of his sentence of more than three years for the possession and distribution of extremist material and was under active police surveillance. The attack left one person initially in a life-threatening condition. After a man with a similar sentencing history killed two people at London Bridge in November, Johnson promised to change the law to end automatic early release for those convicted of terrorism offences. On Monday he said this could now be applied to those already in jail. “The difficulty is how to apply that retrospectively to the cohort of people who currently qualify,” the prime minister said. “We do think it’s time to take action to ensure that people, irrespective of the law we’re bringing in, people in the current stream do not qualify automatically for early release, people convicted of terrorist offences. “I hope people understand that the anomaly we need to clear up is the process by which some people are still coming out under automatic early release without any kind of scrutiny or parole system.” More details would emerge soon via the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, Johnson added. Answering a question about how people could be reassured, Johnson said the aim was that no one jailed for terrorism should be released “without some process of parole or scrutiny by real experts in the matter – cynical, hardened people who can look into their eyes and really think whether or not these people again pose a danger to the public”. Deradicalising Islamists was difficult, Johnson said: “Looking at the problems we have with re-educating and reclaiming and rehabilitating people who succumb to Islamism is very, very hard, and very tough. “It can happen but the instances of success are really very few, and we need to be frank about that. We need to think about how we handle that in our criminal justice system.” Speaking earlier, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, rejected the idea that cuts to prison and probation services had made it harder to rehabilitate or monitor terrorism suspects. He told BBC1’s Breakfast: “The counter-terrorism budget, which is what we’re dealing with here, has actually been increased every year for the last five or six years. “It is now up 30% or 40% from where it was several years ago. And we just announced a 10% increase, taking it to almost £1bn for the forthcoming year.” He said the government was doubling the number of specific counter-terrorism probation officers and creating new places in probationary hostels. “This is all forming part of the plans that we’re putting in place to keep people safe.”   Map   After Sunday’s attack, three victims were taken by ambulance to south London hospitals. One man, in his 40s, was no longer considered to be in a life-threatening condition after treatment, police said. A woman, in her 50s, who had non-life-threatening injuries has been discharged from hospital. Police said a second woman in her 20s, who sustained minor injuries believed to have been caused by glass after the discharge of a police firearm, was still receiving treatment. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said he was alarmed that Amman had been freed even though he was considered a sufficient danger to be followed by armed police. “Why didn’t the probation service, the prison service, properly punish and reform him?” Khan asked on BBC1’s Breakfast. “And also, why was he allowed to be released if the authorities knew he was a danger?” Speaking earlier, on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, he said the attack was “clearly foreseeable”. “But for an inch this way or that way, but for the brilliance of the medics and the speed of the police, there would have been two fatalities and many more,” Khan said. “And that’s one of the reasons why I’m not just frustrated but I’m angry at the changes made in the past and the lack of progress in making the changes we were promised in November.”       Mobile phone footage of the incident showed officers wearing plain clothes arriving on the scene at high speed, firing about five gunshots and killing Amman outside a branch of Boots pharmacy. They were carrying pistols that are normally used by surveillance officers.   Map of Streatham High Road showing White Lion pub and Boots   Police continued their investigations overnight, with search warrants being used at two addresses, in south London and Bishop’s Stortford. Amman pledged allegiance to Islamic State in messages to his girlfriend at the time he was jailed, and said he wanted to carry out terrorist attacks. He wrote to her: “If you can’t make a bomb because family, friends or spies are watching or suspecting you, take a knife, molotov, sound bombs or a car at night and attack.”"
114,terror,We won’t defeat terrorism by locking people up forever,"This week we were all given reason to question how safe we feel on our streets. On Sunday, a 20-year-old took a knife and injured three people on a busy high street before being shot dead by police officers. Like the terrorist attack on London Bridge, we have once again been confronted with the fragility of life.   Related: UK may bypass human rights convention  to rush through terror laws    In the aftermath of terror events there is always an immediate call for more to be done to tackle extremism. It is understandable that we want to feel safe, yet at times like this it is more important than ever to remember that public panic is the exact response that terrorism hopes to provoke. In the race to issue a response, rather than thoughtful reflection on what’s working and what isn’t, it’s tempting for politicians to make bold promises to rid our streets of terror once and for all. That’s what happened on Sunday after the attack in Streatham. There was remarkably little time for soul-searching. In less than 12 hours, the home secretary was announcing new initiatives to tackle extremism – later revealed to be a promise to lock up terrorists for ever. Sadly for all of us who want a safer world, these proposals did little to offer real reassurance. Loud, strong-arm announcements that talk of “getting tough” should always be viewed with suspicion. We deserve solutions that work, not kneejerk reactions that entrench the problems they’re supposed to solve. That means we need to be having evidence-based conversations about long-term solutions.     Everyone has a right to serve the prison sentence they were given when they were tried by an independent judge    These should start with an appraisal of the government’s failing Prevent counter-terrorism strategy. It’s a blunt and ineffective tool that can profile children as extremists based on the colour of their skin, and has labelled environment campaign group Extinction Rebellion as a threat. It has become just another instrument of coercion and control that has no hope of addressing the complex causes of violent extremism. It is not based on evidence, its effectiveness has not been reviewed and, given recent events, it’s clearly not working. Liberty, along with others, has been campaigning to get an independent review of Prevent. This hasn’t happened. A review was announced but had to be deferred after the reviewer was, by his own admission, biased towards Prevent. In the noise of press coverage in the last few days, the government’s silence on this failed strategy is deafening. Instead, we have a familiar playbook of punitive, short-term measures that may grab headlines but won’t save lives. It’s easy to suggest that locking people up for longer will reduce the threat of terrorism. At best it defers the problem, at worst it leaves people languishing in a broken prison system, stripped of the resources required to rehabilitate them. And if we don’t rehabilitate people, we can never end violent crime.  Over the next week, we’ll no doubt see attention focused on the people convicted of terrorism who are on the brink of release. Those who believe they should be kept locked up while the government sorts out its act should contemplate what they are giving away in the process, and what seeds they’re sowing. It’s a very old story that if the state abuses the civil liberties of its population it breeds division, mistrust and danger. If this government starts locking people up indefinitely, it will have surrendered the very values that separate us from terrorists. If there’s any doubt about that, reflect on the British government’s policy of internment in Northern Ireland in 1971, and its catastrophic consequences for peace. While the threat to lengthen people’s jail terms retrospectively might sound like a necessary approach, it also risks breaking the law because everyone – including convicted criminals – has a right to serve the prison sentence they were given when they were tried by an independent judge, not one imposed at the whim of a politician playing to the public gallery. And to break the law for what? Ultimately, these moves don’t offer solutions. They offer no hope of terrorism being eradicated, no hope of rehabilitation. Not to mention that longer prison terms come with a hefty public spending bill.  What has been lost in all of this is accountability. This should be a chance for the state to reflect on what’s working and what’s not, and to build a strategy that protects all our rights and freedoms and keeps us safe. We need initiatives that stop us from being victims and discourage us from being perpetrators. As hard as it is to be a voice of restraint at times like these, it’s more important than ever to stick to our principles and stand up to power. • Martha Spurrier is a British barrister and human rights campaigner and the director of Liberty"
115,terror,Streatham attack shows Britain needs new ideas on deradicalisation,"There has been a pattern to recent terror attacks in the UK. A perpetrator, frequently alone, launches an attack, innocent lives are lost or changed irreversibly, questions are asked of the police, the probation services, the prisons, a government minister responds, often with a change in legislation, media reports settle and talk of terrorism fades, that is, until it happens all over again. In its response to the attack in Streatham on Sunday, the government is once again focusing on the length of time a terrorist offender spends in prison. In the case of Sudesh Amman, he spent just over a year and was released automatically at the midway point of his sentence.   Related: Sudesh Amman: how did science student become Streatham jihadist?    The full custodial term handed down to any offender cannot be retrospectively altered – although the government announced on Monday that it would attempt to retrospectively change the point at which they can be released, a change likely to affect roughly 200 terrorists currently in prison and be subject to legal challenge. Therefore such a move does not address issues specific to offenders like Usman Khan, who killed two people on London Bridge last year, and Amman, both of whom had served time in jail for terror offences. To break the cycle, many have argued it is time for the government to put some time, energy and resources into what happens inside prison, as well as how long offenders should be locked up. No matter when an individual is released, and with the exception of a limited number of the most serious cases, they are all going to have to be released eventually. Nazir Afzal, a former chief prosecutor in the north-west, said without an effective rehabilitation process, delaying release of a prisoner is just delaying an inevitable attack. “Yes, a longer sentence, we could have delayed this inevitable crime by a few months, if we’d given him that,” he told BBC Radio 4. “But there is a real problem with deradicalisation and disengagement programmes. They have been largely underfunded. They are poorly executed. This is all down to the impact of austerity on the probation service.” He added: “There’s no formal mechanism to risk assess them, they will commit this crime unless there something is done about this in the prison. Yes, longer sentences will have an impact but it just delays the inevitable.” Currently, the main deradicalisation programme in prisons is called the healthy identity intervention (HII), which delivers one-to-one individually tailored sessions. But ultimately it is experimental. The Ministry of Justice completed a “process evaluation” when it was piloted and found it was well received by facilitators and participants but its success will not be determined for two more years.   Related: The Guardian view on terrorists who reoffend: the response must not be rushed | Editorial    While its HII’s success is yet to be formally determined, the delivery of such programmes comes against a backdrop of brutal 40% cuts to the Ministry of Justice, and therefore the prison and probation services for which the department is responsible, over the last 10 years. And what we do know is convicted terrorists are having to be put on waiting lists for the HII programme. Prof Andrew Silke, who has studied efforts to deradicalise those jailed for terrorism offences, told the Guardian some prisoners who have said they are willing, never get on the programme before their release. We also know that the first ever terrorist act committed within prison walls happened last month. Four officers and a nurse were injured at HMP Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire, on Thursday. One of the attackers is understood to be Brusthom Ziamani, who was guilty of preparing an act of terrorism in 2015. The independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Jonathan Hall, has warned that for some, prison “may also provide a perfectly receptive and captive audience for recruitment”. “Prison does not affect all individuals equally and it may well be that for some individuals prison increases their status in the network and prolongs their activism,” he said in a speech to the Henry Jackson Society last month. “It may also provide a perfectly receptive and captive audience for recruitment.” He added: “That doesn’t mean that prison is not the right remedy, but its consequences must be addressed, including, as the recent HMP Whitemoor attacks show, recognising that terrorism offending does not stop at the prison door and there is no automatic ‘job done’ when a terrorist is behind bars.” In fact, a judge last week told a vulnerable man who had been convicted of encouraging far-right terror attacks he would be “liable to radicalisation” inside jail that could increase the risk he poses and sentenced him to a community sentence. A former prison governor and Whitehall official, Ian Acheson, was commissioned by then justice secretary Michael Gove, to review radicalisation in prisons and come up with some practical solutions. The main recommendation was to develop a network of high-security separation centres – quickly dubbed “jihadi jails” – to remove hardliners from the mainstream prison population and to limit the spread of radicalisation. But a recent assessment suggested a perfunctory implementation of the proposals. Staff at two of the three separation centres told MoJ researchers that referral rates to the units were too low. Frankland prison and Full Sutton prison each have the capacity to hold eight prisoners, but between June 2017 and December 2018 were holding only three to six prisoners on average. A third facility at Woodhill prison is reportedly empty. The Ministry of Justice previously estimated that about 700 to 1,000 prisoners are considered a risk owing to their extremist views and as of 31 March 2019 there were 223 people in custody in Britain for terrorism-related offences. Acheson told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that he remained “concerned” about the prison service’s ability to manage terrorist offenders. He said: “I am still unconvinced that the prison service itself has the aptitude or the attitude to assertively manage terrorist offenders.” The prime minister, Boris Johnson, told reporters on Monday that while deradicalisation could work, there had been few successes. This might be accurate in the UK, but worldwide there are examples of effective practice. Belgium had the highest European levels of foreign terrorist fighters travelling to the Syria and Iraq conflict, which led to the country developing its own approach to violent extremism and preventing radicalisation. Primarily, it is the regional and local levels that focus on prevention and resilience-building. The city of Vilvoorde has drawn frequent praise for its innovative and hands-on response to radicalisation and violent extremism. Denmark has developed a programme that focuses on reintegration of foreign fighters, rather than terrorist prisoners, but its principles are worth noting with its focus on reintegration, rather than punishment. In an interview with the Guardian, Supt Allan Aarslev, who is in charge of the police end of the programme in his city of Aarhus, said: “What’s easy is to pass tough new laws. Harder is to go through a real process with individuals: a panel of experts, counselling, healthcare, assistance getting back into education, with employment, maybe accommodation. With returning to everyday life and society. We don’t do this out of political conviction; we do it because we think it works.”"
116,terror,Campaign calls for entertainment venues to plan for terror attack,"A group representing terrorism survivors will call on the Home Office to require all venues and public spaces – from arenas to pubs – to prepare a dedicated security plan in case of an attack. Called Martyn’s law, the proposal is named after Martyn Hett, who was killed in the Manchester arena attack two years ago, and is supported by his mother, other terror survivors and former counter-terror police officers.   Related: UK Muslim leaders urge protection for mosques after Christchurch    But the Home Office has so far resisted the idea, prompting campaigners to go public and lobby the remaining contenders in the Conservative leadership contest for their support. Figen Murray, Hett’s mother, said that she “never set out to be an activist or stir things up” but, a year after her son was one of 22 killed in the Manchester attack, she felt she had to act after visiting a theatre where no security checks were performed. “I had wrongly assumed that since the attack in May 2017, venues would have learned their lessons and would have put stringent security checks in place. I was devastated to see that this was not the case,” Murray said. “It felt as if what happened in Manchester on that fateful night had been forgotten.” Murray will hold a press conference on Wednesday, where she and other campaigners will appear alongside Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, and a retired counter-terror officer who says he has been arguing for reform for years. Nick Aldworth, a former chief superintendent with the Metropolitan police, said he and other senior officers wanted the Home Office to legislate on “commonsense” security steps. He added: “Ministers mustn’t delay action on this any further.” Concerns have been raised by the Home Office that for all venues to have a counter-terror plan would impose extra costs on business, although Survivors Against Terror says that venues already have to comply with fire safety and other regulations. Insiders from the campaign group say they are confident that the Home Office’s initial reluctance can be overcome. “I think that this has been one of those issues that has been lost in Brexit,” one campaigner said.   Related: Far-right terrorists are one step ahead of you in UK, police told    The group argues that large venues, such as the MEN Arena, should be required to have a more detailed plan, while pubs and bars should be allowed to produce something simpler because a one-size-fits-all model won’t work. The idea is that venues could be held to account over their plan if a location was attacked, and that most of the measures required, such as security staff, CCTV or metal detectors, are already likely to be in place. A report produced by Aldworth for Survivors Against Terror says that “there are no laws in the UK aimed at providing counter-terrorism protective security”. Councils should be required to produce their own counter-terror plan, Aldworth added. The debate continues about what lessons can be learned from the spate of terror attacks in 2017. Next week the inquests into the deaths of eight people during the London Bridge attack should conclude. Inquests for those killed in the Manchester attack are due to begin in April 2020."
117,terror,Dutton says 'leftwing lunatics' must be dealt with as Asio warns of far-right threat,"Peter Dutton has declared that “leftwing terrorism” includes Islamist extremism after being blasted by Labor for applying false equivalence in the national security debate. Dutton’s intervention on Tuesday was triggered by a speech by the director general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio) Mike Burgess. On Monday night, Australia’s top intelligence chief warned the threat of rightwing extremism in Australia was real and growing. Burgess said the number of overall terrorism leads under investigation had doubled over the past year. The director general did not mention leftwing extremism at all during the address.   Related: Asio boss warns of rising foreign interference and far-right extremism in Australia    Dutton began the day on Tuesday by telling reporters it was important for security agencies to deal with threats from both rightwing and leftwing “lunatics”. “If somebody is going to cause harm to Australians, I just don’t care whether they’re on the far right, far left, somewhere in between, they will be dealt with,” the home affairs minister said. “And if the proliferation of information into the hands of rightwing lunatics or leftwing lunatics is leading to a threat in our country, then my responsibility is to make sure our agencies are dealing with it and they are.” After facing sustained criticism from Labor about applying false equivalence in the national security debate, Dutton declared on Tuesday afternoon he didn’t want to get bogged down in a “semantic and nonsense debate”. Asked by the ABC to clarify whether when he referred to leftwing terrorism he meant Islamist groups, Dutton said: “Yes, I do and anybody in between.” The minister did not explain how Islamic extremists constituted leftwing terrorism. Advice from Asio nominates Sunni Islamist extremism as Australia’s primary terror threat, and it notes Islamist groups are “diverse and have differing agendas, including extreme rightwing and extreme leftwing ideologies”. But Dutton told the ABC: “You can use leftwing to describe everybody from the left to the right. “I said today, I don’t care where people are on the spectrum, if they pose a threat to our country and want to do harm to Australians, then they are in our sights.” The shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, told the ABC that Islamic terrorism “doesn’t sit upon a left/right continuum” and it was important that the government rely on Asio advice. Keneally said if the Asio director general had pointed to “neo-Nazi cells in Australia, rightwing extremist groups, pos[ing] a terrorist threat in Australia, why haven’t they been listed?” The Labor MP Ed Husic called for an urgent review of the threat posed by rightwing extremism. “Nowhere beyond the mouth of the home affairs minister have people been talking about so-called leftwing extremism,” Husic told Sky News. “The fact that the home affairs minister sought to inject that level of politicisation into this demonstrates more of a reflection of his thinking. “I would be calling on the government to refer to the joint parliamentary committee on intelligence and security an urgent review into what is happening in respect to rightwing extremism in Australia.”   Related: The hate factory: inside a far-right Facebook network    The Labor MP Anne Aly, who was a counter-terrorism expert before she entered parliament, noted America had upgraded the threat of rightwing terrorism, and “in Germany a rightwing terrorist attack has led to an increase in their threat levels”. “In Australia the head of Asio has repeated that there is an increased threat from rightwing extremists – so which part of rightwing extremists does the minister not understand?” Dutton said on Tuesday the Morrison government would list rightwing extremist groups as terrorist organisations “if the advice from Asio is that we should”. “If [Asio] provide the advice to me, recommending that any organisation, rightwing or other, fits the criteria and is to be listed on their recommendation, I will list it,” the home affairs minister said. While the debate about false equivalence played out in public, Guardian Australia has also confirmed that one of the minister’s advisers cited the climate activist group Extinction Rebellion as an example of a troublesome leftwing organisation during a telephone conversation with a member of the public who sought to query Dutton’s controversial intervention in the debate. Matthew Noel, an engineering student from New South Wales, says he rang Dutton’s ministerial office in Canberra on Tuesday morning.  Noel says he telephoned to try to establish exactly who the minister was referring to when he raised the spectre of leftwing terrorism. The student says he spoke to an adviser who identified himself as Mark. Noel says the adviser over the course of the call identified the group Extinction Rebellion as an example of leftwing terrorism. Noel says he said to the adviser: “Are you saying Extinction Rebellion are a terrorist group? [The adviser] replied, yes.” Dutton’s office has confirmed the call took place. But a spokeswoman disputes some of Noel’s recollection of the conversation. Dutton’s spokeswoman told Guardian Australia: “The allegation that a member of staff nominated Extinction Rebellion as an example of a leftwing terror group is completely false. “When asked by the caller, the staff member advised that the group is an example of a leftwing extremist group, not a terrorist group.” Asked whether the adviser was reflecting the minister’s view during the conversation, the spokeswoman said: “The minister does not believe this group is a leftwing terror organisation.”"
118,terror,US knew Indonesia intended to stop East Timorese independence 'through terror and violence',"The US government knew for months that Indonesia’s military was supporting and arming militias in East Timor in the lead-up to the 1999 independence referendum but continued to push for stronger military ties, declassified documents have revealed. 
The hundreds of documents provide a window into US policy on the months of terror inflicted on the Timorese and the “muted” attempts by the US to convince Indonesian officials to allow a peaceful and free vote to proceed. 
The formerly classified documents are released in a briefing book by the National Security Archive’s researcher Brad Simpson on Friday to coincide with the 20th anniversary of East Timor’s independence referendum on 30 August 1999. 
They reveal extensive and early awareness within the US government of the Indonesian military (formerly ABRI, now TNI) and its “determination to thwart an independence vote in East Timor through terror and violence”. 
State department v Pentagon 
 
  
  It was widely believed TNI supported the militia, and Cohen was also concerned of indications militias were considering targeting Interfet. 
  
 
Clinton Fernandes, a professor of international and political studies at the University of New South Wales, said the documents illustrated a split between the US state department concerned with the TNI-backed militia violence and the Pentagon striving to preserve a military relationship in the face of widespread opposition. 
Fernandes said one key document – describing a meeting between US secretary of defence William Cohen and the Indonesian commander of the armed forces, General Wiranto, less than two weeks after International Force for East Timor (Interfet) forces landed in East Timor – starkly demonstrated that it was the military which mattered to Indonesia. 
 
  
  
   
    
    Why did East Timor hold a referendum in 1999?
    The landmark vote in 1999, in which 78.5% of East Timorese chose independence from Indonesia, was the culmination of 24 years of occupation by Jakarta and, before that, hundreds of years of colonial rule by Portugal.
    Why did Portugal relinquish its far-flung colony?
    In April 1974 a leftwing coup in Lisbon led to Portugal setting its colonial outposts, including then Portuguese Timor, adrift.&nbsp;
    What happened once Portugal left?
    Local elections were held but a coalition between the two biggest parties ended in a short civil war. The biggest party, Fretilin, unilaterally declared independence on 28 November 1975. Indonesia, which was already carrying out secret attacks across the border from West Timor, invaded nine days later.&nbsp;
    Why were the East Timorese so opposed to Indonesian rule?
    Portugal’s colonial influence meant the population was culturally very different from the rest of Indonesia. The vast majority of East Timorese are devout Catholics and speak their own language (Tetun).
    What happened after the invasion?
    The world largely looked the other way and some 200,000 people died over the next 24 years of Indonesian occupation. In July 1976 Indonesia’s parliament declared East Timor the country’s 27th province.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    What happened to the Timorese resistance?
    The armed resistance was decimated and, in 1992, its leader, Xanana Gusmão, was captured and imprisoned in Jakarta. Exiled leaders, like José Ramos-Horta, kept up the fight. In 1996 Ramos-Horta shared the Nobel peace prize with the head of the Catholic church in East Timor, Bishop Carlos Belo. But the brutal occupation continued.
    Why did Indonesia change its stance towards East Timor?
    In 1998 Indonesia's President Suharto, in power for 30 years, resigned amid the Asian financial crisis and massive pro-democracy protests in Jakarta. His successor, BJ Habibie, was more open to some form of autonomy for East Timor. In March 1999 he announced that if the East Timorese favoured independence over autonomy under Indonesia, he would grant it.
    What happened in the referendum and its aftermath?
    On 30 August 1999 the UN oversaw an historic ballot, in which 78.5% of East Timorese rejected autonomy in favour of independence. Indonesian-backed militia groups who had terrorised the population before the vote stepped up their attacks, aided by Indonesian security forces. A three-week campaign of violence killed 2,600 people, nearly 30,000 were displaced and as many as 250,000 were forcibly shipped over the border to Indonesian West Timor, in what amounted to a scorched-earth policy.
    How did the world respond?
    On 20 September 1999 an Australian-led international peacekeeping force, Interfet, arrived to restore order. Gusmão and other exiled leaders returned. Elections in 2002 saw him become newly named Timor Leste's first president
    
   
  
  
 
“As long as there was the dual policy – state department v Pentagon – there were no practical consequences from the state department so Indonesia believed they could get away with it,” he said. “It’s when the defence department – Cohen – steps in that it changes things.” 
Cohen flew to Indonesia and met with Wiranto on 30 September, a month after East Timorese voted overwhelmingly for independence despite months of violence and intimidation only to be met with more from Indonesian military and local pro-integration militias. Thousands had died.

According to a state department cable, Wiranto claimed the situation in East Timor had been “greatly exaggerated by the media” and that now the Australian-led peacekeeping force, Interfet, had been deployed the situation was under control. He continued to deny the TNI had backed militias. 
Cohen responded he would “have to be quite direct and said while TNI had done “some positive things” it had all been overshadowed by events in East Timor. 
“General Wiranto had indicated that some people might have been dissatisfied by the results of the polls, but that could never justify the rampage which had followed,” the cable described Cohen’s words. 
It was widely believed TNI supported the militia, and Cohen was also concerned of indications militias were considering targeting Interfet. 
“Such actions would be tragic if they were allowed.” 
He concluded by saying it was in both nations’ interests to have a positive bilateral relationship but that would not be possible unless Indonesia made progress.

  A declassified cable describes United States Secretary of Defense William Cohen meeting with Indonesian commander of the Armed Forces, General Wiranto, in September 1999.
  
 
Cohen’s “reading of the riot act”, as Fernandes described it, intended to drive home an announcement three weeks earlier by US president Bill Clinton that they would now cut all military ties with Indonesia. 
The decisive action by Clinton and Cohen came, nevertheless, after more than a year of the US working to maintain military ties despite growing evidence of human rights abuses, especially in East Timor. 
As violence escalated, state department officials, including the US assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific Affairs, Stanley Roth, lobbied Indonesia to rein in the militias. 
“But US military officials resisted efforts to pressure the Indonesian armed forces and opposed efforts to reduce military aid, convinced that the Indonesian military remained a crucial force for political and military stability in the archipelago during a fragile democratic transition,” Simpson said. 
Indonesia armed militias before vote 
In January 1999, the new Indonesian president, BJ Habibie, announced that East Timor could have wide-ranging autonomy or quick separation from Indonesia. However, his government was unwilling to let a UN-led international force in before it was decided.

“General Wiranto has stated … publicly … that the military will dutifully support the government’s decision, but many suspect the military’s support is lukewarm at best,” an embassy briefing said. 
The assessment was right, and hundreds of documents spanning months, reveal US officials had gathered evidence and formed the view the Indonesian military was arming militias. 
In February 1999, a state department intelligence report quoted Jakarta embassy officials saying the Indonesian military was “arming small, roving bands of East Timorese paramilitary groups” and that plainclothes military personnel were participating directly in those groups. 
In March, military intelligence noted “close ties” between the military and local militias, “many created by Indonesian Special Forces and Intelligence officers”. It specifically mentioned “Wiranto’s decision in early 1999 to provide hundreds of weapons to militia groups”. It said local district headquarters had supplied ammunition, logistics, and advice. 
By April, the situation in East Timor had drastically deteriorated. 
 
  
  Violence worsened and diplomatic cables showed warnings from Portuguese sources that attacks were expected on the weekend of 16 April. 
  
 
In the days after the 6 April massacre in Liquica, Roth wrote to independence leader Xanana Gusmão and said he had repeatedly “urged the Indonesian government to disarm the civilian militia” and would do again. He also warned Gusmao of his own rhetoric perhaps fanning tension. 
Violence worsened and diplomatic cables showed warnings from Portuguese sources that attacks were expected on the weekend of 16 April – when pro-integration militias took control of Dili with the support of Indonesian security forces, including sharing transport, and committed the Carrascalao massacre. 
The military and police took “no steps to stop the violence” with a military commander reportedly declaring the military “neutral”, an embassy briefing said. 
A morning rally heard calls for a cleansing of the civil service and declared war on “any international presence in East Timor, especially journalists”. 
Roth immediately contacted Indonesia’s foreign minister, Ali Alatas, and noted “a lot of weapons found there way from the military to paramilitary groups”.

While he was not saying Wiranto or Habibie were directly involved “there were just too many reports of the [military] cooperating with the militias”, and there had to be a disarming of both sides. 
“ABRI continues to take little or no action to suppress violence in areas of unrest,” read a military intelligence summary about the estimated killing of more than 50 people in three days. 
By late April, the EU was joining calls for Indonesia to allow the UN in. 
In early May, the CIA added its assessment that Habibie’s plans for East Timor had little support among senior military, including Wiranto. 
“Wiranto … has taken no action against the pro-integration civilian militias or discipline against local military units that, if not abetting, have at the least tolerated these groups,” it said. 
“Wiranto has repeatedly promised that the military is a neutral force, but local commanders would have required at least tacit approval from headquarters in Jakarta to allow the militias the blatant free hand they have enjoyed.” 
Diplomacy fails to quell violence 
American officials were clearly aware TNI was supporting the militias, but diplomatic urgings were having no effect. 
The following month, as the UN mission in East Timor (Unamet) prepared to deploy to oversee the referendum, UN spokesmen were publicly critical of Indonesia’s handling of East Timor. 
 
  
  Embassy officials were told “credible” reports that Kopassus – TNI special forces – had directed militia agents to kidnap or harm a Unamet member. 
  
 
Embassy officials were told “credible” reports that Kopassus – TNI special forces – had directed militia agents to kidnap or harm a Unamet member, and that it was standard operating procedure for the military to “outsource its dirty work to the militias”. 
A Unamet political officer told embassy staff they realised critical statements would produce a sharp reaction but “it had become clear that remonstrations with the military behind closed doors yielded nothing”, and that the unacceptable situation in East Timor was worsening. 
On 21 May, embassy officers were told it was a common belief that “militias planned to ‘welcome’ the first contingent of Unamet police advisors with their guns. 
Embassy staff visited Liquica in June and reported “it is clear that the Indonesian military and pro-integration militias, working together closely, are carrying out a scorched earth policy”. 
In July, Unamet officers told Roth and the US ambassador militias were “merely symptoms of the larger problem of the TNI’s overall strategy”. 
It was “beyond dispute” that TNI was orchestrating militia activity, a redacted Unamet official said, adding that their assessments were based on firsthand observations and a large volume of evidence from the field.

  US Jakarta embassy briefing: Unamet officers detail violence in East Timor.
  
 
On 30 August, the Timorese voted overwhelmingly in favour of independence. Days later an INR report described continuing military violence. 
It was “unclear whether Jakarta is now committed to restraining the militias it created”, it said.

“Also unclear is whether the current rampages are part of a campaign to derail the process or reflect a last gasp by gangs who fear the military will abandon them.” 
Numerous documents reported on the military-backed militias and their “scorched earth” attacks on East Timor, including leaving Dili “looted, gutted, and gone”. 
The US was pushed into more decisive action and on 9 September Bill Clinton suspended US military relations and assistance with Indonesia. 
Behind closed doors Admiral Dennis Blair met with Wiranto, describing the US as a “friend” to Indonesia, urging him to accept a multinational force, noting Indonesia would still control the territory until they arrived. 
Members of Interfet began arriving in late September, and killings continued despite Interfet’s presence, as TNI soldiers burned and murdered on their way out. 
Just 10 days after Interfet arrived, Cohen sat down with Wiranto. 
“Having let Interfet in, the TNI after 24 years in Timor was not going to immediately internalise the new reality,” Fernandes said. “Hence Cohen’s warning that Indonesia must not interfere with Interfet’s work. Institutions especially authoritarian ones like the TNI don’t turn around monolithically.” 
TNI backed off and Interfet was able to hand over to the UN transitional administration the next month."
119,terror,Hotel Mumbai review – queasy terrorism drama,"For its pace, energy and thriller panache, this dramatisation of the terrorist attacks that bloodied the city of Mumbai in 2008 might be admired. Still, there is something queasy about mining such fresh real-life trauma for popcorn entertainment. At times, it feels like Mission: Impossible, with its glamorous, five-star hotel setting and a ticking timebomb set piece involving a crying baby. Mostly though, it’s quite unpleasant, watching bodies torn apart by grenades and machine guns. An ensemble piece that moves between the terrorists and the victims, in the film’s more interesting moments, it affords the terrorists (played by Amandeep Singh and Kapil Kumar Netra) small flashes of humour. Rather than cartoon villains, they are witless, brainwashed teenagers who marvel at the posh hotel’s high-end toilets. Weirdly, its straight-backed heroes (played by Dev Patel and Armie Hammer) are drawn with less nuance.           Watch a trailer for Hotel Mumbai. "
120,terror,"Bayonne mosque attack was terrorism, says survivors' lawyer","A lawyer for two men who were injured in an attack on a mosque in south-west France this week has said the case should be treated as terrorism. Méhana Mouhou, who represents two men aged 74 and 78 who were shot when they disturbed the suspect trying to set fire to the mosque in Bayonne, said: “This was a terrorist act.” Claude Sinke, 84, a former far-right supporter, has been charged with attempted murder, arson and gun violence but not terrorism offences. Mouhou said the charges were a “masquerade” and a result of “judiciary ineptitude”, and he has sought a meeting with the state prosecutor to push for the case to be reclassified. He said: “There were preparatory acts in which he observed the mosque. His motives were clear. Everyone in his entourage says he was Islamophobic and racist. There was a gas canister, arms and targeting. So he was perfectly aware of what he was doing.” Sinke, who once stood as a local election candidate for Marine Le Pen’s far-right party Front National (now renamed National Rally), was arrested at his home shortly after the attack on Monday. He was accused of shooting the two men – one in the neck and the other in the chest – and setting fire to a car near the mosque before he fled in his own car. Police said he had admitted the crimes. Investigators said Sinke wanted to set fire to the mosque to avenge the fire that tore through the roof of Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris in April, which he blamed on Muslims. Paris police are treating the Notre-Dame fire as accidental and there has been no suggestion of arson or any connection to Muslims. Sinke was put through two days of psychological tests to determine whether he understood what he had done. The state prosecutor in Bayonne had suggested there were questions about Sinke’s mental health, but it was decided he could be held criminally responsible. He has been detainedand if convicted he could face life imprisonment. Sinke left Front National in 2015 when his local federation removed him for comments found to be “against the spirit and political line” of the party. Mike Bresson, the deputy mayor of Sinke’s home village, Saint-Martin-de-Seignanx, said Sinke was known for his “verbal excesses”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, described the mosque attack as “heinous”. France has been grappling with calls by some on the right to ban Muslim mothers in headscarves from volunteering on school trips. This month 90 personalities, including actors and writers, signed an open letter in Le Monde calling on Macron “to say with force that Muslim women, whether they wear a headscarf or not, and Muslims in general have a place in our society – and to refuse our fellow Muslim citizens being monitored, stigmatised or denounced for the practice of their religion”."
121,terror,Families of Manchester terror victims ‘must declare valuables’ to get legal aid,"Relatives of the 22 victims of the Manchester Arena terrorist attack who are applying for legal aid for representation at the forthcoming inquest are being made to fill in a 17-page questionnaire and declare whether they have any “valuable possessions” worth more than £500 that could be sold to help cover costs. Campaign groups have attacked the legal aid application process – which may still end in claims being rejected – as “cruel and intrusive”. They back calls for families whose loved ones are killed in terrorist attacks to automatically receive legal aid for inquests rather than be forced through the means-testing process. “The funding process is intrusive and protracted and adds further trauma,” said Deborah Coles, director of the Inquest charity, which supports bereaved families. “The Ministry of Justice perpetuates the myth that inquests are informal and families can represent themselves. This is dishonest and fails to confront the reality of the uneven playing field that confronts families at complex inquests.” The police, emergency and security services will receive taxpayer-funded representation when the inquest into the Manchester bombing of May 2017 starts next April. But insufficient legal representation for the victims’ families has prompted concerns that key questions may go unanswered. “Families face multiple state lawyers, paid for at public expense, who frequently put defence of their interests above the search for the truth,” Coles said. “The past few years have seen an unprecedented focus on how agencies investigate contentious deaths and there have been repeated calls for reform so families have automatic access to legal aid for inquests. This inequality … is the single greatest obstacle to bereaved families.” Families of the eight victims killed in the 2017 London Bridge attack learned last month – just as the inquest was wrapping up – that they will not receive legal aid. However, it emerged that the widow of the attack’s ringleader, Khuram Butt, was entitled to public funding. Among the questions the Manchester Arena families will have to answer when applying for legal aid is whether they own a car or a timeshare, and whether they have children or a partner in employment. Further detailed guidance issued with the application reveals that articles of value must also be considered. “Examples might be where the individual collects antiques or owns a valuable painting. Items of jewellery are included, save for engagement, wedding or eternity rings, which are disregarded. The individual is asked to declare the value of such items in their application and may be required to provide evidence of value.”     The 22 victims of the Manchester Arena terror attack. Photograph: GMP/PA    James Hodder, the partner of Kirsty Boden, a nurse who was killed in the London Bridge attack while aiding others, has launched a petition calling for bereaved families of terrorist attacks to be entitled to legal aid. It has gathered more than 250,000 signatures. He described filling in the legal aid application form as horrendous. “I had to provide evidence that me and Kirsty were a couple as we were not married. When you are vulnerable and grieving, that’s the last thing you want to do.” It was not until the last week of the inquest that Hodder learned his application for legal aid had been rejected. Fortunately, a law firm provided pro-bono representation. “The official reason they give is that an inquest is not adversarial in nature so there is no need for legal representation, but that doesn’t make any sense as they gave legal aid to the perpetrator’s family. And there are adversarial elements: witnesses are cross-examined in great detail, there are complex arguments made. Weeks of CCTV footage and tens of thousands of pages of documents had to be studied by my legal team.” In May, a letter from the justice committee to David Gauke, who was then justice secretary, said it was “fundamentally unfair for public bodies to have legal representation at the highest level of expertise while bereaved families are unrepresented”. Coles said: “The treatment of terrorist victims is cruel and inhumane and is symptomatic of the dysfunctional and unfair process for funding family representation at inquests.” Figures obtained from the Ministry of Justice via a freedom of information request show that, in 2017, the department spent £4.2m representing prison officers at inquests, while bereaved families received only £92,000 in legal aid. A ministry spokesman said: “We understand how distressing the inquest process will be for relatives of those who died in the Manchester Arena bombing, and we’re making changes to ensure there is more legal support … Aid has always been means-tested and rightly counts not just a person’s income or savings but expensive assets like sports cars, antiques and jewellery. It is possible for the Legal Aid Agency to waive the means test if appropriate."
122,terror,Father of British YPG volunteer in Syria arrested over terrorism offences,"The father of a British man volunteering with the Kurdish-led YPG forces in Syria fighting Islamic State has been arrested and  bailed pending further enquiries related to terrorism offences in what is believed to be the first such case in the UK. Police arrived at the Solihull home of Paul Newey, 49, on 11 December with a warrant and proceeded to search his flat and seize laptops and mobile phones. Newey was arrested and taken to a police station for questioning, along with his 18-year-old son Sam, who was also threatened with arrest.The pair were questioned for 13 hours about Newey’s elder son Dan Newey, 27, who left the UK in 2017 and travelled to north-eastern Syria to join the YPG (People’s Protection Units) – a Kurdish-led force supported by western countries in the five-year battle against Isis. Newey returned to Syria in October, after Turkey launched an attack on the YPG. Newey was held for four days and released on bail.Newey said police also visited the Nuneaton home of Newey’s mother, Vikki, on 11 December, without a warrant, and told her she would be arrested if she did not voluntarily attend a police station for questioning. She was interviewed for around 12 hours before being released.     YPG members and Syrian Kurds take part in a demonstration in the town of Amuda, Syria, in January 2018. Photograph: Delil Souleiman/AFP via Getty Images    The case marks the first time a Briton has been investigated for terrorism offences related to a family member joining the YPG, a group which the UK has aided with training, weapons and ground troop support as part of the US-led international coalition against Isis.Newey, who was previously investigated and placed on a watchlist but not charged with any crimes when he returned home in March 2018, said in a series of messages from Syria that he was worried the case would set a precedent for other families. “On the one hand Britain supports the YPG militarily as part of the international coalition and on the other hand it is actively persecuting people that have anything to do with it. I have no idea why [the police] have arrested my father and questioned my brother or mother. My actions are mine alone. Because they can’t get to me, they are targeting my family,” he said.“If I’m lucky enough to survive whatever happens here, then I will go home and I will take whatever ‘punishment’ they give me.”West Midlands police confirmed a 49-year-old man in Solihull was arrested on suspicion of funding and supporting terrorism and had been bailed pending further inquiries.The YPG is not banned under UK terrorism legislation. However, several UK nationals who have joined the group have been arrested or charged in connection to the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), a movement based in Turkey and Iraq closely allied to the YPG. The PKK is considered a terrorist organisation by the UK and several other countries.Aidan James from Merseyside, 29, who trained with the PKK in Iraq to fight alongside Kurdish units, was jailed for four years in a landmark case last month.He was cleared of attending a place of terrorism training with the YPG across the border in Syria due to the YPG working with British support to defend the Kurdish people against the threat of Isis forces.Similar charges against former soldier James Matthews, 43, from Dalston, London, were dropped last year.Another former soldier, Daniel Burke, 32, was remanded in custody on 20 December on two counts of preparing acts of terrorism, one of which relates to an allegation he organised transport for Newey to travel to Iraq from Barcelona. “Material support” for terrorism, a charge Newey’s father could face, has been commonly used to prosecute family members and friends of Britons who joined Isis.Funding terrorism carries a maximum sentence of 14 years but shorter sentences have been handed down for small sums of money transferred from family members to relatives in Syria.In the most high-profile case, in June this year John Letts and Sally Lane of Oxford were found guilty of sending their son £223 in September 2015 when he was in Syria, despite concerns he had joined Isis. The couple were sentenced to 15 months in prison suspended for 12 months.Earlier this month a woman in Liverpool was found guilty of sending £35 to her husband in Syria, a self-styled “independent fighter”. Another woman, a friend, had already pleaded guilty over £46. Both are due to be sentenced soon.The status of international YPG volunteers has become more complicated since Kurdish-led forces dismantled the last slivers of Isis’s so-called caliphate in March. Since then, Donald Trump has announced the withdrawal of US troops in the area who acted as a buffer between the YPG and Turkey, and Turkey subsequently launched a large attack over its border on the YPG.As a result, British volunteers with the YPG are now for the most part fighting against a Nato ally and its proxy Syrian rebel forces.In May 2019, Sajid Javid, then UK home secretary, warned all British citizens in Kurdish-held north-east Syria to leave within 28 days or face a 10-year prison sentence if they attempted to return to the UK, adding that security officials were “urgently” reviewing whether to tighten rules about travel to the region.If introduced, the policy would be the first use of new powers given to the home secretary in the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act, which became law in February.A rise in arrests and charges brought against Britons with links to the YPG has led to speculation the Home Office is considering the group for inclusion on the proscribed terrorist organisation list. The department said it did not comment on the decision-making process.Hundreds of international volunteers have travelled to Syria since 2014 to fight alongside Kurdish forces. At least seven British nationals have been killed while with the YPG.  This article was amended on 27 December 2019 because an earlier version stated incorrectly that Paul Newey had been charged with support for terrorism and material support for terrorism under the Terrorism Act 2000. He was arrested on suspicion of funding/supporting terrorism, but has not been charged. "
123,terror,Home secretary Priti Patel criticised over wish for criminals ‘to feel terror’,"The new home secretary, Priti Patel, has been criticised after she said she wants criminals “to literally feel terror” once she begins her law and order reforms. Patel indicated a sharp rightward turn in the government’s approach to crime, which comes after Boris Johnson, the prime minister, announced plans to recruit 20,000 new police officers. “I fundamentally think the Conservative party is the party of law and order. Full stop,” Patel told the Daily Mail, in her first interview since Johnson appointed her home secretary. She vowed to “empower [police] to stop criminality.”   Related: Priti Patel's record on human rights prompts 'extreme concern'    “My focus now is restating our commitment to law and order and restating our commitment to the people on the frontline, the police,” Patel said. “I’ve always felt the Conservative party is the party of the police and police officers … quite frankly, with more police officers out there and greater police presence, I want [criminals] to literally feel terror at the thought of committing offences.” Responding on Saturday, the shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Patel’s “tough rhetoric” would not end “soaring crime”. “We need more officers and resources for the police to work with our communities, not to risk alienating them with draconian powers,” she said. The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Ed Davey called Patel, the MP for Witham, Essex, “out of touch”.  “Priti Patel’s notion that making people terrified of the police will cut crime shows just how out of touch she is with what’s leading some young people into crime in the first place,” Davey said. “So often, young people say they carry knives because they are afraid of other young people in gangs. We need more police so these young people can feel less afraid as they now trust the police to be there, not because the police add to their fears.” The appointment is a reversal of fortunes for Patel, who was sacked from the government two years ago after breaking the ministerial code by secretly and unofficially meeting Israeli ministers, businesspeople and a senior lobbyist. One of 30 Tory Brexit ultras who voted against the former prime minister Theresa May’s EU deal at every opportunity, Patel’s elevation to the Home Office is regarded as a key component of what political commentators are calling the most rightwing cabinet since the Thatcher years. Patel indicated a return to a hard line on drugs offences after some forces had apparently not been taking action on possession.   Related: Priti Patel accused of breaching ministerial code for second time    “Any form of drug use – you don’t turn a blind eye to it at all. It has a corrosive impact on people and communities,” she said. The Lib Dems accused Patel of “rank hypocrisy” over the zero-tolerance approach, considering a series of admissions from senior Tory colleagues. Johnson promoted Michael Gove to the cabinet after he was forced to admit using cocaine 20 years ago at social events. Dominic Raab was made the foreign secretary and Andrea Leadsom the business secretary after saying they had used cannabis as students. The Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine, who has worked for access to medicinal cannabis, called for a “pragmatic, evidence-based approach” to drugs. “It’s rank hypocrisy for the home secretary to take such an archaic approach on cannabis given the recent admissions from members of the cabinet she sits around,” she said. “The war on drugs has been an unmitigated failure. In reality, by decriminalising cannabis we can remove it from the criminal market and protect vulnerable young people.” Human rights activists have reacted with alarm at Patel’s new job, which puts her in charge of crime and policing, counterterrorism and drugs policy. Patel, whose Gujarati Indian parents migrated to the UK in the 1960s from Uganda just before Idi Amin’s decision to deport all Asians, has voted for a stricter asylum system, stronger enforcement of immigration rules, and against banning the detention of pregnant women in immigration jails. However, she distanced herself from her past comments on the death penalty, despite telling a Question Time audience in 2011 that she would support its reintroduction. “I have never said I’m an active supporter of it and [what I said] is constantly taken out of context,” she told the Mail, adding that her comments on Question Time “may have been clipped”. She told the Question Time audience: “I do actually think when we have a criminal justice system that continuously fails in this country and where we have seen murderers, rapists and people who have committed the most abhorrent crimes in society, go into prison and then are released from prison to go out into the community to then reoffend and do the types of crime they have committed again and again. “I think that’s appalling. And actually on that basis alone I would actually support the reintroduction of capital punishment to serve as a deterrent.”"
124,terror,'Fishwrap' fake news campaign recycles old news of terror attacks,"An online misinformation campaign has been turning old news stories into fresh fake news, according to the threat analytics firm Recorded Future. While the identity of those running the campaign is unknown, the group has been dubbed “Fishwrap” by Recorded Future’s chief technology officer Staffan Truvé “since it uses old news for new purposes”. The Fishwrap campaign was discovered while monitoring social media platforms for reports of terror attacks. In the process, a network of more than 200 accounts was discovered that were talking about attacks not reported elsewhere – attacks which, on closer inspection, were supported by links to real news stores about historical attacks. “They were talking about them as though they were new, but linking back to the old news stories,” Truvé said. “These could have all been independent, but then we found that they were all using a family of URL shorteners. And all these URL shorteners were running on an anonymous Azure service. So this made us understand that this was a larger campaign.”   Related: Why we're making the age of our journalism clearer at the Guardian    The report claims: “The fact that the operation has been going on for close to a year, and that it is spending money on numerous domains on dedicated servers, leads us to believe this is not just someone running the operation ‘for the lulz’, but rather a political organisation and/or nation state with an intent to spread fear &amp; uncertainty, and track followers of the posted links.” The accounts shared “news” about incidents such as the 2015 Paris terror attacks but with the date and other context removed in an apparent attempt to make the news go viral a second time. “There are two candidates here,” Truvé said. “It’s either a state-sponsored misinformation campaign, or it’s a domestic alt-right thing, because it is focused on terror events to do with Muslims. Or it could be what we call ‘operational preparedness’ – they’re up, active, creating history for themselves and their accounts, and then they want to use it in the future to spread original fake news.” But without specific information about the users that only the social networks have access to, Recorded Future cannot be more definite in its attribution. “Whichever way this is set up – they’re not breaking any laws, they’re not breaking even the terms of use of Twitter,” Truvé said. Misinformation campaigns, also known as “influence operations”, frequently use a combination of technical and societal factors in an attempt to spread propaganda. For instance, a computer vulnerability may be exploited to register hundreds or thousands of fake accounts, which are then deployed to influence curation algorithms and boost a particular news story or topic."
125,terror,Bolivia's interim government accuses Evo Morales of terrorism and sedition,"Bolivia’s rightwing interim government has turned up the heat on former president Evo Morales, accusing him of committing acts of terrorism and sedition by fanning street protests and blockades. The country’s new interior minister, Arturo Murillo, announced on Friday that he had asked the public prosecutor’s office to open an investigation into Morales after the release of an audio recording supposedly showing the exiled leftist orchestrating plans for roadblocks designed to suffocate the country’s main city, La Paz.   Related: 'What happened was a massacre': grief and rage in Bolivia after day of deadly violence    Morales, who resigned under pressure from the military and protesters on 10 November, has described the recording as “fake”, but protests by his supporters have piled pressure on the interim president, Jeanine Áñez, a former senator. On Friday a representative of Bolivia’s anti-drug trafficking council claimed drug money was being used to finance an “insurrection” against Bolivia’s new government – but offered no proof for the claim. “Evo Morales is an international criminal,” Leonardo Roca claimed on national TV. An editorial in the conservative newspaper Página Siete said on Friday: “No one doubts that Evo Morales has genuine support … but there is also ample evidence that the protests seeking to return him to power have degenerated into using violent methods. “The most serious thing is that Evo Morales himself directs these protest from exile,” it added. Two weeks after Morales fled the country, his followers have mobilized across the country, throwing up hundreds of roadblocks to prevent fuel and food reaching Bolivia’s de facto capital and thus force concessions – perhaps even Morales’s return. The protests have already started to bite, causing shortages of food and fuel – and huge queues outside bread shops and petrol stations. Authorities have been forced to mount an airlift, transporting some 1,400 tonnes of food to the besieged cities of La Paz, El Alto, Oruro and Sucre. Bolivia has been in upheaval since Morales proclaimed himself the winner of a 20 October election despite widespread allegations of electoral fraud. Thirty-two people have been killed. Morales alleges that he was the victim of a coup d’état and has been granted asylum in Mexico. On Friday, Áñez pleaded with protesters to end a blockade at a natural gas plant that supplies La Paz.   Related: Bolivia funeral procession turns violent – in pictures    “I ask for reflection from brothers who are carrying out this unnecessary blockade,” she said. “We’re all Bolivians. You can’t punish the city of La Paz.” Eight people died in clashes with the military outside the gas plant on Tuesday. Two days later, thousands of Morales supporters carried the coffins of the dead into La Paz, where police fired teargas at them. Áñez reiterated that she will only stay in power long enough for there to be new elections. But her critics say her cabinet have overstepped the bounds of a caretaker government by making changes to foreign policy and threatening to punish Morales’s allies."
126,terror,"Republican Matt Shea 'participated in act of domestic terrorism', says report","The Republican Washington state representative Matthew Shea “participated in an act of domestic terrorism against the United States” and represents a threat of political violence, according to a report produced for the Washington state legislature. Shea is a far-right figure who holds extremist Christian, nationalist and Islamophobic beliefs. The report said it had made the judgment over terrorism by his actions before and during an armed takeover and standoff at the Malheur national wildlife refuge in 2016 in Oregon. The report further contends that in a document entitled the Biblical Basis for War, Shea “advocated the replacement of US democracy with a theocracy and the killing of all males who do not agree”.   Related: Revealed: Republican lawmaker aided group training young men for 'biblical warfare'    In its conclusion, while commenting that Shea is not an “imminent direct threat … it is more probable than not that Representative Shea is likely to plan, direct and engage in additional future conflicts that could carry with them significant risk of bloodshed and loss of life”. It adds: “Representative Shea presents a present and growing threat of risk to others through political violence.” In response to the report, the Washington Republican state legislative minority leader, JT Wilcox, announced on Twitter that Shea had been suspended from the house Republican caucus. The report was commissioned by the house and produced by an outside agency, the Rampart Group, following reporting from the Guardian and other local and national outlets on Shea’s activities. It says Shea “planned the 2016 takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge; engaged in the conflict by directing Cows (Coalition of Western States) members and militias in support of the takeover; and traveled to Burns, Oregon, and met with refuge armed occupiers contrary to appeals and warnings from law enforcement and Oregon state elected officials”. The occupation of the wildlife refuge near Burns lasted 41 days in January and February 2016. During that time one of the occupiers, LaVoy Finicum, was shot dead at a roadblock by Oregon state police. The report says that Shea “participated in a total of four meetings with [occupation leader] Ammon Bundy that took place within three to five days in advance of the armed takeover”, meetings which were corroborated by three witnesses. The report implicates other Republican politicians from western states in Shea’s activities during the occupation. On the first day of the occupation, Shea circulated a “military style operations plan”, codenamed “Operation Cold Reality”, via encrypted email to Cows members. They included the Idaho state representative Heather Scott, the Nevada assemblywoman Michele Fiore, Shea associates Anthony Bosworth and Jack Robertson, and Anne Byrd, whose husband, Barry, is the pastor for the secretive, patriot movement-aligned Marble community church in Stevens county, Washington. Shea’s instructions to members of the network included directions to “conduct reconnaissance … collect intelligence on law enforcement and government operations … establish counterintelligence and counter-recon teams”. A major target was the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Shea set out the goal of “putting pressure on federal, state and local officials to address BLM tyranny”, the report said. He continued to communicate with this network via email throughout the occupation. Bosworth later directly participated in the occupation of the federal facility under Shea’s instructions, where he “likely committed criminal acts” including the theft of surveillance cameras. The report further details Shea’s extensive participation in other militant patriot movement activities, including two more confrontations with the federal government – at Bunkerville, Nevada, and Priest River, Idaho. At Bunkerville in 2014, when the Bundy family and their supporters staged an armed confrontation with federal authorities over unpaid grazing fees, the report says Shea first despatched Bosworth to the area, issued a call to arms so that others in the patriot movement would make the journey, and eventually traveled there himself . At this time he also formed the Coalition of Western States, a group of patriot movement-friendly legislators and activists. Throughout the Bunkerville incident, says the report, his actions revealed “evidence of his planning and promoting political violence against employees of the US government and law enforcement officers who were lawfully attempting to execute a federal court order”. The report accuses Shea of participating in or condoning intimidation of political opponents, government officials, and minorities. The evidence for this includes chats between Shea and his associates first reported in the Guardian. It also alleges that Shea engaged in counter-surveillance of law enforcement agencies. At one point Shea emailed a “detailed extensive law enforcement confidential information laying out the command and control structure of Washington state law enforcement agencies”, including “rosters of local FBI joint terrorism taskforce (JTTF) agents, Swat team member lists complete with names and badge numbers and the joint harbor operations command (JHOC) building schematics”. Shea also engaged in militia training for “armed conflicts against federal, state and local governments”. He supported “the training of youth and young adults to fight a holy war”, as previously reported in the Guardian. In a statement, Lindsay Schubiner from the progressive Western States Center urged the House to go even further, writing: “Shea has repeatedly demonstrated that he is unfit for public office, but today’s explosive revelations seal the deal. The Washington House of Representatives must act immediately to hold him accountable. Shea’s egregious and threatening behavior warrant removal from office.” Shea, who rarely talks to reporters, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement issued through his lawyer to Northwest News Network, Shea wrote: “I will not back down. I will continue to fight for our shared values which have made this country such a blessing to the rest of the world.” In a telephone conversation, Jay Pounder, the source of many of the documents which have formed the basis of the Guardian’s reporting and the investigation, said: “I’m glad that the truth has come to light. I hope the legislature does not give this a pass.”"
127,terror,The Sun acts responsibly in reporting terror,"Your article (Mainstream media helping radicalisation, says Met’s anti-terror boss, 21 March) suggested that the Sun “rushed” to upload clips of the footage filmed by the gunman in the horrific attack in Christchurch last week. Quite apart from the implication that we were acting irresponsibly in doing so, the failure to explain to your readers that we did not show any clips of violence creates a misleading impression that we published graphic video of shootings or propaganda. Furthermore, the article fails to note that Brendan Cox – who co-founded Survivors Against Terror – praised our front page last Sunday as a “model of how terror should be covered” and that TellMama, a group which campaigns against hate crime, highlighted that day’s Sun coverage of the attack as “really positive”. It also fails to acknowledge that we called the gunman a “terrorist” as soon as the attack occurred, unlike the Guardian.

128,terror,Home Office proposes offence of possessing terrorist propaganda,"A new offence relating to possession of terrorist propaganda that glorifies or encourages extremism could be introduced to toughen up UK anti-terror laws. The Home Office said it was considering fresh legislation in response to the Prevention of Future Deaths Report by Mark Lucraft QC concerning last year’s inquests into the eight people killed in the 2017 London Bridge terrorist attack. The inquests heard that a police raid on the home of the attack ringleader, Khuram Butt, in October 2016 uncovered Isis propaganda about martyrdom and suicide missions in material recovered from his phone and laptop. However there had been no charges. While legislation forbids distribution of extreme material, possession is only criminal if the material is useful in commission of a terrorist act. In his report, Lucraft, the chief coroner for England and Wales, observed: “It may be impossible to take action even when the material is of the most offensive and shocking character.” Responding on Tuesday, the home secretary, Priti Patel, said discussions were taking place as to whether there was “a gap in the current legislation from an operational perspective”. She said: “The government notes the chief coroner’s comments regarding the evidence at the inquests, the existence of the offence for possession of a prohibited image of a child, and the perception that the lack of a comparative counter-terrorism offence may sometimes prevent counter-terrorism policing from taking disruptive action.” The UK independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Jonathan Hall QC, asked on Twitter for opinions as to whether a new offence were necessary. He said the new offence listing could be useful if framed in the right way. He said: “Whilst propaganda is too slippery a term to be useful in defining a criminal offence, I think there is a good case for focusing on possession of the most violent forms of terrorist imagery such as torture and beheadings,. “It is not always possible to show that a person has disseminated terrorist material, and, for a limited category of material – in the same way that the law prohibits the possession of child sex abuse images or extreme violent pornography it may be sensible to prohibit possession of extreme terrorist material.” He said the prosecution should have to prove the material was produced to encourage or glorify terrorism, and that legislation had to avoid penalising journalists and human rights defenders. But Rosalind Comyn, policy and campaigns officer at Liberty, said such a law was unnecessary. “The UK already has oppressive counter-terror laws which put our freedom to think, debate and learn in jeopardy. Making the law even more heavy handed would undermine our freedom of thought and our right to free expression, without making us any safer. It is critical that the government focuses on creating counter-terror strategies that keep us safe and free, protecting the rights terrorists seek to destroy.” David Gottlieb, a defence lawyer in many high-profile terrorism cases, questioned whether the scope of the new law might be too wide, given the definition of terrorism in the UK.    This might make more sense if the definition of terrorism was not as broad and far-reaching as it currently is:   e.g.  should mere possession of material which might encourage resistance to odious regimes that are not recognised by HMG as legitimate governments be an offence?&mdash; David Gottlieb (@DavidAGottlieb) January 14, 2020    Lucraft, in his report, also raised concerns about the suspension of priority MI5 investigations into Butt. He had been under investigation since 2015 but it was suspended twice, in 2016 and again from 21 March to 4 May 2017, weeks before the attacks. In its response to Lucraft, MI5 defended its suspension mechanism as effective and necessary but accepted a recommendation that the reliability of its potential lone actor assessment tool should be tested. Butt, 27, was the first suspect under active investigation by MI5 who went on to kill. The only other to date was Usman Khan, who killed two people and injured three more beside London Bridge on 29 November last year."
129,terror,Facebook terror crackdown: will Scott Morrison's plan for extremist content work?,"The G20 leaders have urged Facebook and other social media companies to step up their efforts to prevent the wide distribution of terror attacks on their platforms in the wake of the Christchurch massacre. At the summit in Osaka, Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, succeeded in getting the leaders to put out the statement, despite reported hesitation from the Trump administration over free speech concerns. What does it mean for Facebook? In the statement, the leaders urge social media giants like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to “not allow use of their platforms to facilitate terrorism and VECT [violent extremism conducive to terrorism]”. The statement is symbolic, and not a binding statement that forces the tech giants to do anything, or the countries involved to make new laws in this area.   Related: Trade wars, tweets and western liberalism: G20 summit wraps up in Osaka    Australia already legislated in this area, passing “world first” laws in April creating new offences for service providers that fail to remove videos depicting “abhorrent violent conduct” including terrorist acts, murders, torture, rape or kidnapping. The countries party to the statement could begin pressuring Facebook and Twitter by passing Australian-style legislation in their own countries, but there’s nothing in the statement to force them to do so. Morrison said the statement was “a clear warning from global leaders to internet companies that they must step up”. A report released by the Australian government to coincide with the G20 statement is likely to have a much bigger impact on what Facebook and other social media companies do in this area. A taskforce set up by the Australian government with the tech companies and the telecommunications companies in March put together the report based on an agreed set of responses to the livestreaming of the Christchurch attack. What have the social media companies agreed to do? A new user for a social media site will not be able to livestream for a predetermined period (such as the first 24 hours after they create their account). The sites have also agreed to strengthen the hash-sharing database and URL-sharing consortium. This means that when a video like the Christchurch massacre is identified by a URL or the unique code for the video, the social media sites can immediately detect when a user is trying to upload or share it and block it from being shared. They’ll also inform users about how they can report such material and the processes for getting it taken down, and provide clear, efficient appeal processes if something has been taken down by mistake. They will also fund research into how to prevent and counter terrorist material online. What have the telecommunications companies agreed to do? The companies have been blocking sites hosting the Christchurch video since shortly after the attack, and have agreed to keep blocking the sites, and to direct people to a page explaining why the site they’ve tried to visit is blocked. The esafety commissioner is also going to develop a protocol with the telecommunications companies to set out the processes for blocking sites quickly in the event of another terrorist attack being streamed online. How can we be sure it will work next time? Australia and New Zealand have agreed to run a “testing” event in the next 12 months that will simulate a Christchurch-like event. The test will make sure that the new tools the social media companies have put in place and the government processes work as intended. The test-run could, if successful, then be repeated regularly to ensure it is all working properly. Will it be enough? The government has left the door open to legislating even more if the scheme isn’t working as intended.   Related: Australia passes social media law penalising platforms for violent content    “Social media companies are on notice. If they don’t deliver on their commitments, we will move to legislate and do so quickly,” Morrison said. The legislation passed in a matter of days in April before parliament was dissolved for the election has yet to be put to the test. Media companies and tech experts have warned that the legislation was rushed without fully considering the impact it could have on media reporting, or the potential unintended consequences – such as individuals working for the platforms being found liable for what users upload. What does this mean for hate speech and online radicalisation? There is an agreement to fund research to “better understand, prevent and counter terrorist and extreme violent material online” but limited other measures to prevent people from being radicalised online or sharing hate speech. "
130,terror,Think Johnson's 'blue terror' reshuffle means a no-deal exit? Think again,"With the number of cabinet sackings far exceeding the Tory majority in the Commons, Boris Johnson has started his reign as prime minister by unleashing a blue terror. With Dominic Raab as his deputy and foreign secretary and Priti Patel as home secretary, Johnson’s cabinet is the quintessence of remainer nightmares.  Some will say this means an immediate general election is likely, interpreting a sharp pivot to the right as an attempt to outflank Nigel Farage and his Brexit party. These appointments sound the no-deal klaxon so loudly that it will be heard unequivocally in Brussels.   Related: Boris Johnson cabinet: Sajid Javid, Priti Patel and Dominic Raab given top jobs – live news    Yet paradoxically, stuffing his cabinet with members of the European Research Group (ERG) may make a no-deal exit less likely, not more. Members of the new cabinet now have a stake in retaining power and position as well as pursuing ideological purity. Johnson will offer them the chance to negotiate a future free trade deal with both the EU and the US. A chaotic no-deal exit might jeopardise all of that.  And the lesson of the past two decades has been that Farage is always prepared to go one step further to the right than the Tory party, meaning that a general election prior to leaving the EU would be an enormous gamble. So Johnson is, in fact, more likely to attempt a Brexit in name only or “Brino”. This would see the UK exit the political union at the end of October, while for the time being remaining in everything else. That would mean leaving the European council, commission, and parliament while staying in the customs union and single market. It will also mean the continuation of free movement and the UK’s full financial contribution, so that the benefits and burdens are in balance.  The political declaration will then set out a timetable for a Canada-style free trade agreement to be negotiated, with a timeframe of three to five years – a meaningful period for a premiership, a blink of the eye for a generational project such as Brexit. The UK would then cut over from de facto EU membership to the new partnership at that point. This would enable Johnson to claim that he had torn up Theresa May’s near-universally hated withdrawal agreement and avoided the “undemocratic” backstop. The brinkmanship will come over what happens if no free trade deal is concluded in the agreed timeframe. The EU’s opening position will be that the backstop should be revived. But Johnson has three ways to tempt them to concede. First, the money. Such an arrangement would mean Britain pumping in around £60bn to the EU without any control over how it is spent. That may prove tempting for many leaders.  Second, the threat of no deal. After years of burnishing his “madman” credentials and with a cabinet of no-dealers, there is little doubt of the veracity of his “do or die” promise, even if the impact would be felt most acutely by the UK. With the global economy showing signs of slowing, EU leaders know that a no-deal exit could tip the European economy into recession, damaging their own electoral prospects. No matter the country, all politicians are in the business of self-preservation first.  Third, with a five-year time horizon, it means a no-deal exit would be someone else’s problem. There is a good chance he pulls it off. Such an agreement would have serious prospects of passing the Commons since it would probably secure the support of many Labour MPs from leave-supporting constituencies. With much of the ERG in the cabinet, parliamentary opposition from the Tory benches would be far lower than that faced by May. But with a near nonexistent majority, culling such a large number of cabinet ministers also tells us that a general election is probably inevitable this year.  The most brutal reshuffle in decades means that Johnson will be unable to rely on a parliamentary majority for any domestic legislation, whether to pass a finance bill or to fix any of the multitude of problems facing the country. No matter what happens with Brexit, Johnson will be unable to govern for long with so many skilled and vengeful enemies on the backbenches. A general election is the only way to change the parliamentary arithmetic in his favour and diminish the chokehold his Tory opponents have over him. No matter the rhetoric, opposition parties are unlikely to welcome a general election if Johnson delivers Brexit with a deal. The Brexit party’s fox would have been shot and its supporters seduced by cosying up to Trump. Having made stopping Brexit their defining purpose, the Liberal Democrats would be redundant – their pitch as a kinder, gentler, pro-European Toryism rendered irrelevant. Jo Swinson’s defence of the coalition government and ruling out working with Jeremy Corbyn might be seen as costly errors.  The Labour party, too, is in perilous territory, riven by division and facing the prospect of its 2017 coalition dissolving. By prevaricating over Brexit, Corbyn has lost his reputation for “straight-talking, honest politics” and with Brexit over, remainers that supported Labour in 2017 are likely to be more sceptical in a future general election. Johnson’s premiership will mark a decisive break from both the Tory-led coalition and the May government that followed it. Johnson, who was born in the US, seems to draw inspiration from across the Atlantic. It’s not hard to imagine him declaring 1 November as a national holiday (our “independence day” no doubt). Expect him to govern as Republicans do: cutting taxes while maintaining or increasing spending, so exploding the deficit.  Eye-catching announcements on spending on police, defence, education and, of course, £350m a week for the NHS, seem likely. With the UK legally out of the EU, he will surely journey to Washington with great fanfare, opening trade negotiations with Trump in parallel with those with the EU. And perhaps Johnson might even promise to “make Britain great again”, as we go it alone in the world. • Tom Kibasi is director of the Institute for Public Policy Research and chair of the IPPR Commission on Economic Justice.

131,terror,'We have nothing': Papua New Guinea's broken health system braces for Covid-19,"The first that staff at Nonga General Hospital in Papua New Guinea heard that they had been treating someone with coronavirus, was when they saw the country’s prime minister announce it in televised press conference on Monday. They had been treating the patient, a volunteer health worker at the hospital, for pneumonia. She originally came into the hospital in late March, but recovered and was discharged, before her symptoms worsened and she was readmitted. “This person wasn’t put into isolation or even a different ward. She has been walking around freely in the past few days and talking with us, so we are scared. We all left the hospital and are waiting for someone to come and explain what is happening,” said Margaret Melke, a nurse in Rabaul district, where Nonga Hospital is located.     Margaret Melke has been a nurse in East New Britain for more than 40 years. She is also the Union Leader for New Guinea Islands. PNG. East New Britain is a province of Papua New Guinea Photograph: Kalo Fainu/The Guardian    The woman, who is now recovering at her home, is the second confirmed case of Covid-19 in Papua New Guinea, a nation of roughly eight million people, about 150km north of the Australian mainland. The first was an Australian mining worker, who had flown into the country. But this time the infected person is a local, who had not recently travelled abroad. The case was detected in a village near Rabaul, a harbourside town on the island of East New Britain. The prospect of the arrival of coronavirus in a country with just 500 doctors and around 5,000 hospital beds and which struggles to deal with even routine illnesses has terrified the public.     A medicine dispensery at the Warangoi clinic in East New Britain. Photograph: Kalo Fainu/The Guardian    Health workers are asking how the nation’s fractured health system, which routinely leaves clinics without soap or disinfectant and where nurses report using nappies as gauze to mop up blood and rice packets in lieu of gloves, would deal with an outbreak. The country is already dealing with outbreaks of malaria, dengue fever, drug-resistant tuberculosis and polio. “When one [Covid-19 case] is confirmed, it is a disaster for us. It is already an outbreak,” said Melke, who has spent more than 40 years working in Papua New Guinea’s beleaguered health system and is the Nursing Union Leader for New Guinea Islands. “We are the frontline, but we do not have safety equipment to protect us, so how can we save others? We put our own families at risk.” ‘I will look out for them, I can die’ After the case was announced by the prime minister on Monday, staff at Nonga General Hospital walked out of the building, refusing to continue working until they knew more. Deputy chief physician at Nonga Hospital, Dr Alexander Maha, confirmed there was a walkout of staff, but said things settled quickly and staff were given the option to leave if they did not wish to be part of the frontline team. He also said it was protocol for the cases to be announced by the prime minister. Maha says a section of one of the wards has now been cleared and set up as an isolation area for suspected Covid-19 cases.     A woman holds her child as they wait for medicine at the dispensary at Warangoi Helth Clinic. Photograph: Kalo Fainu/The Guardian    “A huge part of what we need to do now is to manage the fear”, explains Dr Maha, “so that others who present with Covid-19 symptoms do not go into hiding. We need them to know that if their results are positive, they are in good hands”. The fear is acute, especially among health workers. Melke says there was a recent suspected case of coronavirus at Nonga Hospital and the patient was transferred multiple times between hospital departments as medical staff fled, too scared to touch the patient. “Finally, one nurse put her hand up, declaring that she would sacrifice herself for the sake of the patient,” said Melke, who recalls the nurse said: “‘Larim mi suicide tasol, mi lukautim em, mi ken dai’ [Let me suicide, I will look out for them, I can die] and she alone nursed the patient.” The patient turned out to have pneumonia and was cleared of Covid-19. ‘There is no medicine’ If anything, the fears are even more acute in rural health clinics, where the resources for nursing staff are even fewer. A two-hour drive from Rabaul on a road strewn with potholes and corrugation, is the rural health clinic at Warangoi, where nurses report working to the point of exhaustion in desperately under-resourced conditions.     The emergency kits in the labour consist of two plastic boxes. Nurses from Warangoi clinic say they do not have enough instruments, PPE or sanitisers for their day to day needs. Photograph: Kalo Fainu/The Guardian    “We struggle with drug shortages, we have endless problems with our facilities and our wards,” says Rosemary Darius, the head nurse at the clinic. “We don’t have proper equipment to treat patients with, our bedding is not in good condition, we don’t have proper instruments or disinfectants to sanitise our instruments - if coronavirus comes here, we will be disabled. We have nothing to disinfect with.”    Sometimes there’s no gloves, so we put our hands in the plastic bags of rice... Even to wash the floor, we don’t have strong detergents, just laundry powder.  Margaret Melke, nurse     Melke used to work at Warangoi clinic. “I ran away because of the problems here. Even for a mother [who] comes to deliver, there is no gauze, there is no IV fluid, there is no medicine to control the bleeding. We use their nappies. We tell them to give us five of their nappies so we can use them to soak up the blood. “I am lucky because my husband works at Nonga Hospital, so I would ask him to smuggle some gauze so when I was on duty I could use it. We tell patients to bring their own lap-lap (sarong) so we can soak up the blood. Sometimes there’s no gloves, so we put our hands in the plastic bags of rice just to protect ourselves. Even to wash the floor, we don’t have strong detergents, just Omo (laundry powder). There’s often not enough sanitiser for the nurses even to wash their own hands.”     Worn and broken gurneys sit outside one of the wards at the Warangoi health clinic in East New Britain, PNG. Photograph: Kalo Fainu/The Guardian    We get our news about the virus from social media It is not surprising that in light of these conditions, healthcare workers like those at Warangoi are apprehensive at the news of a positive Covid-19 case in their district. All the nurses the Guardian spoke to said their families have asked them to stop working as they are scared they will bring the virus back to their villages, or that they might even be chased away. “We are scared because we are the frontliners receiving the patients. PPE is a big need. We don’t have enough resources, and manpower is one of our biggest concerns,” said Anne Tatau, a nurse at Warangoi health clinic. Staff say they lack information and training to help them manage a potentially catastrophic outbreak. Nurses told the Guardian that only higher-level administrative staff have received training since the Covid-19 state of emergency was declared and Tatau says frontline staff “rely on social media, news updates and personal research to inform themselves” about the virus.     Nurses from Warangoi clinic say they do not have enough instruments, PPE or sanitisers for their day to day needs. Photograph: Kalo Fainu/The Guardian    Maha, the deputy chief physician at Nonga General Hospital, disputes these claims, saying health workers across the region have been given the opportunity to undertake training by an infection control nurse, but that: “No one turns up.” Health minister Jelta Wong said on Wednesday that swift and aggressive measures had been put in place to stop the spread of infection in East New Britain, his home province, including rapid response teams composed of epidemiologists, doctors, nurses, and infection prevention and control specialists. Contract tracing has begun and the affected woman’s village is under lockdown, with police officers stationed around it. Although Maha believes he has the right team, and enough PPE and medical supplies to handle an outbreak in East New Britain, he admits that at times the health system does face some challenges. “We have been improvising for 20 years, but we’ve always managed,” he said."
132,terror,Australian retiree convicted of terrorism and jailed for 12 years in Vietnam,"A Sydney retiree has been convicted of terrorism and jailed for 12 years by a Vietnamese court, in a judgment human rights advocates have described as “essentially a death sentence”. Chau Van Kham, 70, was convicted and sentenced at his first appearance in the people’s court of Ho Chi Minh City after more than 10 months in detention. Chau, whose health has deteriorated badly in detention, was convicted over his membership of the Viet Tan political party, a movement critical of the Vietnamese government that the government has proscribed as a terrorist organisation. Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security said in a statement Chau was convicted of holding a senior position in the New South Wales chapter of Viet Tan, for “financing terrorism” and for recruiting new members to the movement. The court also ordered Chau be deported after serving his sentence.   Related: Terrorist claim against Australian man in Vietnam ‘absolutely false’, his wife says    In a statement Chau’s family said they were “distraught” at the heavy sentence. “His is 70 years old with frail health and no immediate family in Vietnam. We will pursue all avenues of appeal on the severity of the sentence.” Chau’s family said they had not been allowed any direct access or contact with him since his arrest, even at his trial. Only one family member was allowed access to the court. “We urge the Australian government to speak with the Vietnamese authorities to protect an aged Australian citizen’s rights and interests.” Chau was convicted in a judge-only trial amid tight security, with only approved people allowed in the courtroom. Despite sweeping economic reforms and an increasing openness to social change, Vietnam’s ruling Communist party retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate political criticism from either within or outside Vietnam. “At the trial, Chau said he loves Vietnam and doesn’t have any intention to carry out terrorism activities in the country,” the lawyer Nguyen Van Mieng said. “The prosecutors stuck to the idea that he’s a member of Viet Tan to charge him with terrorism. The jail terms for political prisoners are getting longer and longer,” he said. Human Rights Watch’s deputy Asia director, Phil Robertson, said that by sentencing Chau to 12 years in prison, “Vietnam has handed down what is essentially a death sentence on him”. “Given the harsh and unforgiving conditions in Vietnam’s prisons, he will face huge challenges to survive his entire sentence. He has been incarcerated on bogus, politically motivated charges that demonstrate just how fearful Vietnam is about people exercising their rights and demanding genuine democracy. “He should be released immediately and unconditionally, and allowed to return to his family in Australia.”  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning        According to the police statement before the court, Chau entered Vietnam from Cambodia in January this year when he gave US$400 to a man named Nguyen Van Vien to fund the operations of Viet Tan. He was also travelling on false documents. “This is a very serious case of national security infringement led by Viet Tan’s key people,” the statement said. Chau, while an outspoken campaigner for democratic reform in Vietnam, has consistently denied all charges of terrorism or plotting to overthrow the government. In a statement published last week, Viet Tan dismissed the case as a “sham trial”. “Viet Tan will continue to support human rights defenders on the ground. Chau Van Kham entered Vietnam to gain first-hand insight into the human rights situation in the country,” the organisation’s chairman, Do Hoang Diem, said. The Australia director of Human Rights Watch, Elaine Pearson, said Chau’s sentence was “extremely harsh”. “Twelve years is a shocking sentence for anyone, but especially for a 70-year-old man with health problems who according to the court indictment is not accused of violent activity but just being a member of Viet Tan and peacefully opposing the government. This is extremely harsh.   Related: Morrison urged to address human rights on Vietnam visit after calling nation 'free'    “The Australian government should redouble its efforts to free Chau Van Kham and call out Vietnamese authorities for its repeated prosecuting of people who peacefully criticise the government.” Chau, an Australian citizen, was born in Vietnam and served in the army of the Republic of Vietnam before 1975. After the war, he was sent to a re-education camp for three years, before he fled Vietnam by boat, arriving in Australia in 1983. Chau has been a member of Viet Tan since 2010. In the 1980s, Viet Tan advocated for the toppling of the communist government through popular uprising, but in recent years it has explicitly “rejected the use of violence”, stating the organisation is “convinced that nonviolent means are most effective for generating maximum civic participation … to contribute to Vietnam’s modernisation and reform”. Viet Tan was proscribed as a terrorist group by the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security in 2016. Chau was arrested in January alongside the Vietnamese citizens Nguyen Van Vien, 48, and 20-year-old Tran Van Quyen, who are also reportedly members of Viet Tan and who are also facing terrorism charges. The Guardian has approached Australia’s minister for foreign affairs, Marise Payne, for comment."
133,terror,Manchester Arndale stabbings: man arrested on suspicion of terrorism,"A man has been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences after several people were stabbed in Manchester’s Arndale shopping centre, sending bystanders running for their lives. 
Three people were stabbed and taken to hospital after the attack on Friday morning, police said. Two other people were assessed, one was treated at the scene and the other later went to hospital with a superficial wound. 
The suspect, 40, was seen shouting and behaving erratically, bystanders said. He was later arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences and was being investigated for the preparation and instigation of an act of terrorism. 
Police said he had been assessed by specialist doctors and compulsorily detained under the Mental Health Act. They said they did not believe there was any wider threat to the community and it was thought he acted alone. 
Greater Manchester police assistant chief constable Russ Jackson said a man had entered the shopping centre at 11am armed with a large knife. “He entered Exchange Court and lunged at and attacked people with the knife. Two community support officers were in Exchange Court and attempted to confront the attacker. 
“He chased them with the knife as they called for assistance. He attacked people around him and we understood that five people were injured, although thankfully none [of the injuries] are life-threatening.” 
Jackson said the man was apprehended within five minutes and was initially arrested for serious assault and taken into custody. He was later rearrested under terrorism offences. 
“We don’t know the motivation for the attack. It was brutal and extremely frightening for everyone who witnessed it. We don’t believe anyone else was involved, but we are keeping it under review,” he added. 
The investigation into the attack was focusing on whether the suspect was incited by Islamist propaganda and how big a part mental health issues may have the played.  
The man arrested was not believed to have previously known to counter-terrorism authorities. He was not on a list of 3,000 current subjects of interest run by MI5 or their list of 20,000 former subjects of interest. 
Sources stressed the motives in the case seemed initially harder to discern than normal and that the investigation was at a very early stage in understanding what drove the attack. 
Police have asked the public for any images or footage that may have been taken at the scene and said anyone who may have information that could assist the investigation should call 0161 856 0394. 
Witnesses described people screaming and “running for their lives” after the man was seen shouting and using racial epithets near the Superdry store in the shopping centre. 
Janet Loudon, 21, and a friend, who wanted to remain anonymous, had just met up when they heard a disturbance outside the Arndale. Loudon said she came out of work at 10.30am and encountered a black man shouting racial slurs including the N-word and being hostile towards an Arndale worker, who was also black. 
“It wasn’t clear what the man was saying but he was swearing and telling the public, ‘I’m going to fuck you up,’ repeatedly and he got more and more agitated. He was pointing at the police and Arndale workers,” she said, adding that he claimed he was being targeted because of his race and referred to himself using the N-word. 
“Everyone was panicking and frantic. We saw a victim slouched between an ATM which was a horrific sight and she was taken away to be helped.” 
A 19-year-old woman, another woman for whom no age was given and a man in his 50s were taken to hospital with stab wounds.  
A fourth victim – a woman in her 40s who was not stabbed – did not need to go to hospital following assessment by paramedics. Another woman has since gone to hospital with a superficial wound. 
 
 Manchester Arndale centre 
 
Video footage and photographs showed armed police officers deployed around the Exchange Square side of the shopping centre. One clip showed officers using a Taser and holding a man to the ground before arresting him. 
John Greenhalgh, 30, who captured the footage, was travelling on a tram when it stopped suddenly. “You could tell it was something quite serious,” he said. “There were a lot of armed police. They were there very quickly. 
“The tram was evacuated and we were put in the back of a van. We weren’t told what was happening. There was a guy sitting on the floor screaming.” 
In other video and pictures posted on Twitter, a large number of emergency service vehicles were seen arriving at the centre. Footage showed people being taken away on stretchers, and members of the public were asked to stay away from the centre. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
Armed police officers wearing face coverings were stationed outside the centre as a long queue of ambulances arrived and a police helicopter hovered overhead. Plainclothes detectives arrived at the scene while uniformed officers told people the Arndale would be closed for some time. 
Bernadette Westhall, 55, said she saw people “running for their lives” and screaming as the attack unfolded. She was in the toilets on the ground floor near a Starbucks cafe when she heard a commotion. “I was coming out of there and everybody was just screaming and running for their lives. I ran straight into a shop and stayed in there until the coast was clear. It was a lady that he attacked.” 
Shazia Asif, 40, a carer from Oldham, said: “I was upstairs shopping in the Next. I looked down to outside the Starbucks and saw a woman had been stabbed. There was a lot of blood. 
“Somebody had a scarf around her arm – I think she had been stabbed in the arm. They then said, ‘Get out.’ I was just shocked. I didn’t see anyone running away.”

One man, who did not wish to be named, was working in a fire and security services office across the road from the Arndale and spotted police detaining a man with a knife just before the alarm was raised about the stabbings. 
He said: “They pinned a guy against a wall. Then I saw a policewoman with them holding a foot-long knife in a tube – I didn’t see if it had blood on it. It was about 12 inches long and looked like a machete.” 
On Friday afternoon a cordon remained around the shopping centre as forensic teams searched the area. Shops in the centre remained closed as some workers were allowed back in to collect their personal belongings."
134,terror,Hanukah stabbings: five wounded in 'act of domestic terrorism' in New York state,"An attacker armed with a long knife or machete stabbed five people during Hanukah festivities at a rabbi’s home in New York state in what Governor Andrew Cuomo has called “an act of domestic terrorism”.

The Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council said an attacker wearing a scarf fled after stabbing the victims at a house in Monsey, Rockland county, about 30 miles north of New York City, on Saturday night. 
All five victims were taken to hospital, the council said, and two were in critical condition with one of them stabbed at least six times. The rabbi’s son was reported to be among the injured. 
The suspect, Grafton Thomas, 38, from nearby Greenwood Lake, escaped the scene in a vehicle and drove to Manhattan, where he was later arrested in Harlem. He was reportedly covered in blood when apprehended. 
Thomas was charged with five counts of attempted murder and one count of burglary. At his arraignment on Sunday morning, he pleaded not guilty to all charges. 
The stabbings came after a string of incidents targeting Jews in the region, including a deadly antisemitic shooting at a kosher grocery store in the neighboring state of New Jersey earlier this month. New York City increased its police presence in some Brooklyn neighborhoods with large Jewish populations after a series of antisemitic incidents last week. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
The attack took place at the home of Rabbi Chaim Rottenberg, who leads the adjacent synagogue. Dozens of people were reportedly in the house for a candle lighting ceremony on the seventh day of Hanukah. 
“I was praying for my life,” Aron Kohn, 65, who was inside the house when the attack took place, told the New York Times. “He started attacking people right away as soon as he came in the door. We didn’t have time to react at all.” 
“We saw him pull a knife out of a case,” Kohn added. “It was about the size of a broomstick.” 
Yisroel Kraus, a 26-year-old teacher who escaped out the back, told the Washington Post the house had been emptying when the attacker arrived. 
“If he had come 10 minutes earlier, the place would have been packed,” he said. “No way to move; no way to run. It was a miracle. It was a Hanukah miracle.” 
Visiting Monsey on Sunday morning, New York governor Cuomo said the attack was “about the thirteenth incident of antisemitism” in the state of New York over recent weeks, and described the climate of intolerance as “an American cancer in the body politic”.

He said: “This is violence spurred by hate. It is mass violence and I consider this an act of domestic terrorism. Let’s call it what it is.” 
In a statement overnight, he said: “Let me be clear: antisemitism and bigotry of any kind are repugnant to our values of inclusion and diversity and we have absolutely zero tolerance for such acts of hate.” 
The New York attorney general, Letitia James, said she was “deeply disturbed” by the situation in Monsey. “There is zero tolerance for acts of hate of any kind and we will continue to monitor this horrific situation.” 
Donald Trump, who has stoked intolerance during his time in the White House, was at his golf club in Florida on Sunday. He wrote on Twitter: “The anti-Semitic attack in Monsey, New York, on the 7th night of Hanukkah last night is horrific. We must all come together to fight, confront, and eradicate the evil scourge of anti-Semitism. Melania and I wish the victims a quick and full recovery.” 
His daughter and adviser, Ivanka Trump, tweeted: “The vicious attack of a rabbi in Monsey, NY last night was an act of pure evil. As we pray for the victims, may the candles of Chanukah burn bright through this darkness.” 
The NYPD Counterterrorism Bureau said it was closely monitoring the situation and Jewish organisation the Anti-Defamation League of New York and New Jersey said it was sending someone to the scene. 
About a third of the population of Rockland county is Jewish, including a large enclave of Orthodox Jews who live in secluded communities. 
Jewish communities have been on heightened alert following the 10 December shooting rampage at a northern New Jersey kosher market. Six people died including the two killers, a police officer and three people who had been inside the store. The New Jersey attorney general, Gurbir Grewal, said the attack was driven by hatred of Jews and law enforcement. 
The stabbings in Monsey also come on the heels of apparently antisemitic attacks reported throughout New York during Hanukah. Saturday was the seventh night of Hanukah. Around New York City, police have received eight reports since 13 December of attacks possibly motivated by hatred of Jews. 
Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said: “Israel unequivocally condemns the recent expressions of antisemitism and the vicious attack in the middle of Hanukkah on the rabbi’s house in Monsey, New York. 
“We send our wishes of recovery to the wounded. We will cooperate in every way with the local authorities in order to defeat this phenomenon. We offer our help to each and every state.” 
The attack occurred a month after a man was stabbed while walking to a Monsey synagogue. The man required surgery.

135,terror,Tuesday briefing: Two-thirds of people might catch coronavirus – expert,"Top story: Virus has ‘attack rate’ of up to 80% Hello, Warren Murray here with an open sandwich of news for your morning table. The novel coronavirus epidemic could spread to two-thirds of the world’s population if it cannot be controlled, according to Hong Kong’s leading public health epidemiologist. The number of confirmed cases in the UK has doubled from four to eight – two healthcare workers are among them – as the government announced new powers to detain people suspected of having the virus. Prof Gabriel Leung, the Hong Kong expert, said that if the drastic containment measures adopted by China proved successful, other countries should consider adopting them – but questions remained to be answered. “Have these massive public health interventions, social distancing, and mobility restrictions worked in China?” said Leung, en route to an expert meeting at the WHO in Geneva. “If so, how can we roll them out, or is it not possible?” Most experts thought that each person infected would go on to transmit the virus to around 2.5 other people. That gave a potential “attack rate” of 60 to 80%. “Is 60-80% of the world’s population going to get infected? Maybe not. Maybe this will come in waves. Maybe the virus is going to attenuate its lethality because it certainly doesn’t help it if it kills everybody in its path, because it will get killed as well,” he said. The death toll in China has exceeded 1,000 – more updates at our live blog. * * * 50 terror prisoners face longer jail stay – Emergency legislation will be introduced today to prevent about 50 prisoners convicted of terror offences being automatically freed halfway through their sentences. The move follows the London Bridge knife attacks by Usman Khan in November 2019 and the Streatham stabbings by Sudesh Amman this month. Both men were convicted terrorists released mid-term from prison on licence. Instead of being freed automatically halfway through their sentence, inmates will have to spend at least two-thirds of their term behind bars before being referred to the Parole Board, which will consider their release. Those receiving sentences as offenders of particular concern (SOPCs) will also be affected. * * * All aboard – The PM is expected to give the go-ahead today for the HS2 rail project. Ministers are promising an additional £5bn for buses and cycle routes to head off critics who fear the £100bn high-speed train line will suck cash from other priorities. Johnson’s decision has been keenly anticipated though he appeared to let slip his intentions to a 10-year-old schoolboy who interviewed him last month, telling him: “In a hole the size of HS2, the only thing to do is keep digging.” Labour’s shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: “HS2 has been appallingly mismanaged by the Conservative party, which has failed to deliver a single major infrastructure project on time or within budget. If HS2 is going to get back on track, the project has to be integrated with Crossrail for the North, it needs to be managed as part of an advanced rail network, and it must eventually extend into Scotland so that we remove the need for domestic flights.” * * * University course rankings feared – Academics are sounding the alarm over government plans to label university courses as failing if their graduates earn lower salaries. Senior academics close to Westminster say the Conservatives are pressing on with their manifesto plan to use Ofsted-style rankings in universities. Higher education experts warn that in the arts and humanities starting salaries are typically much lower than in disciplines such as medicine or law; and universities outside London will lose out because of graduates who stay on and work locally rather than going to the capital for a higher salary. Universities fear the government might refuse to provide student loans for “low-quality” courses, threaten universities with removal from the Office for Students’ register if they do not improve, or shut down courses. * * * Maldives bikini arrest – The speaker of the Maldives parliament has apologised to a British tourist after she was bundled off the street by police for wearing a bikini. Police said the woman, who was walking on a main road on the island of Maafushi, was “inappropriately” dressed and allegedly unruly and drunk when she was detained after refusing to comply with requests to cover up. The Maldives once confined tourists to resort islets separate from the local Muslim population but in recent years has allowed foreigners to stay on inhabited islands. The Maldives police service commissioner, Mohamed Hameed, wrote after footage was shared online that the incident “seems to be badly handled … I apologise to the tourist and the public for this”. * * * Bum note – An irreplaceable piano that was treasured by the Canadian virtuoso Angela Hewitt has been broken beyond repair when it was dropped by specialist instrument movers after a recording session in Berlin. Hewitt said her F278 Fazioli – the only one in the world fitted with four pedals, and worth at least £150,000 – was “kaputt … I hope my piano will be happy in piano heaven.”     The classical pianist Angela Hewitt.

136,terror,'I saw them shoot him three times': how Streatham attack unfolded,"Shops and cafes along Streatham High Road were crowded with shoppers and families onthe busy south London thoroughfare when terror struck at around 2pm on Sunday. 
From that moment on, everything happened incredibly quickly. It took the Metropolitan police just one hour and 15 minutes after the first emergency calls to declare it a terror-related incident. By then, two people had been stabbed, with one suffering life-threatening injuries, and one man had been shot dead by armed officers who arrived at the scene. 
Unlike previous attacks on London Bridge and Westminster Bridge, the action did not take place at a London landmark, but a semi-suburban high street. Shocked shoppers were initially unaware they were caught up in a terror incident. 
Unconfirmed reports are of the suspect entering a shop wielding a knife. It is then suggested he came out and stabbed a woman on a bicycle. 
He was then seen being chased by up to three others, dressed in civilian clothes, but now believed to have been undercover officers. Panic set in when gun shots were heard. Witnesses spoke of hearing around three. 
Video footage filmed by onlookers in the immediate aftermath showed a man’s body lying in front of a Boots store. Police carrying machine guns and masked undercover officers were seen approaching the suspect’s body, before rapidly moving away, leading to speculation that the suspect may have been wearing some kind of device, whether real or an imitation. 
Met police later said it was a hoax device. 
One student, who lived in Streatham, was crossing the road when he saw the man being chased. He had “a machete and silver canisters on his chest”, said the 19-year-old, who did not want to be named. Those chasing him were in civilian clothes. 
 
 . 
 
  .
  
 
“The man was then shot. I think I heard three gun shots, but I can’t quite remember,” he said. “After that, I ran into the library to get to safety.” From the library, the student saw ambulances and armed officers swarm on to the street. 
Nardos Mulugeta, 52, a mechanical engineer from Streatham, said he heard gunshots and also saw one victim lying in the street. “I heard a shot, then there was a 20-second gap. Then there were three or four shots together.” 
Mulugeta said he went over to the first victim, a man, on the ground near the White Lion pub where people were already helping him. “Then five minutes later, a woman came over and said she had been stabbed too, in the back. And then people started helping her,” he said. He then saw another man, lying face down, further away. 
Three victims were taken to south London hospitals, the Met later confirmed. One man’s condition is no longer life-threatening after treatment, a Met statement said; one woman with minor injuries has been discharged; and another woman is still being treated for minor injuries that police said were believed to have been caused by glass following the discharge of a police firearm. 
From the shop where he was working with a colleague, Karker Tahir saw the suspect “literally running along the pavement and behind him were two or three police officers, undercover, with a gun”. The officers were shouting “stop”, but “he did not stop”. 
“Then I saw them shoot him three times,” Tahir told Sky News. “He was on the floor.” He looked like he was carrying something, he added. Police then told him and his colleague to leave the shop because it looked like he might have a bomb. He saw the officers checking on the man, then stepping back. “That’s when we ran,” he said. “I am a bit shocked. I have never seen things like that.” 
In the chaos that ensued, passersby attended to the wounded as they waited for ambulances to arrive. David Chawner, an author, spoke on social media of his frustration: “I had to stay with someone who’d just been stabbed in Streatham for 30 minutes before a single ambulance arrived.” 
Chawner told Sky News he had no idea he was in the midst of a terror attack until he saw “the guns”. He said he liaised with paramedics on the phone for half an hour while the man lay “on the street bleeding out”. Police, too, “shared my frustration” especially as they were less than one mile away from two major London hospitals. It was “just an incredibly frantic situation,” he added. 
Luke Black, who was meeting a friend, was just about to have lunch when he saw people running and shouting. “We weren’t sure what was happening and thought it was some kids. It’s only when we got to Boots that we saw a body on the floor and police were ushering people away. We were worried and we heard rumours the man had something strapped to his chest. The police were swift to come in and people were told to leave quickly.” 
“There was lots of tension in the air after the incident and people were scared. I feel sad now. It’s Sunday and a bustling street with families. It’s a shame as there is a nice community here.” 
Local St Leonard’s church rector, Anna Norman-Walker, found her rectory taped off on both sides as police cordoned off the street. Later, she rewrote her Sunday night sermon in light of the day’s events. “Some of us are here tonight quite simply to be together and to say defiantly that this is a community of kindness, tolerance and friendship,” she said. “We are proud not just of our diversity but of the quality of relationships we enjoy with our neighbours that go well beyond that rather loaded word ‘tolerance’.”

137,terror,"‘Systemic Islamophobia’ fuels terror attacks, say Muslim leaders","Muslim leaders from around the world have accused the mainstream media, politicians and academics of contributing to the conditions fuelling terrorist violence against their community such as Friday’s attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand, which claimed 50 lives. More than 350 leading Islamic figures from countries including the UK, US and South Africa have signed a letter to the Guardian, which links the actions of the suspected shooter, the 28-year-old Australian Brenton Tarrant, to an atmosphere of “systemic and institutionalised Islamophobia”. The letter says: “This bigotry has been fuelled by certain callous academics, reckless politicians as well as media outlets who regularly feature those who demonise Islam and Muslims with impunity, disguising their vile mantra behind a veneer of objectivity. “The massacre of Muslims did not just begin with bullets fired from the barrel of Tarrant’s gun. Rather it was decades in the making: inspired by Islamophobic media reports, hundreds and thousands of column inches of hatred printed in the press, many Muslim-hating politicians and unchecked social media bigotry. “Muslims have been constantly cast as suspect communities, foreigners with barbaric views who are a threat to our society. We are now reaping the awful outcome of systemic and institutionalised Islamophobia woven into many sections of our societies.” The letter came as the Conservative peer Sayeeda Warsi called on ministers to heed demands from Muslim leaders for an increase in funding for mosque security after the New Zealand terrorist attack. She said Islamophobia was the party’s “bigotry blind spot”. The former Tory party chair said there was overwhelming evidence to support an increase in funding for mosque protection following the Christchurch attacks. The Muslim Council of Britain has called for increased funding for Muslim places of worship amid a rise in the number of suspected far-right incidents across England, some of which are alleged to have been inspired by the atrocities in New Zealand.   Related: Crisis? What crisis? Senior Tories shrug off Islamophobia warning    Lady Warsi made the comments as a row continued over the Conservatives’ record on tackling Islamophobia. Earlier this month, Warsi repeated calls for an internal inquiry and suggested the most senior figures in the party – including Theresa May – needed to take the problem more seriously. Responding to claims that mosques were inadequately funded, Warsi said: “That’s not an opinion, that’s a fact. There are two different pots of funds: there’s a fund specifically for the protection of synagogues and then a fund of about £2.4m for the protection of all other religious institutions. “The government has to go back and recognise that there is a need right now – and there’s overwhelming evidence that there’s clearly a need – and therefore how quickly is it going to respond to that.” But she added: “I’m really cautious about making comparisons. Each form of hate is unique and specific and has its own challenges. It was quite right for thegovernment to respond when they identified a form of hate with antisemitism and made sure places of worship were protected.” Warsi said a change the government should make – to show it has learned from the attacks in New Zealand – is to adopt a formal definition of Islamophobia. A definition put forward by the all-party parliamentary group on British Muslims had been adopted by the Lib Dems, was being considered by the Labour party and was backed by councils, academics, 850 Muslim organisations and about 70 parliamentarians, she said. “Whether it’s in relation to the protection of mosques, whether it’s in relation to engagement with British Muslim communities, whether it’s in relation to acknowledging the level of hate either within the party or within government policymaking, whether it’s the way we use the language of British Muslim communities, it is our bigotry blind spot. “It comes back down to the fact that we fail to see it and recognise it as a specific form of racism that it is, directed at British Muslim communities, and we therefore fail to make adequate policy and respond.” Harun Khan, the secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, will be writing to May raising the “palpable sense of fear” felt by Muslim communities after the attack in Christchurch, and warning of the risk of copycat attacks in the UK. The government increased security funding for Jewish institutions after the rise in antisemitic attacks, pledging £14m to support the security at about 400 synagogues and 150 Jewish schools, equivalent to more than £25,000 per institution. Khan called on the government to demonstrate equivalent support to Muslim communities. The former integration tsar Dame Louise Casey warned that a New Zealand-style atrocity could occur in the UK. Casey said Britain needed to “wake up” as extremism had not been tackled sufficiently. She also strongly criticised the “appalling behaviour of far too many politicians” and the “mood music” they were creating. The security minister, Ben Wallace, said: “The funding for protective security tacks with the threat. As the threat changes that funding will change with it. “In response to increased threat, we will increase and seek to change the funding around that, and that is why we do have the places of worship scheme. We will absolutely be looking at seeing whether that needs to be increased over the short and longer term.”"
138,terror,Trump puts 'celebrity' terrorism targets ahead of national security – ex-CIA man,"Donald Trump’s approach to counter-terrorism is to go after “celebrity” targets with famous names, regardless of the implications for national security, according to a former CIA officer who served under him. In the wake of the assassination of Qassem Suleimani – and the administration’s contradictory justifications for the strike – Douglas London, a recently retired senior CIA operations officer, has suggested that the decision to kill the Iranian general may have had more to do with the president’s personality than any security considerations. “When it comes to intelligence, like with so much else, Donald Trump likes big names,” London wrote on the legal website, JustSecurity. “It’s this focus on celebrity, headlines, and immediate gratification – versus substance, impact, and consequences – that so often motivates him. “Partly because of this, as a senior CIA counterterrorist manager, my team and I often struggled in persuading the president to recognize the most important threats,” London, who now teaches at Georgetown University’s Center for Security Studies, said. “Now, with the killing of Qassem Suleimani, I worry that while Trump got a big name and lots of headlines, the long-term impact on US strategic interests was not fully considered.”   Related: Suleimani killing the latest in a long, grim line of US assassination efforts    London retired from the CIA at the end of 2018, and his last post was as the chief of counter-terrorism for south and south-west Asia. In his article, London suggested the Suleimani assassination is part of trend. He said Trump was “obsessed” with targeting Osama bin Laden’s son, Hamza, despite being told by his intelligence briefers that he was not likely to succeed Ayman al-Zawahiri, the current al-Qaida leader. Intelligence assessments said that Zawahiri and his senior lieutenants posed a greater danger, but “the president thought differently”. “Trump’s obsession in focusing resources against Osama bin Laden’s son Hamza is one example of the president’s preference for a ‘celebrity’-targeted killing versus prioritizing options that could prove better for US security,” London said. In July, it was reported that Hamza bin Laden had been killed. London did not quite confirm that his former agency was behind the death, but noted a news account quoting US officials as saying the US “played a role in the operation that killed him”. Trump showed the same obsession with notoriety after the strike killing Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, London wrote, saying that the president lost interest in pursuing lower-level operational Isis leaders. “Although US efforts to target key Isis leaders and operatives had preempted what might have been any number of devastating terrorist attacks, the president’s lack of familiarity with their names made such efforts, and their accomplishments, less consequential to him,” he said. London added that the killing of Suleimani, the head of the elite Quds Force of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, “appears to have been more about Trump, and the potential for headlines, rather than the intelligence”. The decision showed “resistance to intelligence community input”, London argued, and expressed doubt over reports that the CIA director, Gina Haspel, supported it. Trump has claimed that Suleimani was about to mount attacks on four US embassies, but his defence secretary, Mark Esper, has said he was unaware of such a threat, and the embassies do not appear to have been put on alert.   Related: Reprisals against US to come at time and place of Iran's choosing    “I do not debate we had intelligence regarding any number of prospective attacks Iran was facilitating through proxies in Iraq, and elsewhere. But don’t we always?” London asked. “It’s what they do.” He predicted that, after the initial waves of Iranian retaliatory missile attacks aimed US troops embedded in Iraqi bases, Iran would strike again, in covert ways. “I expect that the Intelligence Community has told the president as much, or would have, if he bothered to solicit and value its input,” London said. “Instead, the president’s decision to kill Suleimani reflects his propensity to play a good hand badly and respond from ego rather than pragmatism and the country’s best interests.”"
139,terror,Spanish police arrest Catalan separatists on suspicion of terrorism,"Nine Catalan independence activists have been arrested in Barcelona and face charges of “rebellion, terrorism and possession of explosives”, authorities have said. Police said they confiscated material they alleged could be used in bomb making during raids early on Monday morning. The raids were aimed at aborting actions that “could have caused irreparable damages”, prosecutors said. According to the police, those detained are associated with the Committees for the Defence of the Republic (CDR), a network of radical groups that advocates direct action to secure Catalan independence from Spain. The arrests, made in a variety of locations in the Barcelona area, were carried out by the civil guard under instruction from an audiencia nacional (national court) judge, who deals with serious offences such as terrorism, drug smuggling and organised crime. The nine arrested people are said to be members of the CDR’s so-called tactical response team. The team has previously blocked major roads and railway lines but its principal tactic to date has been passive resistance rather than outright confrontation. Police said they believed the activists were planning to carry out sabotage and violent attacks on 1 October, the second anniversary of the illegal referendum on independence, to coincide with the sentencing of Catalan politicians for their role in the poll and the subsequent unilateral declaration of independence. The politicians are expected to be sentenced on or around 10 October. The arrests were the result of an anti-terrorist investigation that was launched more than a year ago. Catalan separatists are increasingly divided on how to maintain the impetus of a movement that is gradually losing momentum, with one section calling for dialogue while the other, led by the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont and his successor, Quim Torra, calling for “confrontation” with Madrid. The two main grassroots independence organisations, the Catalan National Assembly and Òmnium Cultural, believe direct action would damage the movement’s image, while the CDR has called for active civil disobedience, claiming “liberation doesn’t exist without tension”. Last year, on the first anniversary of the referendum, Torra was widely criticised for inciting the CDR to cause maximum disruption. The radicals have since turned on the president, claiming he is a traitor to the cause. In a tweet, the CDR responded to the arrests with a call for a “united front” against the “kingdom of Spain’s machinery and repressive forces”, adding: “Nothing can stop a committed and combative people.” Torra said Spain was trying to construct a violent narrative ahead of the sentencing date for the Catalan politicians, several of whom are accused of rebellion, a charge that will only stick if it can be proved that they used violence. The independence movement “is and always will be peaceful”, he said. Puigdemont accused Spain of “fabricating a terrorism case”, adding: “Freedom is the way to respond to repression.” "
140,terror,"The Guardian view on Tiananmen, 30 years on: hope and terror","It’s inevitable that we view the past through the lens of the present. It’s odder that we tend to regard our current picture as the only possible one, and to believe that we can see the future with equal certainty. Revulsion at the bloody crackdown on pro-reform demonstrations in Beijing, on the night of 3-4 June 1989, has obscured memories of the protests themselves. But in China, some still grieve for lost hopes as well as lost friends and children. The weeks of demonstrations in Beijing and other cities proved the people’s desire for change. Millions – including police, judges and naval officers – were drawn in, prompted by anger at corruption and inflation, but also the hunger for reform and greater liberty. China was negotiating a period of social, political and artistic ferment, deeply questioning itself as it recovered from the traumas of Maoism and reopened to the world. The protests crystallised the possibility of China taking another path after 40 years of tight control by the Communist party. Instead, the killing of hundreds of students, workers and other residents confirmed its course. Many of the students simply could not believe their leaders would turn guns upon them. Even when the shooting started, they assumed the bullets were rubber. But China had a choice, and the authorities picked terror. Even then, many observers assumed a reckoning was only a matter of time – their confidence bolstered by the revolutions in eastern Europe that same year. Others believed the country’s embrace of capitalism would inexorably lead to greater political freedom, even if it came slowly. But in the years that followed, the leadership would substitute economic wellbeing and nationalism for their original mission. The prosperity enjoyed by so many in China, increased personal freedoms in many regards, and years of censorship and propaganda, mean that the Communist party enjoys a degree of support that many elected governments would envy. Some of those who marched in 1989 now insist that the leaders’ actions were necessary. A younger generation are largely unaware that these events ever took place. This willed amnesia has added to the pain of those most deeply affected. The international backlash in 1989 was stark – both the US and EU imposed arms embargoes, which endure – but for the most part relatively short-lived. China then was economically puny. As it prospered, business people overseas quickly seized the opportunity it offered. Now many countries have concluded that China will not change and that there is no point risking their own economic interests by badgering it. Not just big corporations but academic presses have begun to censor themselves. The silence which began at home is spreading, as shown by the muted reaction to another crime against human rights unfolding in China today. An estimated 1 million Uighurs and other Muslims are incarcerated in detention camps in Xinjiang and forced to undergo political indoctrination, perhaps because they have relatives abroad or have engaged in normal religious practices. Meanwhile, the rise of authoritarian governments around the world has made China appear less an outlier than a norm-setter. It is hard for those who care about human rights to find hope in the international realm, and still harder to discern it in China’s domestic trajectory. If anyone in the leadership secretly sympathises with demands for political liberalisation, they cannot let anyone know. The buildup of the mammoth domestic security apparatus makes a mass movement in the manner of 1989 impossible. In recent years, as political repression has grown, even a private commemoration of the massacre has led to charges. The faltering of the party’s economic legitimacy could well mean more aggressive nationalism abroad rather than more liberty at home. What we cannot know is how forces will play out in the longer term. As the Tiananmen Square protests showed, the unexpected and implausible does happen. We will not see a repeat of those events; but nor should we fool ourselves we’ve seen the future. It is not preordained."
141,terror,The day Kieran Trippier met the fitness coach who strikes terror into players,"Oscar Ortega has a reputation for being a bit of a sadist. Nicknamed El Profe, the teacher, he is part man, part myth, mixing fear, fascination and fondness too, his very name striking terror into footballers’ hearts. Atlético Madrid’s fitness coach, a 61-year-old Uruguayan drill sergeant who spent the morning of the 2016 Champions League final doing laps of San Siro, Ortega likes nothing more than running them until they drop, vomit and pass out – while shouting at them. Or better still, laughing. So, ask Kieran Trippier’s new teammates what awaits him in Spain, and many would smile knowingly and reply, tongue in cheek: El Profe does. 
Which might be just what he needs; it’s certainly a little different.

Atlético announced Trippier’s £20m signing at 6pm on Wednesday evening; by 6.10pm he was heading out of the team’s hotel in Los Angeles de San Rafael and off to the training pitch up in the mountains towards Segovia, where the club spend their pre-season boot camps. For the first time in 40 years, they weren’t there last summer, but now they’re back and it’s bigger, and harder, than ever before. Two gyms have been set up in marquees and alongside the pitch where Trippier is taking his first steps as an Atlético player is the Profe Slope, a 50 metre, 30% climb Ortega had built and up which he sends his players. July’s blisters are May’s strength, they like to say. 
Trippier’s timing was good: that morning, the last session before he arrived, Diego Costa had to drop out after one sprint up the Profe Slope left him dizzy and disoriented, and he has not had to follow yet. But, beware, it’s there, it will be used and they were quickly on to him. Thursday morning was tough, still felt on Thursday evening: the grin, and the sweat, spoke of the work. There will be no escape, and if Trippier is to improve anywhere, if there is a place that can make him a better defender, it is here. It is what they do.

He knows that. This looks like a different Atlético, undergoing a shift in identity, those old certainties gone with the departing footballers who represented them but some things never change, some qualities are non-negotiable. Take João Felix: presented as “pure art”, then turned into a project to toughen up. And at his presentation at the Metropolitano, squeezed in between Thursday’s double session, Trippier spoke about the importance of Diego Simeone in his decision to join Atlético; he talked of the “ethic, the effort”. 
He spoke too about the “family”. And, when it comes to the coaching staff that means a 13-man team led by El Profe and the former goalkeeper, rock singer and assistant coach Germán Burgos. Often seen as old school, this is a hands-on coaching team. Foot in, too. Simeone literally runs through every drill with them. It is a team that has not always had great luck with strikers but repeatedly developed the best defenders. 
Nicknamed Mono – the monkey – Burgos is the man who once told José Mourinho he would tear his head off and the man who looked as if he probably could too. Yet he is also a man everyone loves, of warmth, an immense heart. He was talking Trippier through the movements as he was thrown straight into a starting XI of sorts, playing in a 4-4-2 alongside Savic, Felipe and Lodi in the first evening and a 4-3-1-2 with newly signed Mario Hermoso in for Felipe in the second. Three in the back four are new following the departures of Juanfran, Diego Godín and Filipe Luís, with José Giménez likely to play when he returns. The ideals persist, though, as do the traditions: the new man arrived and ran the gauntlet, teammates kicking and slapping him. 
On Thursday evening, it was as if Burgos was man-marking Trippier, tracking his every step, talking through the positional exercises and taking up a position on his touchline in the game. Close and within earshot: “Go, go, go; calm, calm, beri gud.” At every turn and with every query Burgos was there. He was grateful for it. Trippier had spoken repeatedly during his presentation of his desire to learn Spanish – “my priority” he called it, something he always wanted to do and now has the excuse for – but it will take time. On occasions, Álvaro Morata approached to explain further. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
Trippier has taken the place of Juanfran, departing after eight years. He will compete with Santiago Arias for the right-back slot, but will anticipate being a starter. His inclusion in two consecutive starting XIs underlines that, and the work to integrate him. 
A former winger converted to full-back, Juanfran’s profile – and indeed that of Arias and of Nelson Semedo, who they chased – helps challenge the myth that the role Trippier steps into is a purely defensive one. Both Juanfran on the right and Filipe Luís on the left contributed enormously in attack: width came more from them than the midfielders, who tended to be squeezed inside. That will be eventuated if Simeone sticks to the diamond midfield he is preparing here. It is one of the reasons why they have focused on the Englishman – their first since a striker called Drinkwater 90 years ago and only their second ever.

Atletico’s president, Enrique Cerezo, talked about the importance of Trippier’s quality, his ability to deliver telling passes, crosses and dead balls and, while he was reading from a prepared sheet, this is a key element. Trippier will not be expected to defend only, but to play. That was clear in the session: defensively, his position will probably be deeper, with less space behind him, but with the ball they sought him early and high, out on the touchline, the man to provide the final cross. 
That’s the part they bought and will work on, providing the structure and position from which he can provide the passes. But it is not the only thing, not their badge of identity during the Simeone years. The effort, the physique, the defending is something they can build, as they have done so many times before. And it all begins with a run up a man-made hill, built to make them sweat. "
142,terror,‘Our rage and terror give us power’: what drives young activists?,"Noga Levy-Rapoport, 17, led the London climate strike march on 15 February and has since become a core organiser at UK Student Climate Network I first got involved in the February school strike in London. I saw something about it online and I wanted an opportunity to say that I, as a young person, am angry about what is going on. I’m afraid, and I feel that there is great injustice. I felt like for the first time in a long time, we had actually taken a stand. After that I contacted Youth Strike 4 Climate and said I wanted to be involved, full-time. We are told that we’re jumping on this bandwagon of adolescent insolence, but that is just not true. We’re marching on the streets because we are furious – we are full of rage and terror – and those together have taught me that young people have the real power in our society. Our empowerment as individuals is key to change, and it has been the way that protests have brought change about over centuries. We need a fundamental change to our system – we need to fulfil the principles of the Green New Deal, and we need to listen to everyone. Activism for me is a part of my life and will remain that way, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to go on and become an MP. I want to be an opera singer. Activism shouldn’t change who you are, it should come from who you are, and your beliefs, and how you want the world to see other people.     ‘We got quite a bit of criticism – lots of people saying we were going to hell ’ … Mugdha Mokashi. Photograph: PR    Mugdha Mokashi, 22, is president elect of Medical Students for Choice and grew up in Alabama I’m in my first year at Harvard Medical School. I was born in India but I consider Alabama my home, and I intend to return to provide abortion services when my studies are finished. I became interested in reproductive justice when I was 19. I started volunteering at a rape crisis centre. From there I started working in an organisation called URGE (Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity). They primarily work in states where the government and legislation is typically conservative or Republican. I brought a chapter to my campus. We held something called the Abortion Positive Tour in 2017, spending a week on campus, talking and distributing information about abortion, then we would hold a rally at the end. We got quite a bit of feedback and criticism – lots of yelling, lots of people saying we were going to hell – but it wasn’t as dramatic as it could have been. There was no threat of physical violence. When Donald Trump was elected we felt a sense of urgency and we marched. I’ve learned that activism is most effective when the voices of the people who are being oppressed or targeted are elevated and centred. Nothing really does that better than protest. It’s a very accessible form of engagement you really can’t beat how persuasive visceral emotion and passion are. An important tenet of activism is doing work both “inside” and “outside the building”. Outside are the traditional forms of protest, rallying and grassroots action, but you have to establish change inside, too. My interest is in reforming the medical institution and the policy-making sphere to match what people are marching about. The power of being disruptive and visible is a salient part of protest that I have been using in my day‑to-day work – the idea that to bring about change, people need to feel uncomfortable, and that to shift the window of discourse, you need something really powerful.      ‘I was born into activism’ … Dallas Goldtooth. Photograph: Bryan Tarnowski/The Guardian    Dallas Goldtooth, 35, is based in Chicago. He is the Keep It in the Ground campaigner for the Indigenous Environmental Network As cliched as it sounds, I was born into activism. My dad has been an organiser since as far back as I can remember. My own experience of organising started about six years ago in the fight against the Keystone XL pipeline, a tar sands pipeline that was supposed to cross the traditional territories of my people – the Great Sioux Nation. We brought to the doors of the White House a march of 10,000 people, led by Native American and non-Native farmers and ranchers, and we set up a tipi camp on the National Mall for six days. I’m pretty proud to say we won that campaign. We were able to convince the Obama administration not to approve that pipeline. That’s the goal of any good organiser – to work themselves out of a job. There are many different forms of protest, but they should all be tactics for a greater strategy. There is a lot of political turmoil right now and people are justifiably angry about the attacks on their self-determination, their land, their bodies. We want to march, and that’s powerful because we’re acting on the moment, and people have a right to express their anger and frustrations. But we have to challenge ourselves to look at the bigger picture of what we’re building towards. The change that we wish to see, that we’re trying to create in this world, has to be about addressing and challenging power. If our conversations, if our work, if our lives don’t challenge the systems of power, then we’re not really working towards the just society that we want. We have to reimagine our relationships to the greater world, to the land and to the ecosystem in which we live. That’s a very strong indigenous framework: if you innately believe that the Earth is your mother and the animals and plants around you are brothers and sisters, then you have a responsibility to care for them in a different manner than if you just see them as natural resources to be managed. Yang Porter, 24, is a campaigner for women’s rights in Saudi Arabia It was against the law for women to drive in Saudi Arabia, but in the early 2010s there was a Facebook campaign calling on Saudi women to go out and drive at a certain time, and a few women responded and went out and drove cars together. Many of them were put in jail and made to sign documents saying they would not drive again. When the new crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, came to power, he decided it was time to give women the right to drive [in May 2018], but the authorities cracked down on the women who had protested before and jailed them again.    People now are willing to give up their lives for a prosperous future for the collective: you have to make sacrifices  Yang Porter     I’m speaking on behalf of these women. I haven’t suffered the consequences personally but I’ve seen them suffer the consequences, and that’s really what’s moving me now to make these efforts to expose what’s happening. Women’s freedom has a long way to go in Saudi Arabia; women can now drive, but still need permission from their male guardians to travel and to marry. I want to make people aware that there is still a human rights crisis going on there. What protest is happening now in Saudi Arabia is down to the scattered efforts of individuals. People are too afraid to act collectively. I can’t really think of a Saudi collective group that has achieved anything in the last 100 years. We’re not really familiar with collective effort, but it’s possible, if this situation gets worse, that it might happen. I really hope it does. Demanding rights comes at a price. Everyone who has spoken out has suffered consequences. People reap the benefits from the accumulated efforts of others. That’s how the history machine works, with individual sacrifice as its engine. Ancient civilisations used to believe that human sacrifices were necessary for their society to survive and prosper; this principle still applies. The only thing that has changed is that people now are willing to pay the price – to give up themselves, their lives and their time for a prosperous future for the collective. It’s how you make the world a better place: sacrifice.     ‘It is very important not to give up’ ... Agnes Chow. Photograph: Benjamin Haas/The Guardian    Agnes Chow, 22, is a Hong Kong pro‑democracy campaigner for Demosistō I started getting involved in social movements in Hong Kong in 2012, when I was 15. I was just an ordinary schoolgirl focusing on my studies and working hard to enter university, but one day I discovered the Facebook page of Scholarism [Hong Kong’s student pro-democracy movement] and saw a picture of a group of students, including Joshua Wong, out on the streets voicing their opposition to the “patriotic” national education curriculum at that time. So I did some research and decided to join them. My current organisation, Demosistō, which grew out of Scholarism, is no longer a political party as we were disqualified from the elections, but I would say there is a big difference between fighting for change through elections and through social movements. Social movements, including protest, are a direct way to get involved and to change people’s minds. People might have thought the “umbrella movement” in 2014 was a violent way to show your anger to the government but it turned out to be very peaceful, even though we occupied many of the main roads in Hong Kong. So it is not only a way for people to voice their opinions, it’s also a channel for changing people’s minds. Many thought that Hong Kong people were just concerned with how to earn more money and live in bigger apartments, but people are also very concerned about our human rights, our freedom, our political system. And some of them, like Joshua, have even sacrificed their personal freedom. They want to use their sacrifice to fight for something better for the city. It is very important not to give up. After the umbrella movement, a lot of people have maybe given up their dream that Hong Kong should have a democratic political system, because nothing changed. But when we look at the history of social change in other areas – such as gender or race equality – we see how people have needed to fight for 20 or 30 or even 100 years. I’m 22 years old; perhaps I’ll have to fight for Hong Kong’s democracy until I’m 70. Many people in other countries have sacrificed much more than us: their lives, years of personal freedom, so I don’t think I have done a lot for Hong Kong, yet. Dan Wilson Craw, 35, lives in Newcastle. He is a housing activist and director of Generation Rent I worked in London during my 20s and I found that housing seemed to be a completely insurmountable problem for members of my generation, who were sold this idea that if you work hard, you shouldn’t need to worry about your housing. That was not happening, and I realised we could be doing something about this.     ‘I know just how much of a difference having a stable home makes to people’s quality of life’ ... Dan Wilson Craw. Photograph: PR    Over the past five years we’ve been a national body getting private renters heard in the policy-making process and urging for reform of the housing system. We have recently been part of campaigns to scrap Section 21 and end unfair evictions, and to get letting fees banned. We’ve picketed branches of NatWest bank, which was revealed to be effectively preventing landlords from letting to tenants on low incomes. We’ve also been involved in wider protests of the housing movement, such as the 2015 March for Homes, and marches and demonstrations since the Grenfell Tower fire tragedy. There were a lot of vested interests in the property industry trying to resist all this, but there was a lot of anger out there from renters. Equally important was the fact that we had credible alternatives we could point to: places such as Germany and Scotland that had already been implementing these reforms, and being able to demonstrate there is no reason why we should have such an unfair system. It was about having those convictions and making sure we stuck by them. The reason I’m a housing activist is because I know just how much of a difference having a stable home makes to people’s quality of life. One of the words that keeps coming up when I talk to others in the movement is “autonomy” – just having that ability to be in control of your life. Private renting doesn’t offer that at the moment. That has a knock-on effect on your health because if your landlord can bully you into not complaining about things, you end up with an unsafe home. The threat of eviction hanging over you affects your mental health as well. So fixing the housing system can help all of those things.     ‘There are still so many things that need to be fixed around gun control’ … Saida Dahir.  Photograph: PR    Saida Dahir, 18, went to the US as a refugee from Somalia, aged three. She gave a spoken word performance at a March for Our Lives protest in Salt Lake City, Utah The day of the shooting in Parkland, Florida, I was very distraught. I’ve written poetry since I was about seven years old, about things that I want to see change in the world, things happening around me, in my family, on the news or in my community. So I wrote a poem that day, and then 15 months later [in March 2018] I helped organise the March for Our Lives in my town, Salt Lake City, and I read that poem in front of the crowd as a tribute. I started doing activism when I was around 12 years old. The first protest I ever went to was a Free Palestine protest in downtown Salt Lake City. It was very liberating to see so many people moving towards something they wanted to achieve as a collective. From there I got really involved with Black Lives Matter. I was a representative for my chapter and I held a bunch of different protests for prominent black men shot and killed by the police. I’ve always been ready to speak up about things that I think need changing, things I think are crucial to our society and are not progressing us in the direction of unity. In the beginning it was very scary being a part of the March for Our Lives organisation. There was a lot of hostility and lack of understanding between the two sides. Before we held our 2018 march, there was a “March Before Our Lives” that was all about pro-gun people. The Utah Gun Exchange had flyers and posters, and they were very aggressive towards us kids who were just speaking up for ourselves. But when we started doing things like town hall meetings and community dialogues, that really opened up the conversation. People saw that the stereotypes of activists all over the news and social media were not true, and they were willing to have a conversation about things that needed to change. There are still so many things that need to be fixed around gun control, but we can make the world a better place by educating ourselves. And teaching our children. Our generation has moved and pushed so much that the next generation’s going to do tenfold what we are doing. Neha Shah, 21, is the former chair of Oxford Student Union’s Campaign for Racial Awareness and Equality I come from a politically engaged family and I’ve been quite heavily involved in refugee solidarity work, anti-deportations activism, Palestine solidarity and anti-fascist activism. When I first came to Oxford University I got involved in the Rhodes Must Fall protest movement. While the campaign was portrayed in the media as being about individual racist colonialists, it was really about something much bigger: effecting structural change. It exposed how the active legacies of British colonialism form an integral part of both British national and university policies, and render so many members of black and migrant communities invisible.     ‘It’s about doing what’s right and doing our bit to try and stop the rise of the far right’ … Neha Shah. Photograph: Neha Shah    I’m currently involved in a coalition of student and city groups seeking to boycott the Oxford Union, which hosts openly fascist and racist speakers in order to essentially amuse their elite membership. This has become remarkably worse recently, as the global far right has been rising. The founder of the English Defence League, Tommy Robinson, spoke there in 2014; Alice Weidel, leader of the German AfD party, was invited but pulled out after massive opposition from students and residents. In November 2018 the former Trump adviser and co-founder of Breitbart Steve Bannon spoke, and during the 1,000-strong protest against this, neo-Nazis were filmed performing Hitler salutes outside the Oxford Union, emboldened by Bannon’s words. The same people physically attacked me and another student protester – I was not badly hurt. The dominant narrative in the media is about “no platforming” but it’s not that at all; it’s about doing our bit to try and stop the rise of the far right. We have to open the road behind us. That involves learning from the history of those who have struggled for freedom in the past. If you look at these movements in a narrow and defeatist way, you might come to the conclusion that they failed, because the basic power relations that they sought to change – be they colonialism, imperialism, patriarchy, capitalism – remain in place. But in these different visions of freedom, every new generation and every new activist can find the lessons and the inspiration to keep struggling • Interviews by Steve Rose."
143,terror,Labor pushes for greater response to extreme rightwing terrorism threat,"Labor MPs have welcomed spy agency Asio’s recognition that the threat from extreme rightwing terrorism in Australia is on the rise but will now push the government to do more to counter the threat. On Thursday, Labor MP Anne Aly – a former academic specialising in countering violent extremism – said the recognition of the threat was “a long time coming” and suggested Australia had been slow to recognise the alleged Christchurch massacre shooter was “one of us”. Ed Husic questioned why Asio had not noted the links between rightwing extremists in the United States and Australia, and suggested the federal government spends “more money on government advertising than on countering violent extremism”.   Related: Threat from extreme rightwing terrorism in Australia has increased, Asio says    In August, Husic wrote to the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, warning that the series of “horrific mass shootings in the United States” citing the Christchurch massacre as inspiration indicated that extremist violence was crossing borders and inspiring copycat attacks. “On Australian soil we have seen reports of escalating and brazen extremist white supremacist activity or public demonstrations of support for these extremist views, notably the far-right rally held in St Kilda earlier this year,” Husic said. Aly has shared her expertise already with the New Zealand royal commission examining the Christchurch mosques attack and will meet the inquiry team again in November when they visit Australia ahead of delivering a report in December. Aly told Guardian Australia she had shared Asio’s assessment of an increased risk in rightwing extremist violence for five years and welcomed “the recognition of white supremacist/alt-right ideologies that fuel violent extremism”. Aly noted that Asio had said a future extreme rightwing-inspired attack would most likely be committed by a lone actor or small group, adding that lone actors are “mobilised through some kind of social network, usually through the internet” such as chat spaces and gaming rooms. Aly said counter-terror agencies should be monitoring and evaluating people’s public online behaviour for “tell-tale signs”, as many perpetrators of violence announce intentions ahead of acting. Australia needs to tackle rhetoric used to “justify and embolden” rightwing extremism and to go through a process of introspection to identify “the kinds of attitudes that can normalise violence”, she said. “It’s really hard to turn the mirror on yourself – it’s much easier when terrorism is committed by others, but when terrorism is committed by ‘us’, that’s a much harder thing to accept.” She said the response that the alleged Christchurch shooter is “not one of us” is wrong. “No, actually, he is [one of us],” she said. The massacre of 49 people at two mosques in Christchurch in March, for which 28-year-old Australian Brenton Tarrant has been charged, prompted renewed scrutiny of the far right including by Australia’s home affairs department. After the attacks, Scott Morrison called for less “mindless tribalism” in politics and for Australians to “disagree better” but there has been little sense of collective responsibility in Australia despite the increased mobilisation of the far right. Husic said that Australia needed to take rightwing extremism more seriously, citing a trial in Victoria of a man charged with preparing a terrorist act against left wing and Muslim groups and an incident involving a man with a machete approaching a mosque at Holland Park in Brisbane. “Last year alone we saw 50 terror-related deaths in the US overwhelmingly as the result of far right extremism,” he told Sky News. Husic noted the Asio report had discussed international threats of terrorism from Europe, Asia and the Middle East but made “no reference” to the US which suggested there was “very little evidence” it was watching events there which “might have an impact on us, because [the threat is] crossing borders”. In the same annual report that it acknowledged the growing rightwing terror threat, Asio warned that its increasing workload from “unprecedented” levels of foreign interference and espionage is stretching its current resources. But on Thursday, Dutton played down the concern, telling reporters in Canberra that Asio’s funding “goes up every year”. “We will put more money in each year and, as I say, the staffing numbers grow each year,” he said. “Look, every agency head across the commonwealth wants more money into their agency, and every minister wants more money into their departments and their agencies.” Husic said he would be “very concerned” if agency requests for more resources to combat violent extremism were ignored. “I urge the Coalition government to take this threat more seriously … If we can move quickly on farm protests we can also move on this.”"
144,terror,Christchurch: how quiet city became target for terror,"Twenty-four hours after a gunman rampaged through two mosques in the South Island city of Christchurch, attention was turning to why this quiet, provincial enclave became the target for New Zealand’s deadliest extremist attack – and what lured the suspect to drive more than 350km north from his home in Dunedin to carry out the attack. There is dissonance too in the benign atmosphere of Christchurch, “the garden city”, and the grotesque horror that unfolded on Friday afternoon. It was for a long time described as “the most English city outside of England”, with its quaint gardens and picturesque gothic revival architecture. Named after Christ Church, Oxford, the city is bisected by the river Avon and in its centre stood, until the devastating 2011 earthquake, the commanding Christchurch Cathedral. The pace of life is slow, the people modest. Paul Buchanan, a security analyst at the 36th Parallel consultancy, said between 1% and 2% of Christchurch’s 340,000 inhabitants were Muslim. He said the close proximity of the two mosques (just 5.5km apart), their large size and lack of security made them a “soft target”.   Related: What we know so far about the New Zealand shooting    “The election of Donald Trump has emboldened the alt-right around the world, and New Zealand is no exception to that. “The alt-right in this country has been invigorated over the last few years and part of that has to do with the fact they weren’t under the scrutiny of the security services that the Muslim community was.” In the years since the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, which left 185 people dead and the quaint cathedral city in ruins, the authorities paused the region’s refugee resettlement programme while they attempted to rebuild the city centre. During the same years, Christchurch lost 20,000 people from its population – residents who no longer saw a future for themselves in the city. Mental health issues, domestic violence and substance abuse rates have soared. Last year, with large parts of the city functioning again, Christchurch once again began operating as a refugee resettlement centre, welcoming people from Syria in large numbers, some of whom were believed to be among the dead in Friday’s attack. The Jacinda Ardern government has doubled the country’s annual quota of refugees from 750 a year to 1,500, with those from Syria making up the bulk of arrivals. The refugees were actively courted by provincial cities in the South Island with low, ageing populations, including Dunedin, where the suspect in the attacks lived, and Christchurch, where the massacres unfolded.     People leave messages and flowers outside Christchurch’s Botanic Gardens in tribute to the victims of the mosque mass shootings. Photograph: Fiona Goodall/Getty Images    Suddenly hijabs and prayer caps appeared in greater numbers in cities with overwhelmingly homogenous ethnically European populations.  Prof Robert Patman, an expert in foreign affairs at Otago University, said that while many questions remained, the size of Christchurch’s Muslim population, which is larger than Dunedin’s, could have made it a target. He said New Zealand’s reputation as a peace-loving nation could also have been a factor in the planning.   Related: 'We love you': mosques around world showered with flowers after Christchurch massacre    “New Zealand stands for everything these people hate. It is a beautiful country, it puts a big emphasis on inclusion. It’s not perfect but it’s working hard to improve its race relations. And there’s a lot of tolerance here, it’s diverse and friendly. “And from their point of view if they can pull off a big event in a country that has been relatively untouched by terrorism – that would be regarded as a notch in their belt.” Patman said the suspect might have wanted to divide Christchurch and the country. But as Cantabrians – as locals of the Canterbury region are referred to – keep repeating to each other and their Muslim friends, ultimately the plan failed, because “they are us and we are them”. “Their [the alt-right’s] narrative is the western world and the Muslim world can’t coexist. Christchurch is showing them that is utterly wrong,” Patman said. Instead of a city that is easy to divide, Christchurch has proved calm and united in the immediate wake of the attack. At Christchurch hospital, where many members of the Muslim community spent Saturday waiting for news of loved ones, members of the public turned up offering car lifts around town, food parcels and hot drinks, or just a friendly face to talk too. “New Zealanders love us,” said one man at the hospital, an Afghan refugee and survivor of the attack. “And we love them.” On the streets Kiwis use subtle shorthand to check on each other’s welfare – a brief head nod, a quick meeting of the eyes and a small smile. “All good?” they say. At the memorial that has sprung up on Deans Avenue, the location of the first mosque shooting, displays of emotion are more overt. Locals have formed circles, linking their arms around each others shoulders and singing waiata (Māori songs), laying bouquets of flowers handpicked from Christchurch gardens – hydrangeas, roses and lilies – and crying openly in public – a rarity in this country. “Kia kaha,” people say to each other, which in Māori means “stay strong”. • Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day.

145,terror,Pakistan PM to accuse Modi of complicity in Kashmir 'terrorism',"Pakistan’s prime minister, Imran Khan, is to follow a speech by his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, at the United Nations general assembly by accusing him of being complicit in the torture and mass detention of protesters in India-administered Kashmir. 
Khan will use his address in New York next week to highlight alleged atrocities being carried out by the Indian army in the Jammu and Kashmir state since Modi’s government revoked the region’s autonomy by abrogating article 370 of the constitution. 
Sardar Masood Khan, Pakistan’s former permanent representative to the United Nations who now acts as president of the Pakistani-administered Azad Kashmir state, said his government believed as many as 10,000 people had been detained by Indian security forces. Those numbers have been rejected by the Indian government.

    With the end of British colonial rule, the Indian subcontinent is partitioned into predominantly Hindu India and mainly Muslim Pakistan. Mass migrations follow, with Hindus and Muslims moving to their country of choice. More than a million people are killed in the communal violence that ensues.

    India and Pakistan fight their first war over control of Muslim-majority Kashmir, a kingdom ruled by Hindu Maharaja Hari Singh. The war ends in 1948 with a UN brokered ceasefire, leaving Kashmir divided between the nations, with the promise of a referendum to chose which nation its people wish to join.

Khan said: “These detainees include children, young men, and people of all ages, and people from all walks of life. They have been tortured. There is a BBC documentary with evidence: people have been beaten up in detention, beaten up with sticks and cables and excessive force has been used against them. And some of the witnesses have said in testimony to the BBC and other news outlets, that they would lose their consciousness and police officers would then use electric shocks to revive them. 
“It is not hearsay, it is not rumour. Despite all the restrictions, the [internet] blackout, the international media has managed to establish a pattern of gross and consistent violation of human rights and systematic torture.” 
Indian government sources said that decisions on detentions were being made at a local level to maintain law and order. 
The detentions were preventive in nature and were being continuously reviewed and appropriate decisions will be made based on law and order assessments, a spokesperson said. The Indian army responded to the allegations of torture of villagers in Jammu Kashmir aired by the BBC, by describing them as “baseless and unsubstantiated”. 
India’s supreme court ordered the country’s government on Monday to restore normal life in Kashmir as soon as possible but added that the government should bear in mind the national interest. 
 
  
  
   
    Who controls Kashmir?
    
    The region in the foothills of the Himalayas has been under dispute since&nbsp;India&nbsp;and Pakistan came into being in 1947.
    Both claim it in full, but each controls a section of the territory, separated by one of the world's most heavily militarised borders: the ‘line of control’ based on a ceasefire border established after a 1947-48 war. China controls another part in the east.
    India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.
    
    How did the dispute start?
    
    After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous ‘princely states’ across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.
    Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.
    In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.
    In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.
    
    What was Kashmir’s special status?
    
    Kashmir’s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;
    An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.
    The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.
    On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir’s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan – which quickly called India’s actions illegal – and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.
    
    What do the militants want?
    
    There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.
    Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;extreme force&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.
    For Indians, control of Kashmir – part of the country’s only Muslim-majority state – has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe
    
   
  
  
 
India stripped its only Muslim-majority state of autonomy on 5 August, shutting off phone networks and imposing a curfew in moves that were said to be necessary to remove the threat of terrorism and to keep law and order. 
India’s attorney general, KK Venugopal, told the court that not a single bullet had been fired and that communications restrictions were being lifted. 
Speaking to the Guardian during a visit to Brussels, Khan, the 27th president of neighbouring Azad Kashmir, said the Indian government were “congenital liars” and suggested that there was a danger of India arranging a “false flag” terror attack in Kashmir to justify its actions. 
He said: “The situation is as bad as it was, it is in fact deteriorating. The Indians are trying to put a spin on what is happening there and mislead the world that everything is normal and I can tell you that everything is not normal. People have been protesting and they have been hiding these protests.” 
Khan said Pakistan’s prime minister would use the stage at the UN general assembly in New York to expose the situation in Indian-administered Kashmir a “direct and forthright” manner. 
By coincidence, the leaders of India and Pakistan are both scheduled to address the UN next Friday afternoon. 
“We would of course highlight the ongoing atrocities in Kashmir and the responsibility of the international community to avoid a genocide there,” he said. “To be very candid: there is terrorism but this is from the Indian side. Nine hundred thousand troops brutalised the people of Jammu Kashmir. I call it terrorism and it is being practised by the indian state apparatus.” 
The Azad Kashmir president defended the recent arrests of 22 independence protesters in Pakistani-administered Azad Kashmir, where he insisted there was “tolerance of dissent”. 
“They wanted to cross the line of control [to go to India-administered Kashmir] and in some incident, prior incidents … if they had crossed the line of control the Indians would have opened fire and killed them. This was the main reason [for the arrests]. I don’t have the latest information but I think they are being released.”"
146,terror,Friday briefing: UK spreads virus net wider as China seethes,"Top story: China doctor a ‘hero who told the truth’ 
Good morning, this is Graham Russell bringing you today’s news. 
The government has significantly widened its response to the coronavirus epidemic, urging travellers from a range of countries to isolate themselves if they feel ill, after a third Briton tested positive for the virus. Health officials added eight destinations including Thailand and Japan to the list of at-risk areas, after it emerged that a middle-aged man had contracted the virus in Singapore. Recent travellers with a cough, fever or shortness of breath were told to stay indoors and call NHS 111, “even if symptoms are mild”. 
In China the death of Li Wenliang, the doctor punished for sounding the alarm about the virus, has sparked fury at Beijing’s handling of the crisis, spiralling into calls for freedom of speech. “They owe you an apology, we owe you our gratitude. Take care, Dr Li,” said a Weibo post from Xiakedao, an account housed under the overseas edition of the People’s Daily, a Communist party outlet. Online posts about Li’s death were viewed more than 1.5bn views overnight, but were eclipsed views of posts translated as saying “we want freedom of speech” before they were censored. “In the eyes of the people, Dr Li was the hero who bravely told the truth,” said a state-affiliated financial newspaper, the Economic Observer.

From dock to centre stage – In 1999, following his impeachment trial, Bill Clinton said he was “profoundly sorry”. In 2020, Donald Trump took a decidedly different tack: “It was all bullshit,” he said in the East Room of the White House following his acquittal, blaming “dirty cops” in US intelligence for investigations into not only Ukraine but also his dealings with Russia. The president has begun his victory lap, Julian Borger writes, but there is plenty yet to come out on the Ukraine affair. In the meantime, says Tom McCarthy, it’s time to brace for a Trump unleashed, with suggestions his sights are set on controlling the justice department.

When the lists of nominees for the major film awards in 2020 were announced, there was, once again, a glaring anomaly. Not a single person of colour was nominated in the Baftas acting categories, while the Oscars managed only Cynthia Erivo for her part in Harriet. So what explains the glacial pace of change? Guardian arts and culture correspondent Lanre Bakare tells Anushka Asthana that there have been plenty of false dawns over the years in the quest for greater diversity.

147,terror,Extremists living in UK under secretive counter-terror programme,"More than 100 convicted and suspected terrorists living in the community are subject to a secretive government programme designed to stop the most entrenched extremists from endangering the public, the Guardian can reveal. The Home Office twice refused a Freedom of Information request by the Guardian but following a complaint to the data watchdog, the Information Commissioner’s Office, revealed that 116 people were subject to the desistance and disengagement programme (DDP) between October 2016 and September 2018. The release shows 30 individuals were enrolled from October 2016 to September 2017 and this nearly tripled in the year to September 2018 to 86. However, the first year was a trial of the programme, accounting for the sharp increase in the following year. Little is known about the DDP, although the government has made expanding the programme a key component of its refreshed counter-terrorism strategy.   Related: Mother A: returned Isis extremist subject to secretive counter-terror scheme    The programme, running since October 2016 as an arm of Prevent, targets all terrorism and terrorism-related offenders released from prison on probation licence. Anjem Choudary, the Islamist firebrand preacher, is reportedly a DDP subject. In addition, the DDP covers returnees from conflict zones in Syria or Iraq who are subject to a temporary exclusion order (TEO), which makes it unlawful for an individual to return to the UK without engagement with the authorities. Individuals subject to terrorism prevention and investigation measures (Tpims) – orders used to restrict people who are deemed a threat but cannot be prosecuted or deported if they are a foreign national – are also subject to the programme. The numbers roughly fit with official figures that show there were 96 prisoners convicted of terrorism offences released in 2017 and 2018. Nine people were subject to TEOs in 2017; figures are not yet available for 2018. In the government’s official counter-terrorism strategy, Contest, it describes the DDP: “Through the DDP, we provide a range of intensive, tailored interventions and practical support, designed to tackle the drivers of radicalisation around universal needs for identity, self-esteem, meaning and purpose; as well as to address personal grievances that the extremist narrative has exacerbated. “Support could include mentoring, psychological support, theological and ideological advice.” The Home Office hopes to double the number subject to the programme to 230 by June this year. Rajan Basra, a research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) at King’s College London, said: “Little information exists in the public domain on the DDP, but the general aim is to offer a more holistic approach to disengagement. “It recognises that disengagement from extremism isn’t just about ideology, and so the programme offers mentoring, family support, and other personal help alongside the theological input. “Even then, there’s no set formula for disengagement from extremism; it’s usually a gradual process, and given the varied challenges – which range from returnees from Syria to the homegrown radicalisation of jihadists as well as an emergent far-right – it requires resources, time, and patience. “The Home Office doesn’t release information on how successful it has been, though it’s important to remember that it’s still a relatively new program. It can take time to figure out what works, especially when each case is unique and in need of a tailored approach. “This issue is one that all of Europe is facing, where we’re seeing record numbers of extremists in prison, as well as the prospect of additional returnees from Syria. Those who have engaged in terrorism will eventually be released, so in anticipation we have to ask what are the most effective ways of managing the risks they pose.” The case of Shamima Begum, the teenage girl who fled her east London family for Syria after reading terrorist propaganda online, saw the issue of how to deal with returnees from Syria and Iraq subject to renewed scrutiny. Begum, who married an Isis fighter and had three children, all of whom died as infants, was stripped of her British citizenship and is living in a Syrian refugee camp. Similarly, the release of Choudary raised questions over how individuals convicted of terrorist offences are managed in the community. It is understood Choudary is among the 116 enrolled on the DDP. Prevent also includes Channel, a voluntary programme designed for people showing signs of extremism who are yet to meet a criminal threshold. It is understood the DDP is mandatory. Raffaello Pantucci​, director in International Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), said: “Channel is voluntary. They do that because if they force people to do these things they don’t always work. If someone doesn’t want to reject these ideas or get onto a different track, that’s quite difficult to do. Channel is about stopping people before they got there. “If they’ve already been radicalised and involved in terrorist activity then you’re talking about making sure they don’t re-engage with it’; that’s what the DDP is about. Making that mandatory makes sense.” He added: “People have realised trying to persuade someone to reject a fundamental idea they’ve absorbed is really difficult. “If we can steer a person away from what they’re doing – they’re often dealing with young men in an excitable moment of their lives – if you can give them something else to fill their time with that’s better. It’s same as an approach you see with gangs.” Last year, Guardian analysis revealed that police and security services face a surge in the number of convicted terrorists released from prison, raising questions about how such figures are managed in the community. More than 80 of the 193 terms issued for terrorism offences between 2007 and 2016 were completed by the end of last year. However, the number of individuals released could be much higher as prisoners are eligible for release halfway through their sentence. Melindy Brown, a lecturer in criminology at Birmingham City University, said measuring the success of programmes such as the DDP was complicated. “Because the DDP is quite secretive it’s quite difficult to say if it’s been effective,” Brown said. “The fact it is still in place … is a suggestion it’s obviously doing something right. “But previously, anything that has been done in terms of disengagement and reintegration of people, there haven’t really been any examples of anything that can truly say it has stopped someone from not engaging in that sort of behaviour. “How do we know if someone has truly desisted from a crime?” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Keeping the public safe is our first priority and an important part of this is working with individuals who have been radicalised to reintegrate them safely back into society. “Our desistance and disengagement programme is a critical part of our counter-terrorism strategy, Contest, providing a range of intensive, tailored interventions and practical support designed to rehabilitate and tackle the drivers of radicalisation.”"
148,terror,The Faculty of Indifference by Guy Ware review – dry comedy of counter-terrorism,"They go to the pub often, Exley and his workmates, to drink till their trains pull in. When Exley gets home his teenage son’s question is always the same: how was it today? “I could tell you,” Exley replies without fail, “but I’d have to kill you.” Yes, Exley’s a spook, working in counter-terrorism: he’s also a man who doesn’t like to tell anyone anything personal. He uses data and dawn raids to identify an assassin or catch a bombmaker. But nothing makes sense: not the police raid that uncovers explosives in the wrong London flat, not the encrypted diary through which his troubled son speaks to him, and not his wife’s death, years before, when she stepped off the pavement in front of a bus while he strapped their baby into his buggy.    The book is made brutally real both by spasms of violence and Ware’s fascination with the mundane    Ware, who won the London short-story prize in 2018, has an eye for the absurd and a taste for the off-kilter – his 2015 debut novel, The Fat of Fed Beasts, took in a bank heist, purgatory and bureaucracy. As you’d expect, his third novel is a similarly tricksy beast. Exley investigates a jumpsuited, Go-playing prisoner and uses works of classical philosophy to decode his son’s diary, while navigating office politics and ignoring his own ill health. The diary is mostly about Eyquem, a character based on Exley’s father, who watches beacons from a hilltop – and shares his name with a real-life criminal mastermind.   Related: Reconciliation by Guy Ware review – ingenious plotting in a seductive narrative    This might all sound a bit cerebral, and it is, but the book is made brutally real both by spasms of violence – slit bellies, bus-stop brawls and mass murder – and Ware’s fascination with the mundane. Routines are at this fine novel’s heart: beer rounds, paperwork, commutes, small talk and the olive-coloured office desks against which Exley desperately scratches himself instead of having an actual conversation with a doctor. The banal becomes eerie as Ware uncovers an alien terrain in “sheep-infested” countryside, the “glottal chug” of olive oil and the “butterscotch water” of the Thames. The Faculty of Indifference is a book of dark shadows and dry humour. It’s a comedy about torture, death and loneliness, and an existential drama about a world that swirls and twists and turns on us without provocation. It loses a little momentum as it moves to a close, but Ware’s strange, lyrical novel has real resonance, finding ordinary life as terrifying as the terrorists who threaten its destruction.  • The Faculty of Indifference by Guy Ware is published by Salt (£9.99).

149,terror,Things We Say in the Dark by Kirsty Logan review – an atmosphere of dread,"Frequently compared to Angela Carter for her luxuriant imagination and love of fairytales, Kirsty Logan shifts from the uncanny to the terrifying in her new collection of short stories. Its three sections, “The House”, “The Child” and “The Past”, focus on fears with particular resonance for women: unnatural children, lurking predators, inadequacy as a mother, and threats both within and without the home – and indeed the body. In between the stories are what purport to be authorial notes; the book is being composed in Iceland at a writing retreat where, we are told, “I decided I was ready to write about my fears.” Quickly, though, this construct is revealed as yet another fiction, with the “author” confessing to her own creeping terrors and sense of alienation. Her wife is not a fan of the project: “she doesn’t like horror. She tried to listen. But she stopped me before the end of the first story.” In “My House Is Out Where the Lights End”, one of the more straightforward chillers, nature exudes a patriarchal menace. A young woman returns to the house of her dead father: “Big Pop, terror of the town, half the teeth smacked out of his head.” The building is surrounded by the sunflowers only Big Pop could get to grow so far north, “their heavy heads like hoods on drooping necks, their leaves twitching like hands”. But Big Pop’s secret isn’t just green fingers. “Things My Wife and I Found Hidden in Our House” mixes the contemporary and folkloric as a couple unwittingly summon up a kelpie. Stories can be brief and impressionistic, leaving the reader with a nagging lack of closure; in “Half Sick of Shadows”, apparently caring parents find an apt way to rid themselves of a small child, for reasons unknown. The narrator of “The Only Thing I Can’t Tell You Is Why” believes her new baby is dead, even as he gurgles and burps. He grows up, “and he goes and gets a job and a wife and a house”, but his mother still “knows” her son is really dead. We’re left to wonder why; is she repelled by his maleness, perhaps? The author in the framing device grows increasingly introspective and gloomy as the book progresses. The final story, the grimmest of all, sets male oppression against female compliance, with an ending balancing hope and despair on a knife edge. There are strong individual stories here, but the book also works cumulatively, building up an impressive atmosphere of dread. • Things We Say in the Dark is published by Harvill Secker (£12.99).

150,terror,Extinction Rebellion guidance raises fresh concerns over Prevent,"The now recalled guidance issued by counter-terror police that placed Extinction Rebellion alongside the likes of jihadists and neo-Nazis emerged at a problematic time for the government’s flagship anti-radicalisation programme, Prevent. The voluntary initiative is supposed to be under independent review after years of concerns about its impact on certain communities and on freedom of expression. But just under a year after the review was announced by the Home Office, its chair, Lord Carlile, was forced to step down after a legal challenge to his appointment was brought on grounds of his partiality. The review was set to report back in August this year, but is currently without a leader and the clock is ticking. The criticism that prompted the review focused around three key themes: first, that the way the strategy is applied fosters discrimination against people of Muslim faith or background; second, its effectiveness (the last set of official figures revealed that still only one in 10 of referrals goes on to receive specialist support); and finally, that it inhibits legitimate expression. The last point is particularly pertinent given the fact that Extinction Rebellion and the environmental issues for which it campaigns were included on a list of “extremist ideologies”, which was then sent out to public sector partners, including teachers, who are under a legal obligation to refer the slightest suspicion that a person is vulnerable to said ideologies. Among evidence that a person may be vulnerable to Extinction Rebellion’s alleged extremist beliefs was speaking in “strong or emotive terms about environmental issues like climate change, ecology, species extinction, fracking, airport expansion or pollution”. Given the growing awareness of the climate emergency across the world – arguably due in part to the actions of Extinction Rebellion – this would make hundreds of thousands of people extremists. School strikers were singled out in the guidance – last year thousands of UK pupils, and millions worldwide, walked out of school in protest at government inaction on the climate crisis. The activist Greta Thunberg is a leading proponent of school strikes. This would have placed teachers – obliged to refer under the statutory duty, perhaps the most controversial element of the Prevent programme – under further pressure. The education sector is already the greatest single source of referrals to Prevent. Counter-terror police have been at pains to emphasise that Extinction Rebellion are not considered to be extremists and that the document was drawn up in error. Action has been taken to recall the document, but only after police were approached by the Guardian. It is also likely that the document, dated November last year, has been in circulation for around two months, and police chiefs are unable to say how many individuals and organisations received it. But there has already been at least one publicised case of an individual being referred to Prevent over their associations with Extinction Rebellion – Lyn Jenkins, a 69-year-old retired doctor, was referred by his NHS trust after telling them he wanted to be arrested during Extinction Rebellion protests. Prevent practitioners within police forces log every Prevent referral on a giant case management database – a database that the police insist was not a secret before the Guardian covered it last year, despite revealing that they do not inform individuals they are being listed on the database, pointing critics to a handful of buried references in highly obscure civil service documents online. For those concerned that they may have been referred to Prevent for their fears – and actions taken to address them – over the climate emergency, individuals are able to contact their relevant police force, ask if their details are held on the Prevent case management database, and then request that they be removed."
151,terror,Supporters of banned groups in UK face tougher sentences,"Tougher punishments for those convicted of expressing support for banned organisations or viewing terrorist material online are being proposed by the Sentencing Council. Following changes to legislation brought in by the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019, the official body, which publishes guidelines for judges, has circulated a fresh consultation on raising sentences for the most serious offences. The act increased maximum prison sentences for a range of terrorism offences. Consequently the Sentencing Council is recommending raising “sentence levels for the most serious examples of offending, where there was no headroom [previously] … due to the statutory maximum”. The council has in the past supported more punitive prison terms for terrorism in an era when “a terrorist act can be planned in a very short time, using readily available items as weapons, combined with online extremist material on websites which normalise terrorist activity”. The latest changes draw a distinction between an offender in a position of authority or influence who directly invites support for a proscribed organisation and one who expresses supportive views while being reckless as to whether others are encouraged to get involved. For those who intentionally express support for a proscribed organisation while holding a position of trust the starting point for judges imposing a prison sentence should be seven years, the new guidelines recommend. The culpability factors for those found guilty of collecting terrorist information have been amended to include offences committed by viewing or streaming terrorist information over the internet. For an offender who collects, makes a record of, possesses or views material that provides instruction for specific terrorist activity endangering life where harm is very likely to be caused, the judges’ starting point for sentencing those found guilty should be 10 years in custody, the guidelines propose. Mr Justice Julian Goose, a member of the Sentencing Council, said: “Terrorism offences are extremely serious and can cover a wide range of factual circumstances, making them difficult and sensitive offences to sentence. For this reason, the council is keen to ensure that the guidelines are kept up to date and fit for purpose “These revised guidelines will ensure consistency and transparency in the sentencing of these offences.” The consultation runs from 22 October to 3 December. If confirmed, the revised guidelines will apply to offenders aged 18 years and above and will come into effect in early 2020."
152,terror,'We are not safe': India's Muslims tell of wave of police brutality,"It was midnight at a police barracks in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and in a freezing windowless room about 150 Muslim men and boys sat huddled, bloodied and bruised. Some of the shivering prisoners had raw gashes across their hands and faces, others had broken limbs splayed out at awkward angles. The beatings from police came frequently, according to multiple corresponding accounts; to those who asked for water or closed their eyes in drowsiness or simply did nothing at all. Over and over, metal rods and bamboo canes hit soft human skin. Some had been stripped of their clothes. The youngest among them was just 12 years old, said witnesses. How hundreds of innocent Muslim residents of the city of Muzaffarnagar came to be rounded up on 20 December, before being tortured in police detention, is part of what Indian activist and academic Yogendra Yadav described as an unprecedented and ruthless “reign of terror” imposed upon the country’s most populous state over the past two weeks. Since last month, India has been engulfed in the biggest nationwide protests in over four decades. People of all religions, classes, castes and ages took to the streets in opposition to a new citizenship amendment act (CAA) passed by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and his Hindu nationalist BJP government, which many say discriminates against Muslims and undermines India’s secular foundations. The government has dealt with the dissent with increasing repression, with authorities banning gatherings of more than four people and demonstrators met with batons and tear gas.   Related: India: largest protests in decades signal Modi may have gone too far    Nowhere has the crackdown been so brutal and so openly communal against the Muslim communitythan in Uttar Pradesh. According to accounts given to the Guardian by dozens of victims, witnesses and activists, police in the state stand accused of a string of allegations: firing indiscriminately into crowds; beating Muslim bystanders in the streets; raiding and looting Muslim homes while shouting Islamophobic slurs and Hindu nationalist slogans; detaining and torturing Muslim children. The allegations further include forcing signed confessions and filing bogus criminal charges against thousands of Muslims who had never been to a protest. Hundreds of Muslims and activists remain behind bars across Uttar Pradesh and thousands have been placed on police lists. And the orders, it appears, come from the very top. BJP state chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, a militant Hindu nationalist notorious for his open hatred and persecution of Muslims, pledged to take revenge on protesters in the wake of the unrest. The police took him at his word. “It was kristallnacht for Muslims,” said activist Kavita Krishnan, describing the events that unfolded across the state on Friday 20 and Saturday 21 December. That day in Muzaffarnagar, trouble began when a peaceful demonstration against the citizenship act turned violent as police clashed with protesters. Stones were pelted and vehicles were set alight. In response, police opened fire on the crowds. Nearby, maulana Asad Raza Hussaini, a respected Muslim cleric, and his students at Sadaat Madrasa, an Islamic seminary, were resting after afternoon prayers when about 50 police officers, bearing batons and iron rods, broke down the doors and burst in. They were allegedly looking for people who had taken part in the protest but upon entering the madrasa began violently smashing everything in their pathway.     Ruqaiya Parveen, 22, suffered a deep gash on her head, when police barged into her house in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, on 20 December, and beat up several members of the family. Photograph: Shaikh Azizur Rahman    “The maulana told the policemen gently that none from the seminary took part in any protest rally and pleaded for them not to vandalise the Qur’an centre in the madrasa,” said a neighbour who witnessed the police attack but did not want to be identified for fear of reprisal. “It was then that the policemen and Rapid Action Force personnel [a branch of the police that deals with crowd control] pounced on him.”  The police then rounded up Hussaini and 35 of his students, 15 of whom were under 18 and mostly orphans, and took them to a nearby police barracks. Here the cleric was, witnesses allege, stripped of his clothes, beaten and a rod shoved up his anus, causing rectal bleeding, while the students were allegedly tortured with bamboo rods and made to shout Hindu nationalist slogans Jai Shri Ram” [Hail Lord Ram] and “Har Har Mahadev” [Save us Lord Shiva]. “The maulana had been beaten up very badly and was left without a single cloth on his body and when he was released we found him in very bad shape,” said Salman Saeed, a local Congress leader who came to pick up Hussaini and several students from Civil Lines Barracks. “He was badly wounded and bloodied, with many bruises across his body. He could not stand up on his legs and was bare-bodied. We were shocked to see the maulana in that condition. He is bed-ridden now.” While Hussaini and all his underage students were released at 2am that night, 12 adults students and the madrasa cook remain behind bars and have been charged with taking part in violence, despite never partaking in a protest. The young students were not the only underage Muslim prisoners in Muzaffarnagar police barracks that night. Upon seeing the commotion in the streets, 14-year-old Mohammad Sadiq, who worked as a mason’s assistant, set out to find his 11-year-old brother. Cars and motorcycles had been set alight and as protesters were fleeing around him, he too began to run. It was then that a dozen police pounced on him, hitting his legs with batons to make him fall to the ground and then unleashing a torrent of blows, he said. “The police said to me, ‘if you tell us the names of 100 Muslims involved in the riots we will stop beating you’,” recounted Sadiq, as he lay bed-bound and weak from his injuries in his one-room family shack. “I kept telling them I had nothing to do with the riots, that I did not know anything but they kept beating me. The policemen told me to shout ‘Jai Sri Ram’ and I told them I would not so they put an iron rod into the flames of the car that was on fire and then held it against my hands to burn me.” “Then some of the police officers tried to pick me up and put me in the flames of the car on fire,” Sadiq said, “but two of them said ‘no, let’s just take him to the police station’.” Sadiq was kept in police detention for the next four days. Stripped to his underwear, he said he was tortured. For two days he was given no food or water and no medical treatment for his badly bleeding wounds. When he was finally released his condition was so bad his mother, Rehana Begum, fainted when she came to collect him. “His father is dead so he was the only earning member of this house but he has been beaten so badly across the knees he can not walk and can not work now so what will happen to us?” she said, her head in her hands.     Cars of a Muslim politician were set ablaze inMuzaffarnagar on December 20. Photograph: Shaikh Azizur Rahman    According to multiple accounts, in the late-night raids on Muslim homes carried out in Muzaffarnagar and across the state over those two days, women, children and the elderly were not spared the brunt of the police brutality. One such victim was 73-year-old Hamid Hasan, who was viciously beaten when police stormed into his house late on 20 December, using metal batons to attack him, his 65-year-old wife and his 22-year-old granddaughter, Ruqaiya Parveen, who was hit so hard across the head she collapsed from the wound and had to have 16 stitches. Hasan wiped away tears as he showed the wrecked remnants of the wedding gifts purchased for his granddaughter’s forthcoming marriage, including a destroyed television, ripped sofa, overturned fridge and smashed air-conditioning unit he had saved up his whole life to buy. “My family did not take part in any protests, why would they do this to us,” wailed Hasan, who could barely walk from his injuries. “Muslims in this country are being made to live in fear, even in our homes we are not safe from violence now.” Hasan’s 14-year-old grandson Mohammad Ahmad was also dragged from his bed by the officers, beaten in the street and then detained and allegedly tortured by police in the police barracks, along with Hasan’s son Mohammad Sajid, 40. Ahmad recounted how he witnessed officers force his uncle Sajid to sign a confession that a gun and bullets had been found in the police raid on their home. “He did not want to sign it but he had to because we were terrified,” whispered Ahmad softly, his legs still wrapped in bandages from the beatings. After 24 hours Ahmad was released back to his family, but Sajid remains behind bars, his medical condition worsening by the day.  Official figures put the protest death toll in the state at 17. All were Muslim and the youngest was eight. Activists allege a deliberate obfuscation by the police around these deaths, with none of the families given postmortem reports. The sole fatality in Muzaffarnagar on 20 December was Noor Mohammad, 26, a day-wage labourer who was shot over half a kilometre away from where the protests took place. Police allege he was killed by protesters. His wife, 23-year-old Sanno Begum, who is seven months pregnant with their second child, wept as she said all she wanted was “justice for my husband and my daughter”. “If they are not giving us the postmortem report, then it must be the police who shot him. I want justice from the government. I have got a little daughter. I have no one to support us now,” she said through tears. Not only did the police force the family to bury Noor 60km (40 miles) away from Muzaffarnagar, but they accompanied the body to the ground, prevented proper funeral rites being carried out and then confiscated the burial certificate from the family. “It is clear they want to destroy all evidence about his death,” said his brother-in-law Mohammad Salim. The Muzaffarnagar police did not make themselves available for comment. Over 500km across the state in the city of Kanpur, Mohammad Sharif, 74, sobbed as he described how his son Mohammad Raees, 30, died on 20 December in the crossfire of a protest. Raees had been working that day, washing utensils for a wedding, when he wandered out to see the commotion in the street and was hit by a police bullet. “He was not a protester, he was killed because he was Muslim,” said Sharif. “I want to die. Why I am alive when he is not? How can we go on living now?” Almost two weeks have passed since the night of the raids but the climate of fear has not eased, with many abandoning their homes altogether. After the Guardian met with two activists in Kanpur this week, they were called into the police station and threatened with being charged with sedition if they spoke to the media again. They subsequently requested their identities be kept anonymous.  The Uttar Pradesh government insist its actions were justified. “Every rioter is thinking they made a big mistake by challenging Yogi ji’s government after seeing strict actions taken by it against rioters,” said the chief minister’s office in a recent series of twitter posts. “Every rioter is shocked. Every demonstrator is stunned. Everyone has been silenced.” Shaikh Azizur Rahman contributed to this report"
153,terror,"Police cuts pose greatest risk to countering terrorism, says ex-chief","A former head of counter-terrorism has said cuts to police numbers, not the length of sentences, have played the greater role in jeopardising public safety. Robert Quick, who led Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command from 2008-9, rejected claims made by Boris Johnson after last Friday’s attack at London Bridge in which a terrorist killed two people before being shot dead by police. The prime minister had sought to blame the Labour government, which left power in 2010, for Usman Khan being free. He was jailed over a terrorist plot in 2012 and released in December last year, halfway through his sentence, under tough conditions but without checks as to his suitability.   Related: Johnson's response to London Bridge attack ignores complex reality    However, Quick said on Tuesday that the fight against terrorism had been damaged by large reductions made to police funding by the Conservative government since 2010. “In the 2000s the police worked hard to rebuild neighbourhood policing, with a clear local presence, with staff who were visible and accessible,” he said. “A lot of that has been cut back heavily. “These are the eyes and ears of the counter-terrorism efforts. It is the foundation stone of security and counter-terrorism and has been broken up in the last 10 years.” Dedicated counter-terrorism officers escaped the effects of austerity but Quick said this was only part of what was needed to minimise the dangers posed by terrorists to the UK’s defences. “The counter-terrorism infrastructure has been very relatively left alone by austerity – it’s had to be through necessity. “The investigative side is good, but once [attackers] are radicalised and cross the Rubicon, the ability to deal with that after arrest and prosecution is very much wanting. “Counter-terrorism relies on the local intelligence feed from local police divisions. It has been undermined, without doubt, by the reduction of policing presence in communities. “How we are policing those communities and the connection with communities, seems to have been undermined by austerity.” Speaking about the effect of sentencing laws on Khan’s attack, Quick said: “It is one case and we do not have enough detail to make sweeping judgments about it. We certainly know a lot about the effects of police cuts.”     The comments were made by Robert Quick, pictured here in 2012. Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images    On Johnson, he said: “I can’t see much substance in what he says. They are rather tired, almost cliched, remarks that are made in the wake of these tragedies.” Quick said the Khan case had “called into question” government policy on how to assess prisoners before release, as well as resources in jails. Khan was on a multi-agency public protection arrangement, which would have involved representatives from police, prison and probation sectors managing him in the community. The probation sector was separated in 2014 into a public sector organisation managing high-risk criminals and 21 private companies responsible for the supervision of 150,000 low- to medium-risk offenders under a widely derided overhaul spearheaded by the then justice secretary, Chris Grayling. After years of damning criticism from MPs, inspectorates and former probation officers, the government decided to bring all offender management under the publicly run National Probation Service (NPS) by spring 2021. The changes took place against a backdrop of 40% real-terms cuts to the Ministry of Justice budget. Meanwhile the general secretary of the National Association of Probation Officers (Napo), Ian Lawrence, has said that while there was no evidence that the probation service failed to supervise the licence conditions to which Khan was subjected, the issue of community safety could not be divorced from the cuts made to the sector. “From what we know, [Khan] was given the highest possible supervision plan for someone who has committed that offence,” he said. “Beyond that he would have been given the highest level of supervision that would have involved two or three visits a week with a probation officer. “On the other hand you can’t divorce the issue of community safety from the reality of what the probation service going through at the moment. While we welcome the movement of 80% of the work back to probation from the private sector, that is going to bring additional pressures.” He said there were 1,000 vacancies in the NPS, with particularly high rates in the Mids division. “Their staff are facing extraordinarily high workloads. In some cases, 120%, 130% caseloads, and in some cases I’ve heard people having to do two jobs [because they are] helping those on long-term sick.” He said work was being done to recruit new probation workers but that many new officers did not stay in the job for more than a few months. “We are working hard with leadership in probation to make the profession more attractive but it comes down to resources … It may be that communication can become disjointed between various agencies – these will come out in a review.”"
154,terror,Brussels Jewish museum terror attack: French citizen convicted,"A French citizen suspected of being a member of Islamic State has been convicted over a terror attack carried out in Belgium in 2014. Mehdi Nemmouche was found guilty of terrorist murder over the shootings of four people at a Jewish museum in Brussels – the first attack carried out in Europe by a jihadist returning from fighting in Syria. An Israeli couple, Miriam and Emmanuel Riva, a young Belgian employee of the museum, Alexandre Strens, and a French volunteer, Dominique Sabrier, all died in the attack. Nemmouche, who appeared in court with his beard trimmed and wearing a navy blue jumper on Thursday, now faces a life sentence. The 33-year-old showed no emotion and stared into space as the verdict was delivered. Sentencing could be as early as Friday. The 12 jurors, accompanied by the presiding judge and two other magistrates, had deliberated for more than two days in secret at a Brussels hotel before returning their verdict. Nemmouche was found to have killed the four victims in cold blood in less than 90 seconds in the antisemitic attack on 24 May 2014. He denied the accusation, telling the court he had been “tricked”. Defence lawyers argued that Nemmouche was not to blame for the killings, but that he was caught up in a plot targeting the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad. The legal argument had centred on the Rivas, the first two of the four people killed. According to the defence, the museum shooting was not the work of Isis, and the Israeli couple were in fact Mossad agents murdered by another man who had hunted them down. The Riva family’s lawyers have furiously rejected the theory, and said attempts to pass off the tourists as secret agents were “an absolute scandal”. “Let’s stop the joking,” prosecutor Yves Moreau told the court this week, describing the defence’s arguments as “complete nonsense”. Miriam Riva worked for Mossad but, as an accountant, she was not operational, said the investigating judges, who travelled to Israel during their investigation. Yohan Benizri, the head of Belgium’s Coordinating Committee of Jewish Organisations, denounced what he called a “nauseating conspiracy theory”. The 12 jurors also found fellow Frenchman Nacer Bendrer, 30, who was accused of supplying the weapons, to be the co-author of the attack. Six days after the massacre, Nemmouche was arrested in the French city of Marseille in possession of a revolver and a Kalashnikov-type assault rifle. At the trial, Bendrer admitted that Nemmouche had asked him for a Kalashnikov when he came to Brussels in early April, but claimed he never delivered it. Upon arrest, Nemmouche possessed a nylon jacket with gunshot residue, as well as a computer with six videos claiming the attack and featuring an off-camera voiceover thought to be by him. The jury also heard testimony last month from two French journalists who were held hostage by Isis in Syria and identified Nemmouche as one of their captors.  The journalists described him as deeply antisemitic, sadistic and full of hatred. Nemmouche faces separate charges in France for his role in keeping the reporters in captivity Agence France-Presse in Brussels contributed to this report."
155,terror,"Anxious and in pain, survivors of Christchurch massacre call for new approach","“What happened is unusual, and for unusual things, there should be unusual rules.” Hisham al Zarzour survived the Christchurch massacre in March, when 51 people were killed by a gunman who entered two mosques during Friday prayers and opened fire. But his struggle isn’t over. Nearly nine months on, he is among victims of the attack who are calling for a new approach and more understanding from the government, which has promised long-term support but has not always delivered what survivors say they need. “They can’t deal with unusual things in normal ways,” he says. Al Zarzour, 33, sits in bright sunlight outside his Christchurch home, his three children shrieking happily as they play around him. In April, he was too nervous to leave his house for the physiotherapy appointments needed to recover from bullet wounds sustained to his leg when he was shot by the gunman in Al Noor mosque. Sometimes he slept on the floor, afraid he might be shot through the window. He had lived in New Zealand for seven months before the gunman stormed two mosques in the South Island city. The Syrian man was one of dozens who were injured, and suffered a heart attack in the weeks after the shootings. Since then, things have improved in fits and starts: he now sleeps for brief spells every night, waking up two or three times with nightmares – months earlier, he would sometimes go two days at a time without rest. “My personality is changed now,” he says. “I get angry quickly, and I’m not social like before.” According to a Christchurch-based organisation that has conducted about 100 recent meetings with victims of the attacks, the bereaved and survivors still face a litany of problems: financial stress from closed businesses and terminated incomes – many of those killed were the breadwinners in their families – life-long physical injuries and mental trauma. Some are still wrestling with New Zealand’s immigration agency, or confronting a lack of cultural understanding from officials designated to work with them.   Related: After Christchurch, kindness is the only way to live each day    Raf Manji is a former Christchurch city councillor who is now advising the Christchurch Foundation, the independent charity that carried out the recent interviews. After more than 160 conversations, Manji said it was clear how much support the community still needed, and how much trust needed to be rebuilt after missteps and misunderstandings following the attacks. He has recommended New Zealand’s government consider a “flexible, bespoke” system of financial support system that runs for at least two years after the shooting, more information-sharing between government agencies, culturally competent support workers, and a long-term mental health and trauma hub – as was established in response to the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing. “Government agencies were told to be flexible, and they certainly were in the frontline strategy,” he said, of the numerous departments – including health, social welfare, compensation, and immigration – that had to work together to meet survivors’ needs following the attack. But, he added, they had eventually “hit walls” in terms of how much help they could provide.     Raf Manji is a former Christchurch city councillor Photograph: Raf Manji    “One thing I often heard … is that they don’t want to set a precedent.” “The precedent has been set by the mere fact that we have had a mass casualty terror attack. You will not get a bigger precedent than that,” Manji says. Megan Woods, the minister responsible for the government’s response to the attacks, said in an emailed statement: “This attack was unlike any other in the history of our country, and providing appropriate support for the victims is a complex task but one that it is vital we get right.” She cited the “dedicated and personalised case managers” each family had been assigned, and added that it was important to balance information-sharing requests between government agencies with “respecting the privacy of victims and their families”.     Megan Woods Photograph: Elias Rodriguez/Getty Images    ‘There has to be integration’ The government faced extraordinary challenges in responding to the attacks, partly because not all of the community had integrated into New Zealand life, and many did not understand how systems worked, said Zhiyan Basharati, an advocate for the victims in Christchurch who has worked with dozens of victims’ families to raise their complaints with officials. Sometimes translators provided at meetings did not understand government systems either. “If we’re going to bring people into the country, we need to make sure that they are integrating, that they feel safe, that there is no fear,” said Basharati, whose family settled in New Zealand as Kurdish refugees in 2001. “And to achieve that outcome, there has to be integration.” Woods agreed in her statement that “issues around assimilation and integration have come to the fore for the community in the months after the attacks”.   Related: Christchurch royal commission extended after receiving more than 1,000 submissions    The Christchurch Foundation’s interviews with members of the community came as the organisation prepared to distribute NZ$9m donated from around the world since March; Manji wanted the community’s advice on what to do with the funds. Such questions have proved fraught. Many victims said an earlier round of more than NZ$10m raised by New Zealand charity Victim Support was disbursed without consulting them. Basharati, the community advocate, said the agency and other bodies had relied too much on the same handful of local community leaders, and the conversations had not filtered down to those most affected. “Some individuals who are part of the boards, some of them have never seen the faces of the victims. They’ve never spoken to them,” she said. “You go individually, you speak to them, you go to their house, you give them respect individually.” Some community members criticised a decision to exclude those present at the mosques – but who were not shot – from most of the earlier funding. Others decried the ruling that those with severe, life-changing injuries – a woman paralysed, a man who might lose his hand – were given the same amounts as those with less serious wounds. The Christchurch Foundation plans, after the conversations with victims, to make payouts to the bereaved families and those shot in the attacks, and to set aside extra funding for the medical costs of those most seriously injured. Other tranches of money are set aside for children’s education, hardship, and community initiatives. Some of the most severely injured were still recovering in hospital when the first round of funding was distributed, and their voices were absent from the conversations, said Basharati. In one case, a 25-year-old woman who was paralysed in the attack had been discharged from the hospital to a property that did not accommodate her needs, and had to be driven across the city every time she needed to shower. The government’s housing agency had been in the process of making modifications to a home for the woman and her husband to move into, but Basharati said she had visited the property and found it was in “revolting” condition. Manji said when Basharati told him the situation, he helped arrange for the woman’s compensation to be released to her early, and assembled a team of people – including a lawyer who spoke the woman’s first language, and representatives of a local bank – so the woman and her husband could put down a deposit on their own home. ‘This will cost a lot of money’     New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern after Friday prayers at Hagley Park outside Al-Noor mosque in Christchurch in the days after the massacre Photograph: Jorge Silva/Reuters    Talking to survivors from month to month reveals the volatile nature of their situations, and the starkly different challenges each family faces. Al Zarzour’s parents and brother have arrived in New Zealand to help him and his wife and children, and are likely to be able to stay long term, providing the government approves visas for them. The presence of his relatives had been comforting and helpful, he said, but “more responsibility” too; once their visas are processed, he must help them find jobs and a place to live. “They are my family, and it is my responsibility to find for them a house to rent and buy a car and then to buy the things in the house,” says al Zarzour, who survived after the shootings on donated grocery vouchers. “This will cost a lot of money.” His landlord has told him he must vacate his rental home by April, so he must also find a new house for his family of five. He is barred from his previous work as a plasterer due to his injury and is retraining to be a social worker. The worst thing for many survivors is the uncertainty; some who are likely to be among the most severely affected do not yet know the outcomes of their medical situations. “We need to think about people who have bullet particles in their body, because if that bullet particle shifts, they could need emergency surgery,” says Basharati, who believes more work should be done to track the victims and their needs. “I mean, I get that this is the first time New Zealand has been going through something like this. But we’re not idiots.” One of those whose future is in limbo is Ahmed Jahangir, the chairman of Linwood mosque – the second the gunman attacked – who is a good-humoured man with his arm in a sling and big dimples when he smiles. Jahangir, who was shot in the shoulder and has lost the use of his right hand, will not know for another year whether more treatment might help. For now, someone else is running the Indian restaurant that was his pride and joy.He is full of praise for how government officials dealt with his case, but his future, and that of his young family and his business, are up in the air. “As of now, I haven’t planned anything for the next year after this,” he says. “I’m just taking it as it comes. No certainty yet.”"
156,terror,Tory MEP's motives for delaying EU terror legislation questioned,"A Conservative MEP has had his motives questioned by the EU’s executive after delaying a vote on Brussels legislation that would force online platforms to remove terrorist content. In a letter from the European commission to Dan Dalton, leaked to the Guardian, the EU’s executive called on him to “rise to the occasion” and lamented “time lost”, with the current parliament to have its final session in April. The commission’s proposal, which is backed by the British government, would set a one-hour limit on the removal of terrorist content from the time at which it has been reported. If in breach of the regulation, platforms could be fined up to 4% of their global turnover. Dalton is the “rapporteur” for the legislation, responsible for finding a majority on his parliamentary committee and putting the draft to a vote to allow it to progress towards becoming law. In his letter to the MEP, the British security commissioner, Sir Julian King, described the issue as a “matter of urgency” in light of the failure of online platforms to swiftly take down footage of the terrorist attack in New Zealand. “We have been asking internet companies to show responsibility in tackling terrorist content online, but we also need to rise to the occasion,” the commissioner wrote to Dalton. “There is still a possibility for the co-legislators to reach agreement on this vital proposal during this mandate of the European parliament. We therefore urge you to take the necessary steps to that end, in the interest of the security of all citizens.” King told reporters in an aside during a press conference in Brussels earlier this week that he had “difficulty understanding the motivation of colleagues in the European parliament who are seeking to delay and time-out our outstanding legislative proposal on a regulation on terrorist content online”. Sources close to Dalton, who in 2017 had his hotel and transport costs paid for by Google during a two-day trip to Zurich, said the MEP had held off from holding a vote on the proposal as he did not believe there was yet sufficient support to allow it to pass. But the legislation needs to be passed by the civil liberties committee before being voted on by the chamber as a whole, with time short before the end of the parliamentary term. Sources on the committee said they had implored Dalton to ask his colleagues to vote on the issue, so it might be passed on along its legislative journey towards becoming law, but the MEP had declined. The legislation is expected to be put to a vote on 1 April. The Counter Extremism Project, a non-governmental organisation, has also written to Dalton expressing its “deep disappointment”. Dalton, who will be without a job once the UK has left the EU, said in a statement: “The commission clearly wants another piece of legacy legislation before [Jean-Claude] Juncker’s mandate ends. But it’s not up to them to tell directly elected MEPs when they should be voting on something. “This draft law raises huge questions about free speech. We first need to bridge the gaps between the different political parties, but the aim is to find a compromise soon.” A spokesman for Dalton said no considerations beyond the need to construct cross-party support for the legislation had caused him to delay putting it to a vote. The trip to Google’s offices in Zurich had been arranged by the EU40 initiative, an organisation that seeks to expand the horizons of MEPs under the age of 40. The trip involved a visit to the Cern research laboratory. The costs of Dalton’s hotel – the Marriott in Zurich – and travel by coach were met by Google. He paid for his flight home and the visit was declared in the appropriate way."
157,terror,The rising tide of white nationalist terror – the 9 August edition of the Guardian Weekly,"It’s a dance as old as Columbine. Last Saturday morning, a gunman entered a Walmart store in the border city of El Paso, Texas, and shot dozens of people, killing at least 22. Hours later, another killer wearing body armour and carrying 100-bullet magazines shot nine people in Dayton, Ohio, and would have killed dozens more if he had not been shot by police within a minute. There have been more mass shootings in America this year than there have been days – and everyone knows what happens next: condemnation from Republican politicians before they proceed to block any significant gun controls. But the shooting in El Paso has opened up another debate. A racist manifesto that appeared to be linked to the El Paso shooting seemed to make it clear that racist violence by white terrorists has become a global problem – from Utøya, Norway, to Christchurch, New Zealand, and now Texas. This week’s cover stories look at Donald Trump’s predictably flimsy response to the white nationalist violence that has been fomented under his presidency and investigate the rise of a global network of white supremacist terror.  In Turkey, civic elections in Istanbul have proved a focal point of resistance to president Erdoğan. Could Moscow’s local elections prove a turning point in Russian politics? That’s the hope of anti-Putin figures such as Alexei Navalny and Lyubov Sobol. Sobol has been on hunger strike after not being allowed to stand as an independent candidate in elections to the city parliament. In late July protests about access to the election boiled over with the largest number of protest arrests in recent history.

158,terror,Bahrain court sentences 139 to jail in mass terror trial,"A court in Bahrain has handed down prison sentences to 139 people, including 69 life sentences, for terrorism offences after one of the biggest mass trials in the country’s history. All but one also had their citizenship revoked, the public prosecutor, Ahmad al-Hammadi, said in a statement on Tuesday. Local news outlets said the defendants were accused of building a cell called “Bahraini Hezbollah”, similar to the Lebanese armed group funded by Iran, in order to sow discord in the Gulf kingdom. Some had trained in Iran, Lebanon and Iraq, “at the behest of Iranian regime leaders who ordered the Iranian Revolutionary Guard elements to unify the Bahrain-based terrorist elements to carry out their plots and acts of terrorism against Bahrain,” Hammadi said. Those tried were found guilty of training with and using illegal weapons and explosives, detonating bombs and attempted murder, and other sentences handed down ranged from between three and 10 years. All the detainees are believed to be members of the Sunni-ruled country’s Shia majority, which has long accused the kingdom of discriminating against them. Thirty defendants were acquitted, Hammadi said. Fifty-eight of the defendants were tried in absentia, a judicial source told Agence France-Presse. According to rights groups, Bahrain is increasingly using terrorism-related charges and the removal of citizenship to crack down on mostly peaceful political activists. Opposition members and rights activists have been jailed or fled, and authorities have denied multiple accusations of torture. Since new laws were introduced in 2012 after the previous year’s Arab Spring protests, 990 people have had their Bahraini citizenship revoked, 180 of them in 2019 alone, and mass trials have become commonplace. In February, 167 people who were arrested in 2017 at a sit-in outside the home of Bahrain’s leading Shia cleric were sentenced to between six months and 10 years in prison. Last May, 115 people were stripped of their citizenship after a single trial. Their sentences were upheld in January. Last September, 169 people were also charged with being members of Bahraini Hezbollah. Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, an advocacy director at the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, said the ruling on Tuesday was the biggest single case of citizenship stripping since 2012. “Today’s trial is a dark stain on Bahrain’s history and marks a tragic moment in the ongoing crackdown on civil liberties in Bahrain,” he told the Guardian. “Most … of the men convicted seem to have had their citizenship revoked, rendering them stateless, and all appear to be from Bahrain’s Shia community. The unabated revocation of citizenship sets a very dangerous precedent for the future of Bahraini society.”   Related: Hakeem al-Araibi: power, politics, football and the will of the people    Amnesty International condemned the court’s decision, calling it a “mockery of justice”. Lynn Maalouf, the organisation’s Middle East research director, said: “Arbitrarily stripping people of their citizenship and rendering citizens stateless are blatant violations of international law. Bahrain’s authorities must immediately stop relying on these unlawful measures as punishment.” It was not immediately clear whether the detainees stripped of Bahraini citizenship would be deported or where they could go. In 2018, eight Bahrainis whose citizenship had been revoked for “damaging state security” were sent to Iraq. Since the 2011 pro-democracy uprising, there have been sporadic outbreaks of violence including bomb attacks in Bahrain, a western-allied island state that is home to the US navy’s fifth fleet. The country accuses Iran of stoking Shia militancy inside its borders by providing training and weapons to various armed groups. Tehran supported the Arab Spring protests in the country but has repeatedly denied backing local militant groups that have carried out attacks on security forces."
159,terror,Mike Bloomberg has a terrible past. Will his money stop scrutiny of it?,"During his tenure as mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg oversaw one of the most discriminatory surveillance programs in our nation’s history. His police department’s “Demographics Unit” mapped out Muslim American communities and infiltrated and spied on everything from kebab shops to Muslim student whitewater rafting trips. Not only was the program offensive to American values – even the then New Jersey Republican governor, Chris Christie, an ally of President Trump’s, was outraged upon learning of it – it did nothing to keep New Yorkers safe. The Demographics Unit’s work did not generate a single terror lead. But Bloomberg himself has always been unapologetic, insisting the program was justified. During the 2016 Democratic national convention, Bloomberg was given a primetime speaking role. Working with a colleague, I interviewed many key Democrats – from members of Congress to representatives of the Clinton campaign – and asked them if Bloomberg should at least apologize for overseeing this program. Almost no Democrat I talked to would call on Bloomberg to apologize – foreshadowing his growing power over the party. Bloomberg has come under fire from activists for his role in implementing the stop and frisk program, where police were directed to stop, question and pat down hundreds of thousands of innocent people, mostly African American and Latino, as part of the mayor’s signature gun control program. There’s plenty of other reasons for Democrats to be skeptical of Bloomberg. For one, he is only a part-time member of their party, having served as a Republican mayor of New York City. He endorsed George W Bush and the Iraq war, and gave money to Rudy Giuliani’s presidential campaign. He tried to keep Elizabeth Warren out of the Senate by supporting the Republican senator Scott Brown. He spent millions of dollars re-electing Michigan’s Republican governor, Rick Snyder, who oversaw the state’s failed response to the Flint water crisis. As recently as 2018, he was funding some GOP congressional campaigns. And yet at the very same time, he is facing very little criticism from the Democratic party’s establishment. “I think that his involvement in this campaign will be a positive one,” said the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, one of the country’s most powerful Democratic party figures. Not long after the stop and frisk controversy resurfaced, a slew of African American politicians endorsed Bloomberg. The reason Bloomberg is able to float above criticism is because he’s the eighth richest person in the country. In 2018, he spent $100m backing various House Democrats in their congressional races. One of his gun control groups spent $4.5m electing Lucy McBath, the African American Georgia congresswoman who endorsed Bloomberg in the midst of the latest stop and frisk controversy. Some of those who have supported Bloomberg recently were not even shy about why they were so forgiving of his record on policing issues.    Bloomberg’s ability to buy silence presents a challenge not only to the Democrats, but to democracy itself    Calvin Butts, a Harlem pastor who came to Bloomberg’s aid in February, admitted that Bloomberg gave him money for his economic development operation. “He used his money, which is one of the reasons I continue to support him, to express his sincerity,” Butts said bluntly. Bloomberg’s ability to buy silence presents a challenge not only to the Democrats, but to democracy itself, because while American democracy can’t be snuffed out by brute force, it can be drowned by money. Bloomberg has spent over $350m on his presidential campaign so far, deploying a barrage of television ads and endorsements that has rocketed him to third place in national polls. If he became president, he would not only control the world’s most powerful government office, he would be able to tap into a $50bn fortune to bend both major parties to his will. Recall that Bernie Sanders needed to amass 1.4 million donors to raise $100m. That’s a rounding error in Bloomberg’s bank account. The mayor’s defenders are likely to point out that he is known to be an efficient, data-driven leader who brought down New York City’s crime rate and improved school graduation rates. Indeed, “Mike Will Get It Done” is the campaign’s slogan. It’s hardly a surprise that Bloomberg is on record defending the Chinese system of government, insisting that Xi Jinping is “not a dictator”. Bloomberg sees himself as an enlightened autocrat, who uses his money to get around inefficient democratic processes. But the people who built our democracy – from the suffragettes of Seneca Falls to the men who stormed Normandy – believed, as Abraham Lincoln did, that our government is “of the people, by the people, and for the people”. The people are imperfect, and democracy is messy, which may be why Bloomberg thinks he can replace our democratic process with the process of writing a check. We’re about to find out if Americans let him."
160,terror,Canadian minor charged with terror-related crimes,"Police in Canada have charged a minor with terrorism-related offences, after a Thursday evening raid on two properties in eastern Ontario which was part of a national security investigation that also involved the FBI. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police – Canada’s federal police force – said an adult male was also arrested in Kingston, Ontario, but was not charged. The minor, who cannot be named, has been charged with “knowingly facilitating a terrorist activity” and “counselling a person to deliver, place, discharge or detonate an explosive … in or against a place of public use with intent to cause death or serious bodily injury”, the RCMP said in a statement. “There was an attack planned,” Michael LeSage, a chief superintendent with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, told reporters at a press conference in Kingston on Friday. “At no time was there a direct threat to public safety.” Police said they received “credible information” about a terror threat in December 2018 from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but there was no specific location or time of the planned attack.   Related: Revealed: Canada uses massive US anti-terrorist database at borders    Police did not confirm the identity of the second individual arrested, but multiple reports have identified him as Hussam Eddin Alzahabi, 20. His father confirmed to the Canadian Press that Alzahabi was arrested on Thursday night. He was later released by police without charge. During the operation, police sealed off a neighbourhood in Kingston as they searched two houses. Video and photographs from the scene showed officers removing boxes of evidence from the properties. Trace elements of explosive material were found in one of the houses, said LeSage, and the two individuals were attempting to “manufacture an improvised explosive device”. Police declined to comment on any motive. As part of the operation, federal police flew a Pilatus PC-12 surveillance plane over Kingston for weeks. Residents in the city had previously complained about the mysterious buzzing noise in the sky. Numerous government agencies were involved in the operation, including the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) and Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada. “The government of Canada constantly monitors all potential threats and has robust measures in place to address them,” said the public safety minister, Ralph Goodale, in a statement. The country’s threat level, which has been at “medium” since 2014, remains unchanged."
161,terror,'This is where my everything is': US citizen suddenly faces deportation,"A New Yorker who gained US citizenship as a child is suddenly facing deportation, along with several green card-holding members of his family, after apparent targeting by the Trump administration in what the family believes is a clear case of anti-Muslim bias. None of the individuals have a criminal record, and say the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) only raised questions about the validity of their immigration status after another relative was arrested following a terrorist incident in the city. The government’s actions have alarmed advocates and led to them accusing officials of meting out unfair “collective punishment”. Ahsan Ullah, 32, an electrician from Brooklyn, was placed in immigration detention in Kearny, New Jersey, on 22 October. He spent about four weeks separated from his American wife and three children before being released on bond last Tuesday pending the outcome of his case. Four of his relatives, who all hold green cards, are also fighting government efforts to strip them of their US residency status. Since Trump came into office, the number of such denaturalization and citizenship revocation cases filed by DHS has surged.     Sherin and Ahsan Ullah. Photograph: Courtesy family    “Citizenship is permanently conditional for many people who were not born here,” said Fahd Ahmed, executive director of the advocacy group Desis Rising Up and Moving (Drum), which has been providing support to the Ullah family. “At a time when we are seeing a white nationalist current in government and society that wants to depopulate communities of color from this country, these cases are an indication of how their tactics and attacks are evolving.” Ahsan was born in Bangladesh and adopted by his uncle at a young age, the family said. After the uncle won a US visa through the diversity lottery program, Ahsan was granted a green card. He migrated to the US at eight years old and became a citizen several years later. Meanwhile, his uncle successfully petitioned to bring his sister, Ahsan’s biological mother and four siblings to the country as permanent residents in 2011. The family assumed their future in the US was secure. They focused on going to school, building careers and starting families. Ahsan became an electrician, got married and had three children. But everything changed in December 2017, when one of Ahsan’s brothers, Akayed, was arrested for detonating a homemade pipe bomb in a crowded New York City subway station. He was the only person injured, in what was seen as a botched attack. Family members both in the US and Bangladesh were questioned and none was found to have assisted the 27-year-old or to be supportive of terrorist organizations. Akayed was convicted of several terrorism offenses in 2018 and will be sentenced in February. Sherin, Ahsan’s wife, 30, said that the day Akayed was arrested the rest of the family was utterly shocked to learn what he had done. “For at least three, four months we were in disbelief,” she said. “We didn’t think [Akayed] was capable of this.” From the moment of Akayed’s arrest, other family members say that despite being cleared by law enforcement, they began to see consequences. Ahsan recounted receiving a letter from the bank notifying him that his personal and business banking accounts would be closed, and that the FBI put his business license on hold. Wary clients cancelled their contracts, he said. His mother and siblings would see New York police department squad cars parked regularly near their building and other places they frequented, including their mosque, which they had never remembered seeing before. Then, in April 2019, Ahsan received a letter out of the blue from US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), part of the DHS, stating that the agency planned to cancel his US citizenship on the grounds it was not lawfully obtained. In a panic, his mother and siblings applied for citizenship but soon received news that not only had their application been denied but that the DHS intended to revoke their green cards. On 6 November, Ullah’s mother and one of his sisters were detained for two days. “After all this time, we [had] mentally and physically bonded with this country, and love this country so much,” said Ayfa, Ahsan’s 22-year-old sister, the day she was released from detention. “How can you disown a person just like that?” The family is now trying to fight the agency’s orders. In paperwork issued to the family, which was reviewed by the Guardian, the DHS claims that Ahsan, his mother and siblings have no legal or biological relationship to the uncle whose original success in the green card lottery facilitated the others’ settling in the US. Lawyers for the family said they are gathering the paperwork to prove their relationships. The family and their advocates said the treatment amounts to collective punishment. “This is retribution for sharing the same DNA” as someone accused of terrorism, Ahsan said in a phone call from the Hudson county correctional facility in New Jersey, just before his release from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention. “I’ve been here [in the US] since I was a kid – my school is here, my college is here, my family is here, my business is here, my friends are here, my career is here,” he said . “This is where my everything is.” DHS declined to comment on the family’s case.   fundraiser   What’s happening to the Ullah family is not an isolated case. A report by the Open Society Justice Initiative in September found that the Trump administration has filed three times more civil denaturalization cases, about 30 a year – stripping Americans of their citizenship – than the average annual number pursued under the eight preceding presidents. Nearly half of all persons targeted for denaturalization in 2017 and 2018 came from “special interest” countries, a label used to identify nations with presumed links to terrorism, including Bangladesh, the report said, which amounted to a policy of “collective suspicion”. Manar Waheed, senior legislative and advocacy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the data indicates that “the same communities that this administration has targeted over and over again” are being singled out. Ahsan said that while he was in detention, he missed the moment when his seven-month-old son said “Baba” for the first time. “I’m just surprised by all this,” Ahsan said, speaking from the detention facility before he was released on bond. “I pay my taxes, I’ve never done anything wrong, I try to be a model citizen, and I’m here [in detention].” The administration has threatened to deport the family members unless they can prove their relationships are what they have long claimed and had not been challenged by the authorities before. The family is hoping they can reverse the Trump administration action by submitting challenges to the USCIS appeals office, contesting their deportation orders in immigration court and, if necessary, filing civil motions in federal court. But they are dismayed by the turn of events, and very nervous. Sherin said: “You can play everything by the book and they’ll still get you.”"
162,terror,Letter in Utrecht getaway car may suggest terror motive,"Dutch prosecutors have said they are still considering a possible terrorist motive for Monday’s shooting in Utrecht, and have so far uncovered no link between the main suspect and the three people who were killed. The regional public prosecutor’s office said in a statement that the investigators’ view was based on the nature of the shooting on Monday, which took place on a tram, and on a letter found in the getaway car. “Other motives cannot be excluded and are still being investigated,” the statement said, adding that a firearm had been recovered and several buildings in Utrecht had been searched. “At this point a terrorist motive is still being taken seriously.” The suspected gunman, Gökmen Tanis, 37, was detained on a street in the north of the city several hours after the 10.45am shooting at the central 24 Oktoberplein junction. Turkish-born Tanis had served several short prison terms for a variety of offences including – most recently – rape and been conditionally released from jail only on 1 March, Dutch court authorities confirmed to local media on Tuesday. He had then appeared in court on 4 March and been sentenced to two further terms, for robbery and theft. Interviewed by the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper, the woman he was convicted of raping said she had since warned police of his behaviour, describing him as “a psychopath”. The prosecutors’ statement said three people were seriously wounded in Monday’s shooting and four more sustained light injuries. It identified the dead as a 19-year-old woman from nearby Vianen and two men, aged 28 and 49, from Utrecht. Separately, Dutch police said two other people, reportedly brothers, had been arrested on suspicion of involvement in the shooting. Authorities initially declared the incident a possible terrorist attack before suggesting there may be other reasons, including a family or relationship dispute.  Several witnesses told Dutch media the shooting did not resemble a terror attack because the gunman had seemed to target one woman on the tram, and then fired at those who tried to help her. Utrecht, the Netherlands’ fourth largest city, was locked down for much of Monday as authorities asked residents to stay at home. Students were prevented from leaving schools and colleges, and many shops in the area closed. Ties Kortmann, a spokesman for the prosecutor’s office, confirmed on Tuesday that Tanis was being held on suspicion of manslaughter with a possible terrorist motive. There were initial reports of shootings in other areas of the city on Monday but these were later discounted by police. Police said a red Renault Clio was stolen near the Oktoberplein shortly before the attack, and was later found abandoned with a note, the contents of which have not been released. Members of the public and Utrecht’s mayor placed bunches of flowers near the busy junction where the shooting took place. One bunch carried a message in Dutch saying: “We are sad and deeply shaken. Utrecht has been hit hard; straight through the heart. Strength!! Peace and Love.”"
163,terror,Red poppy to be used to remember civilian victims for first time,"If you wear a red poppy this year, it will mean something different. The Royal British Legion has said that the symbol that has long represented remembrance of the UK’s armed forces will also stand for civilian victims, not just of war, but terrorism too. The position taken by the 98-year old charity, which distributes 40m red poppies a year, opens up the official meaning of the famous symbol to encapsulate the memory of victims of the Manchester Arena attack in 2017, as well as civilians in Nazi Germany in the second world war. Previously its “what is remembrance” web page said “the red poppy as a symbol relates to the armed forces community specifically, but not exclusively, and acknowledges the wider impact of conflict”. It has been changed to say it “remembers” the sacrifice of the British and Commonwealth armed forces, “pays tribute” to families and the emergency services, and says “we acknowledge innocent civilians who have lost their lives in conflict and acts of terrorism”. The Legion did not make a public announcement which reflects the sensitivity of the issue for a charity that last year raised £50m for veterans of British forces and their families through the sale of red poppies and associated items. The charity confirmed on Tuesday that it had adapted its position ahead of the launch of its annual poppy appeal next week. A spokesperson highlighted shifting public opinion about what remembrance should mean, particularly after the spate of terrorist attacks in the UK in 2017. “Our core positioning hasn’t changed but we do want to make it more explicit in our language, because remembrance is inclusive of all modern Britain and its important communities know their views and values are reflected in our activity,” the Legion’s assistant director of remembrance, Robert Lee told the Guardian. “Remembrance has a wider meaning and role, and this does include all civilians affected by conflict and terrorism. Remembrance paves the way for reconciliation, but it is up to each generation to find reconciliation for themselves, and the Legion upholds its place bringing people and communities together to have these important conversations.” The wording appears to chime with public opinion, as revealed in a survey of 2,094 members of the public last week ahead of the launch of the Peace Pledge Union’s white poppies, a pacifist symbol. The PPU campaigns for the remembrance of all victims of war. The poll by Populus for the PPU found 86% of people agreed that “all people who have died in war, including civilians should be remembered on Remembrance Sunday”. It also found that Remembrance Sunday should also involve remembering people of all nationalities who have died in war. “We have now seen that the majority of the public when asked about messages behind remembrance agree with the messages behind the white poppy, even if white poppies are not mentioned,” said Symon Hill, a spokesman for the PPU. The Legion’s move is likely to open a new chapter in an ongoing culture war about the meaning of poppies. In 2017, Col Richard Kemp, who led British forces in Iraq, attacked the sale of white poppies in schools as “indoctrinating children with a leftwing political agenda”. Meanwhile in 2013, the second world war veteran Harry Leslie Smith declared he would no longer wear a red poppy because he would not allow his “obligation as a veteran to remember those who died in the great wars to be coopted by … politicians to justify our folly in Iraq, our morally dubious war on terror and our elimination of one’s right to privacy”. The Soldiers’ Charity, which supports veterans and their families, welcomed the Legion’s move as “an addition to, not a dilution of” the remembrance of armed forces. “It’s a modern reflection of the cost of conflict,” said Dave Roberts, a spokesman, who said the introduction of terrorism victims was “sadly a reflection of the times we now live in”. “I come from an air force family and knew people who were in Bomber Command [which carried out devastating air raids across Germany] and the innocent victims of war are absolutely something they would want to look back and reflect on.”"
164,terror,To believe there’ll be world war three is to swallow US propaganda,"Afew weeks after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, several new Sudanese students appeared at my school in Khartoum. Halfway through the term they arrived, bewildered and dressed in what were clearly swiftly and randomly put-together clothes – shoes a size too big, dresses a size too small. For the first few days they mostly sat quietly in class, unable to adjust to the new academic material and seemingly not interested in making friends. One child spent her entire first week at the back of the class looking vacantly out of the window at the school gardens, tears silently streaming down her face. Slowly they began to open up and tell us who they were. These were Saddam’s refugees: the children of Sudanese expats working in Kuwait, who had grabbed what they could and fled the country. We clustered around them as they told us the stories of the invasion – stories that have since become woven into the popular mythology of Saddam’s brutality. One harrowing detail they repeated was that Iraqi troops entered a hospital and ripped baby incubators from their electric sockets. They all refused to countenance the possibility that they might never return. It was confusing, then, that when Operation Desert Storm – the military campaign by the United States and its allies to reclaim Kuwait from Saddam – began in January 1991, the majority of these children were fiercely opposed to it. One angry girl, who had lost weight rapidly through anxiety since she’d arrived, stood on a desk and shouted, “It’s going to get more messy! The whole world is going to get more messy!” It is now three decades since that moment, and after the assassination of Iran’s military chief Qassem Suleimani last week, this child’s words echo. Her intuition cut through all the legal, political and moral questions. All that mattered to her was that, ultimately, more people would suffer and the situation would become impossible to contain. And those people who would suffer most would be her own, not the well-armed and well-armoured liberating forces. It’s always a difficult balance to strike, between happiness that a cynical tyrant such as Saddam or Suleimani is eliminated, and the fear that the intervention could save lives in the short-term, only to ultimately accelerate instability. In real terms this instability means more bloodshed, more refugees, more children whose lives change for ever overnight.    The victims will be America’s Arab proxies, be they nations such as Saudi Arabia and its allies, or military factions    To state that such interventions are dangerous is not a detachment born of an anti foreign-intervention principle. Happy at the death of a menace but “nervous” and “scared” is how some I spoke to in the region summarised their reaction to Suleimani’s killing. Away from the western analysts’ discussions of how this assassination will affect the re-election or impeachment of President Trump, or from the moral question of whether manhunting is a legitimate tool of foreign policy, life has become even more treacherous for millions in the Middle East. Suleimani has brought pain and suffering to the region by running proxy wars, smothering revolutions, and extending lifelines to tyrants such as Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, who otherwise would have been rightly toppled. But his killing will have asymmetric results – American lives will go on as usual, while the Middle East will be destabilised even further. The problem with engaging in war by assassination in the region is that the effort never goes all the way to ending the fighting. The problem is not foreign intervention in itself but the way America goes about foreign intervention. Striking and withdrawing, removing heads of government or other perceived enemy chiefs then packing up tools and leaving (or in drone warfare, turning off a screen and going home), achieves little – no fundamental resolution. Suleimani’s killing may solve a temporary problem, real or confected for White House PR purposes, but the blowback will not be felt by those who are making “world war three” trend on social media. It will not be a new world war – that kind of talk only shows how effective the American propaganda machine has been in manufacturing the impression that there is an annihilating threat from Tehran. Suleimani’s killing has been justified as a defensive measure against possible attacks on US embassies, consulates and military in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. The plotting was “clear and unambiguous” according to General Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. But a US official told the New York Times that the “new” intelligence merely pointed to “a normal Monday in the Middle East”. Does any of this sound familiar? Unquestionable intelligence that an imminent strike against western lives requires immediate and dramatic scrambling? The ruses for the calamitous 2003 invasion of Iraq have not been updated, merely recycled. Hundreds of thousands of deaths later and, just to drive home the unlearned lesson even more, after a post-invasion quagmire that gifted Iran and Suleimani power and influence in the country, we are at the same place. Except this time it seems no one went to the effort of sexing up a dossier or coming up with a “WMD ready within 45 minutes” excuse for an attack.   Related: Doubts grow over US case for Suleimani assassination as Iran urges revenge    What will happen instead of world war three is an escalation in which Iran, without the ability to retaliate on US soil, will seek to reassert its dominance in the region. The victims will be America’s Arab proxies, be they nations such as Saudi Arabia and its allies, or military factions. An evacuation of US expats is already under way in Iraq. But citizens of Iraq, and of the nations within the larger regional war zone, have no such option, no refuge from collateral damage. For them, as the young girl said three decades ago, the world has just become more messy. • Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist"
165,terror,'You were a pawn': London Bridge hero's message to attacker,"Ten days after the London bridge attack, Darryn Frost wrote a heartfelt message to Usman Khan to leave on the spot of their fatal struggle. He also wrote cards to Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt and placed them on the bridge. They were prayerful offerings and it was a way of processing the trauma, but he had second thoughts about leaving his note to Khan, partly fearing public disapproval of any attempt to forgive the terrorist. He has given the Guardian permission to reproduce it here. “Usman Khan,” he began. “I have written this card upside down, to reflect my world now. You got what you wanted, now you and others are dead. They had no choice. You stole that from them. Jack showed you love and care which many think you did not deserve. This shows Jack’s belief in humanity. You stopped attacking and spoke to me, so you’ll remember who I am. Then on the bridge I stabbed you with the tusk. But as I restrained your arms you will have heard me shouting out to those who started to hit you. I shouted at them to stop and I shifted my body to protect your head and the punching stopped.” He continued: “Then I tried to save your life by restraining your hands to reduce the threat and prevent you from being shot. If only your community who turned you towards hate had shown you some of this care instead. You were used. Those who turned you still live and breathe today. You were just their pawn. Perhaps we can somehow turn your misguided and evil actions to promote love, kindness and compassion.” “Finally,” he wrote, “I leave you a rose from me, which I hang upside down as I try to be as compassionate as Saskia and Jack were, but realise that I still have some way to go. This world needs a balanced view, one free of fear. I will do all I can to extinguish hate, just like I did on that bridge with the others. I will show you, and hopefully the world, the power of love.”"
166,terror,Sports Personality of the Year: a show so dull it gives me nightmares,"One of my recurring nightmares – sweat, knotted sheets, the frantic sensation of a bedroom at rest suddenly illuminated by the slash of the big light – is that I have to go for a pint with Michael Owen, former Sports Personality of the Year (Sunday, 7pm, BBC One). In 1998, Owen was rated Britain’s top sports personality, despite (even at his then-tender age of 19), having the unerring energy of someone whose favourite Sunday activity was opening all the doors out and hoovering his car. “I’ve got a little jet wash thing,” Michael Owen is telling me, while he sips a tankard of bitter that he left to warm up to room temperature before he drank it, and I say: “Uh huh.” “It’s got a little nozzle on it. Great pressure.” That must be good for getting in the grooves of the tyres, I say. “It is, yeah. Muddy up round us.” We fall into a lull of silence. “Got it on offer, too…” Michael Owen trails off. Do you ever, I ask, use that on the driveway? Michael Owen thinks for a moment. “No.” The nightmare always ends the same way: the rising swell of noise, of fruit machines and people eating peanuts and children playing, distantly, in the pub garden behind us; chattering laughter at the bar, the turn of Sunday newspapers, the ding of the kitchen bell, and Michael Owen’s small eyes, staring at me in silence. And then he opens his mouth to speak.              “Do you mind,” Michael Owen will say. “Do you mind if Kelly Holmes, Jonny Wilkinson, Zara Phillips and Lewis Hamilton join us?” And then I’m back in the world again, palpitating, panting, screaming, and a quiet voice shushes from behind me. “The Michael Owen dream again?” the voice asks, and through the tears I nod. “Mark Cavendish can’t hurt you, Joel. Tony McCoy can’t hurt you. Chris Hoy’s massive thighs can’t hurt you.” It is Sports Personality of the Year again this week, an awards show that I modestly propose should actually be renamed Hey: Remember Sports? Because that’s all SPotY is: Gary Lineker, in a tuxedo, remembering sports; highly produced Coldplay-soundtracked soaring sports memories from the year that came before it; the audience of people – also in tuxedos, also remembering sports – clapping at every memory of sports; and occasionally Gabby Logan coming in, yelling, “Remember sports?”, and everyone saying: “Yes, Gabby, we remember sports.” At the end of the evening, a trophy is awarded to the person whose sport we remember most, which this year will be almost certainly be Ben Stokes. The whole programme runs over and threatens to bump forward into the news, so he has to say thank you really quickly. “Sport can be… so much, for so many people,” Ben Stokes will say. “Remember: sports.” And I retreat, to bed, praying that Michael Owen doesn’t visit me again in my slumber, asking what my favourite Castrol oil is (“GTX or Edge, Joel? This shouldn’t be that difficult!”), or whether I read the latest Tesco Magazine. “The voucher offers,” Michael Owen will say. “The voucher offers are unparalleled. If you don’t claim them, you’re just leaving money on the table.” He takes another sip of bitter. “You’re just leaving money on the table.”"
167,terror,London Bridge: Boris Johnson thrusts attack into centre of election battle,"Boris Johnson on Saturday said that those convicted of the most serious terrorist offences should never be released from prison, as arguments over the blame for Friday’s London Bridge attack were thrust centre stage into the election campaign. The prime minister reacted to the latest terrorist incident – in which three people died, including the assailant – by promising a package of hardline reforms which also included mandatory minimum 14-year sentences, an end to automatic early release for terrorist and extremism offences, and a new system under which those convicted will have to serve every day of sentences handed down by judges. At the same time, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the London mayor Sadiq Khan said urgent questions had to be asked about the Tory government’s record of imposing draconian austerity cuts to the prison services, while attempting a botched probation privatisation and failing to run an effective sentencing system. On Saturday further details emerged about the knifeman, Usman Khan, and how he was subdued with a fire extinguisher and a narwhal tusk on London Bridge.  The convicted terrorist, who had been fitted with an electronic tag to track his movements after release from prison on licence last December, had been attending a prisoner rehabilitation conference at Fishmongers’ Hall. After threatening to blow up the building, he stabbed five people then moved to London Bridge where he was confronted by members of the public. One sprayed him with a fire extinguisher, while another pointed a 2m narwhal tusk taken from Fishmongers’ Hall by a Polish chef named Łukasz. Khan was tackled from behind and pinned down. Among those grappling with him were ex-prisoners attending the conference including James Ford, a convicted murderer. Sources told the Observer that Khan attended a Whitehall conference earlier this year under escort. But he went to Friday’s conference unsupervised following discussions between police and probation officers. The Ministry of Justice said on Saturday it was conducting a review of licence conditions of some 70 terrorists released under licence since 2000. Last night Islamic State claimed responsibility but offered no evidence to support the claim.

Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters    The first victim of the attack was named as 25-year-old Jack Merritt, a Cambridge University postgraduate and course coordinator for the Learning Together rehabilitation programme at Fishmongers’ Hall. Hours ahead of Johnson announcing his hardline changes to sentencing, Jack’s father, David Merritt, posted a Twitter appeal urging politicians not to use his son’s death as a pretext for severe action. “My son Jack would not wish his death to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences or for detaining people unnecessarily,” he wrote. On Sunday Corbyn will blame successive leaders, including Tony Blair, for stoking hatred with disastrous foreign interventions. While insisting that terrorists, their funders and recruiters are mainly to blame, he will add: “Sixteen years ago, I warned against the invasion and occupation of Iraq. I said it would set off a spiral of conflict, hate, misery, desperation that will fuel the wars, the conflict, the terrorism, and the misery of future generations. “It did, and we are still living with the consequences today.” Early signs that the attack was becoming politicised with less than two weeks to go before the 12 December election came when the home secretary, Priti Patel, clashed with Labour’s Yvette Cooper on Twitter. Cooper had questioned how Khan could have been released given he was “thought to be so dangerous”. “Instead he was released 6 yrs later without Parole Board assessment. How cd this be allowed to happen?” asked Cooper. Patel responded by blaming Labour: “Because legislation brought in by your government in 2008 meant that dangerous terrorists had to automatically be released after half of their jail term.” In a statement on Saturday, Johnson said : “It’s absolutely clear that we can’t carry on with the failed approaches of the past.” Appearing in part to blame his predecessors, Theresa May and David Cameron, he said: “We simply cannot risk being in the same situation for the next five years where parliament cannot do what’s needed. We need a government that can act. The terrorist who attacked yesterday was sentenced 11 years ago under laws passed in 2008 which established automatic early release. “This system has got to end – I repeat, this has got to end, as I‘ve been saying for four months. If you are convicted of a serious terrorist offence, there should be a mandatory minimum sentence of 14 years – and some should never be released. “Further, for all terrorism and extremist offences the sentence announced by the judge must be the time actually served – these criminals must serve every day of their sentence, with no exceptions.” Corbyn said the attack was a disaster which reflected failings at multiple levels. “There’s got to be a very full investigation and clearly there’s been a complete disaster. I think there is also a question about what the probation service were doing – were they involved at all – and whether the parole board should have been involved in deciding whether or not he should have been allowed to be released from prison in the first place. “And also, what happened in prison, that somebody who was clearly a danger to society, was he given a de-radicalisation programme or not? We need to all know the answer to those questions urgently. Brendan Cox, husband of the murdered MP Jo Cox, and a member of the campaign group Survivors Against Terror, called on all politicians to resist using the tragedy as a pretext for political point-scoring: “We don’t want terrorists changing the course of our election and we definitely don’t want politicians of any party using it for party advantage. By all means debate the right policy response but please don’t use it to score cheap political points.” Met commissioner Cressida Dick praised the public for their response to Khan’s rampage. Visiting the scene, she said that she was “very proud to be a Londoner”."
168,terror,'Frozen in time' wreck sheds new light on Franklin's ill-fated 1845 Arctic quest,"Evidence recovered from beneath the bitter cold of Canada’s Arctic Ocean will shed new light on the final days the ill-fated expedition of the British polar explorer Sir John Franklin, who disappeared with his crew in 1845.   Related: Ship found in Arctic 168 years after doomed Northwest Passage attempt    Parks Canada and Inuit researchers announced on Wednesday the results of a study of the HMS Terror – including “groundbreaking” new images from within the incredibly well-preserved ship – and raised the possibility that logs and maps have remained intact and legible after nearly 170 years underwater. Over several weeks in early August, the researchers launched 3D-mapping technology to survey the wreck site off the the coast of King William Island in Nunavut. For the first time ever, the team was also able to make seven trips inside the ship by piloting a remotely operated vehicle through the ship. Nearly 90% of the ship’s lower deck – including the areas where the crew ate and slept – were accessible to the vehicle. In total, the expedition was able to study 20 separate rooms. “The impression we witnessed when exploring the HMS Terror is of a ship only recently deserted by its crew, seemingly forgotten by the passage of time,” said Ryan Harris, a senior archeologist for Parks Canada, in a statement.              In 1845, the HMS Erebus and HMS Terror departed England in search of the coveted Northwest Passage. But the famed and closely watched expedition ended in disaster, with all 129 crew members succumbing to the hostile elements of the Arctic. Recent excavations on nearby islands suggest a combination of scurvy, hypothermia – and potentially cannibalism – killed the crew after they abandoned the two stranded vessels. Multiple expeditions to recover the ships and the remains of the crew proved futile. For generations, Inuit oral history has told of the two wrecked ships and stranded sailors. Long ignored by western archaeologists, the history was vindicated when Inuit historians helped uncover the final resting sites of the Erebus in 2014, and the Terror in 2016.     Plates and other artifacts sit on shelves next to a mess table where lower-ranking crew members would have taken their meals on HMS Terror, in Terror Bay, off King William Island, Nunavut. Photograph: Ryan Harris/AFP/Getty Images    Since the monumental discovery, Parks Canada has set about studying both ships in detail, with the aim of better understanding the lives of those aboard – and the final months of the voyage. From within the wreck, Capt Francis Crozier’s cabin remains the most intact. Only his sleeping quarters, which are behind a shut door, are inaccessible. The location itself, beneath the frigid Arctic waters, has been critical to preserving much of the ship. The water temperature, and lack of natural light, has prevented the degradation many of the items, including crockery and and navigation too. Most exciting for the researchers is the prospect that thick sediment, low in oxygen, has preserved documentation within the ship, including logbooks and maps. “Not only are the furniture and cabinets in place, drawers are closed and many are buried in silt, encapsulating objects and documents in the best possible conditions for their survival,” said Marc-André Bernier, the head of Parks Canada’s underwater archaeology department, in a statement. “Each drawer and other enclosed space will be a treasure trove of unprecedented information on the fate of the Franklin Expedition.”     Bottles and other artifacts sit on a shelf in a cabin on the lower deck of HMS Terror. Photograph: Ryan Harris/AFP/Getty Images    Any items retrieved from the expedition will be shared between the governments of Canada and Inuit, the result of a recent agreement between the two groups. Before publicly announcing the most recent discovered, community members of Gjoa Haven, including young students, were the first to view images of the wreck. Parks Canada plans has set up devices to monitor the flow of the water nearby to the Terror, and is now studying the Erebus. The team hopes their survey of the site until early September before the annual formation of autumn sea ice."

Soldiers forced the organisation to stop its work in the region on 18 September.

Action Against Hunger has called on the Nigerian authorities to allow its work in the region to continue. The organisation said it received “no prior notice or explanation for this action” and had been forced to stop assistance to “millions of people in Maiduguri, Monguno and Damasak with immediate effect”, affecting “the most vulnerable people in the region”.   Related: Nigeria detained children as young as five over 'Boko Haram links' – report    Militants have operated in north-eastern Nigeria and the Lake Chad region for the past decade, displacing more than 2 million people.

In July, a female Action Against Hunger staff member was abducted together with drivers and health workers from a humanitarian programme run by the organisation in Damasak region of Borno state."
170,terror,Boris Johnson ignores call to stop politicising London Bridge attack,"Boris Johnson has refused to acknowledge a heartfelt call from David Merritt to stop politicising the death of his son, Jack, in the London Bridge terror attack last week. On the campaign trail in Salisbury, the prime minister was confronted with the words of Merritt, who said that Jack would have been “seething that his death was being used to perpetuate an agenda of hate that he gave his everything fighting against”.   Related: 'Jack would be livid his death has been used to further an agenda of hate' | Dave Merritt    But Johnson ignored Merritt’s message and reiterated his insistence that tougher sentencing was the answer to dealing with the threat of terrorists reoffending. Asked whether he accepted Merritt’s calls for the politicisation to stop, he said: “I’ve campaigned for tougher sentencing for a long time. It was in my manifesto when I stood to be mayor of London in 2012 and I said in August it was a mistake to have automatic release of serious and violent offenders. As you know, there is a bill waiting to go in the Queen’s speech to implement that. “One of the frustrations that I had about this parliament and the lack of a working Conservative majority is that we were unable to progress that. I do think, I’m afraid, that automatic early release for prisoners of this kind is not the right thing for this country.” The prime minister’s repeated calls for tougher sentencing since the attack on Friday in London have drawn condemnation from opposition parties, who said it was distasteful to exploit the event to promote his policies and to seek to pin the blame on Labour. In an earlier interview with Sky News, Johnson claimed there were “some people who cannot be rehabilitated” and argued that in the case of the attacker, Usman Khan, it would have been “better for the protection of the society and us all to keep him in than run the risk of letting him out”. Merritt, in an article for the Guardian on Monday, said Jack had campaigned against locking people up and “throwing away the key”. Merritt wrote: “If Jack could comment on his death – and the tragic incident on Friday 29 November – he would be livid. We would see him ticking it over in his mind before a word was uttered between us. Jack would understand the political timing with visceral clarity. “He would be seething at his death, and his life, being used to perpetuate an agenda of hate that he gave his everything fighting against. We should never forget that.” Johnson has been emphasising his security policies this week but advisers claim this was long planned because of the Nato leaders’ meeting taking place on Wednesday. Ahead of the meeting, he is due to announce that public venues will be compelled to ramp up security against the threat of terrorism. The move is a response to a campaign from the family of Martyn Hett, a victim of the 2017 Manchester attack, who have been pushing for venues to be better prepared for evacuation of their premises. The Conservatives said they would, if elected, “require venues to assess the threat of a terrorist attack and take steps to prepare as part of their health and safety strategy”. Johnson said: “The nature of threats faced by British citizens has changed in the evolution of modern extremism. It is no longer sufficient for public venues to prepare for accidental threats like fire. They need to reduce their vulnerability to people who seek to perpetrate violent acts too … there are steps we can and will take to make public spaces as secure as possible.”"
171,terror,Police reassess terror warning signs as hunt for accomplices goes on,"All day people were coming in and out of the house with the pale-pink walls, and neighbours were becoming suspicious. An elder in the village of the eastern Sri Lankan city of Kalmunai was summoned to confront the men who had rented the property a few weeks before. The discussion soon became tense, and a tall, well-built man whom the elder did not recognise walked out of the house carrying an automatic weapon. “You have no business being here,” he said, according to the elder, firing a few rounds into the air and sending neighbours fleeing. By the early hours of Saturday, 15 people were dead, including three children, and the walls of the house were blackened by the force of three explosions from the suicide bombers who had been cornered inside. Reuters reported on Saturday that a woman and child injured in the fighting were the wife and daughter of Mohammed Zahran Hashim, the extremist preacher identified as the leader of the terrorist cell responsible for killing at least 253 people in a string of bombings of churches and luxury hotels. Police sources said the woman was in a serious condition.   Graphic: map of Sri Lanka   The 90-minute gun battle in the city, about seven hours’ drive from the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, is part of an ongoing hunt for accomplices and sympathisers of the suicide bombers that has led to dozens of arrests and controlled explosions of suspicious vehicles and packages. Sri Lankan leaders have estimated there are at least 70 people still at large, “some capable of exploding themselves”, the country’s prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, told the Observer. Both the US and India stepped up their travel warnings for nationals seeking to visit Sri Lanka on Saturday. The house in Kalmunai had been rented by a man claiming to be a telecommunications engineer, the landlord, who asked not to be named, said. He had paid cash, but unusually, had not asked for a discount for doing so. Money had not appeared to be a problem. On Friday night a civilian was killed in the crossfire between police and the men inside and at least three others were injured, police said.    Related: Sri Lanka bombings: everything we know so far    On Saturday afternoon, a video started to be shared on Islamic State’s online channels purporting to show three men inside the house. “Those who try to destroy us will be a taught a lesson,” says one man, who appears to have just one eye and several mangled fingers. Children can be heard in the background. The next man speaks holding a rifle in one hand and his toddler son in the other. “Those who wish to do us harm are surround us now,” he says. “Even if we are destroyed this movement will not be stopped.” It is not clear when the video was shot and its authenticity has not been verified. Since Sunday’s attack by the radical network, led by Hashim, a previously obscure radical preacher, police are re-examining a series of incidents that they now view as possible red flags that militants in the country were becoming more violent and brazen. Authorities are now actively investigating whether the murder of two policemen last year at a remote police checkpoint in Vavunathivu, a town in the eastern district of Batticaloa, was also committed by members of the network, sources inside the investigation revealed on Saturday. A gun thought to belong to one of the murdered officers was found inside the house that was raided in Kalmunai on Friday night, sources said. At the time, the murder was suspected to be the work of remnants of the Tamil Tigers.  The vandalism of four Buddhist statues in Mawanella, a central town, about a month after the shooting of the officers is also being seen a crucial change in tactics: the first time men linked to Hashim turned their ire on people of another faith, after years of harassing other Muslims. “This may have been a tryout,” Wickremesinghe said. “We know that before the Buddhist images there were attacks on Sufi mosques. So they appeared to be going step by step. First their own Muslims, then the Buddhists, and there was something in a small church near Kandy, information that they wanted to damage the church.”     Sri Lankan security personnel search a vehicle in Colombo. Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images    Authorities received multiple warnings about Zahran from Muslim community leaders and specific intelligence in the weeks, days and possibly hours before the 21 April attacks that the extremist was planning to target churches. Why those warnings were ignored has been the subject of recriminations this week inside Sri Lanka’s bitterly divided government. “There was a communications breakdown because nothing was being shared with me and the prime minister,” said Ruwan Wijewardene, Sri Lanka’s defence minister, who had been excluded from security council meetings since a constitutional crisis cleaved the government into factions last October. The country’s president, Maithripala Sirisena, who chairs the security council meetings, says he was never told of the threat either. Blame has fallen on the country’s top defence bureaucrat, Hemasiri Fernando, and the chief inspector of police Pujith Jayasundara. Fernando quit on Thursday evening after submitting a defiant resignation letter. “I have disseminated the information I received and carried out my responsibility, however, certain officials and relevant departments have not acted accordingly, and as a result we had to face this terrible tragedy,” he wrote.     A Sri Lankan soldier stands guard on a street in Colombo. Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images    In past months, Sirisena has been deploying the resources of the country’s security apparatus towards a war on drugs inspired by the brutal campaign of the Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte. A vast network of military and intelligence officials are also spread out through the country’s north, keeping watch on Tamil civilians the embers of the Tamil Tigers militia. “Drugs have always been an issue to us, but we also had to be on our guard against terrorism, global terrorism,” Wickremesinghe said. “Some people were looking really at the re-emergence of the [Tigers] but I couldn’t see that.” Late on Saturday, Sirisena announced he was banning two groups allegedly linked to the Easter bombings under emergency powers that came into effect on Tuesday. His office said National Thawheed Jammath, or NTJ, and Jamathei Millathu Ibraheem, or JMI, would be banned by presidential decree. Presidential spokesman Dharmasri Ekanayake said the move allowed the government to confiscate any property belonging to the two organisations. The one-week mark since the devastating attack will be quietly honoured, with churches advised not to hold Sunday masses. A small service will be led by Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith in Colombo, and broadcast on national television. “His eminence [the cardinal] has advised us not to gather people in churches,” said a spokesman. “In place of that, his eminence is expecting the faithful to watch the mass in spirit.” Another service is scheduled to be held in a tent outside St Sebastian’s church in Negombo, where last week, a bomber with a backpack entered the middle of the church towards the end of the service, turned his back to the congregation, and detonated himself. More than 100 people were killed there."
172,terror,What could finally stir me to communism? Watching Made in Chelsea with my daughter,"I’ve been in Berlin this week for a few days with my younger daughter. I wanted to bring her to the city because she is studying the second world war for history A level, so there was half a chance I could get her into museums without a fight. Also, I’ve been reading Joseph Roth’s writings about Berlin between the wars. The collection is called What I Saw: Reports from Berlin 1920-33. Well, here are a few things I saw. First, I saw my daughter in the brilliant Topography of Terror museum, dedicated (if that’s the right word) to the SS and built on the site of the Gestapo secret police headquarters. What a young woman she must be to apply herself so assiduously to the astounding material in there and then repair to our lodgings and pay the same rapt attention to several episodes of Made in Chelsea on her laptop. Honestly, she must have done six on the trot. What a day we had. Perhaps because of my torment at involuntarily catching long snatches of Made In Chelsea, small communist leanings I didn’t know lay within me rose to the surface. On a sightseeing bus tour (I love those, but that’s another story) our guide pointed out a huge Coca-Cola logo structure atop some hulking, sulking building in the old East Berlin. This, we were told with some pride, was the first bit of proper western advertising to be visited upon the newly liberated east Germans. Coca-Cola? Honestly, is that the best the west could show them, an attractively packaged but incredibly sugary drink? Their joy must have been unbridled. If only they had known, too, that one day it would also be possible – without a knock on the door from the thought police – to lie in their beds watching absurdly privileged toffs talking tosh for hours on end."
173,terror,Emily Blunt: 'It's about human beings and how they're affected by a crisis',"Emily Blunt and her husband, John Krasinski, devised a rigorous self-care regime when the pair were making A Quiet Place, 2017’s harrowing self-isolation horror hit. “I always say that Macallan 12 sponsored A Quiet Place,” says Blunt. “John and I would just go home and drink a lot of whisky every night. And that sort of continued on A Quiet Place 2.” You, too, might need a tumbler of scotch while watching the film. Blunt describes it as a “runaway train that grips you by the neck”, which is half-right. It also takes that neck and lays it on the tracks before running over it repeatedly. “I realised what an investment people had in this family from the first film,” says Blunt. “Everyone asked: ‘What happens next?’” Now the answer is on the way. As if the audience had gone out for a two-year loo break, the new movie picks up at the very moment the first one ended — with Blunt’s wounded matriarch, Evelyn Abbott, and her three surviving children in the basement of their farm after fending off an alien attack. Try to imagine giving birth in such a nightmare landscape and you have the plot of A Quiet Place. Take the newborn out into the world, to face fresh dangers, and you have A Quiet Place Part 2. “At its core, it’s about motherhood, it’s about parenthood, it’s about how far you’d go to protect your children,” Blunt says. “It turns out you’d go a really long way.” Scotch is not being served in the New York hotel suite where we meet. Instead, there’s abstemious pots of earl grey and three sorry biscuits. Blunt contemplates a trio of jugs with a mix of curiosity and suspicion. “So many different milks here,” she says. “I think that’s the one I want. This is real milk, not fake,” she says approvingly, offering it over. “The idea of oat milk probably makes you feel a bit sick.” Blunt has a ready – and pleasing – facility to make you feel noticed. It’s easy to see why she was such tip-top casting for Mary Poppins, though her daughters, Hazel, five, and Violet, three, prefer the 1964 original. “They’ve seen mine once and that seemed to be enough for them,” says Blunt. “Whereas Julie Andrews has been watched on a loop.” Her acting self confuses them, she says. Her first priority coming back from work is to remove her makeup so they recognise her. Mary Poppins and A Quiet Place were released in 2018. In the former, she glides down into a picturesque London on the end of a parrot-handled brolly. In the latter, she gives birth alone, bloodied and terrorised, in a hell-blasted landscape. Both are about the promise parents make to their children to keep them safe; but in A Quiet Place, and its sequel, we see what happens when that promise can’t be kept.              “If the first movie is about parenthood, I think that the second one is very much about that idea of a fractured sense of community,” says Blunt. “It’s really diving into human beings and how they’re affected by a crisis, and who’s resilient enough to withstand this kind of thing and still extend your hand to your neighbour.” It may be unintentionally ironic, but at the time of writing, A Quiet Place 2’s release has been postponed as the coronavirus crisis takes hold. Covid-19 aside, the sense of a world in freefall was always “very intentional”, says Blunt. Krasinski, who wrote and directed the film as well as starring in it, “just felt this untethered feeling in the world, in which community and the idea of community is under threat, led by our fears, by our fears of people who are different from us, by our own need for survival”. The outsider this time round is one of the Abbotts’ neighbours, played by Cillian Murphy – himself a veteran at navigating post-apocalyptic landscapes. Murphy’s breakout, zombies-on-acid horror 28 Days Later hit cinemas in November 2002, just as Sars was exploding in southern China. In the early moments of A Quiet Place 2, we catch glimpses of news reports of mass casualties in Shanghai, a jarring reminder that today’s headlines often play like a movie despite real-world tragedy. “Everyone is walking around with a low level of anxiety about the state of the world, how we’re abusing it, and about the capacity of the people in charge,” Murphy tells me over the phone. “That’s why these films tap into people’s psyches and get under their skin.” Being a couple on screen has inevitably raised the profile of Blunt and Krasinski’s real marriage, but Blunt seems unwilling to play the celeb-couple game. When Graham Norton asked her in 2018 if she and Krasinski had a portmanteau like Brangelina or Bennifer, Blunt shot back: “Krunt.” She is not on social media, has no plans to be and ferociously guards the separation between her public and private lives. She and Krasinski named their first daughter Hazel after the Nick Drake song Hazey Jane, she says, but asked if she can recall the first time they listened to it, she replies – with a compensating smile – “I do and I’m not going to share it.” Living in Brooklyn helps. “No one bothers us, we walk around, we don’t have a car, it’s very manageable,” she says. “I don’t know many other neighbourhoods where we would find it as easy.”     As Mary Poppins. Photograph: Courtesy of Disney/AP    Hazey Jane off the table, Blunt does tell the story of introducing Krasinski to her parents over Sunday roast at their house. “My father likes to present the beef sort of barely cooked,” Blunt says, and then lowers her voice a few octaves to imitate her father requesting his steak be served “bleu”, his doner kebab rare. Anyway, Krasinski, true to his Boston upbringing, made not a murmur of protest. “It is my lasting memory of how John coped with that situation, as someone who prefers things a bit more medium.” Raised in Roehampton, London – not a million miles from the Reigate constituency of her uncle, the Tory MP Crispin Blunt – Blunt was privately educated and doesn’t mind saying her parents are properly posh. She studied recordings of Princess Margaret to nail Poppins’ clipped vowels; possibly a chat with her mother might have sufficed. The second of four children, Blunt says she was “the naughty one who wanted to go clubbing on holiday”. This was permitted only if her older sister, Felicity, went along too – which essentially kiboshed the plan. “She’d bring a suitcase of 10 books and read them all over two weeks,” Blunt recalls. Now a literary agent, Felicity keeps her sister’s bedside table stacked: Things in Jars by Jess Kidd is currently on top; below is Max Porter’s Lanny. “God, but it’s so good. Reading it was a visceral experience.” As a child, Blunt aspired to be a translator, but fell into acting as a handy way to manage a stutter. A student production in Edinburgh sealed the deal; next thing she knew she was starring alongside Judi Dench on stage. She arrived on screen in My Summer of Love, Pawel Pawlikowski’s gorgeous coming-of-age tale. In the 16 years since, Blunt has made 32 movies; not many shy of Kate Winslet, the actor whose career – and no-nonsense charm – Blunt’s most seems to resemble. “I’ve been lucky because the films that I built my whole career on, those $25m- to $35m-budget films like Sicario and The Devil Wears Prada, aren’t really being made any more,” she says. “It’s a shame because those films were really clever and beautifully crafted, and people ended up actually seeing them.” Her career has been marked by a succession of stretching new roles. “She doesn’t phone anything in,” says Tate Taylor, who directed her in The Girl on a Train. “You just lean into her when she’s on screen, and you have to possess that.”     With Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe in A Quiet Place 2. Photograph: Allstar/Paramount    Recently, Blunt wrote to Pawlikowski to thank him for “giving me instinctive tools. Working with him was so freewheeling and terrifying, because there was no script and it was improvised, so it’s a weird feeling of jumping off a cliff every day. All you had was instinct.” Blunt does a good impression of Pawlikowski scoffing at “Hollywood bullshit”, but the director’s scepticism found its mark. Working with him, she says, has “always encouraged me to stretch a scene around and to question it, and make sure you find the most interesting way in”. Next, Blunt starts work on her first TV project proper: The English, a BBC western by Hugo Blick, the man behind The Honourable Woman. She won’t give details, save that she signed on immediately. “I literally called my husband and said: ‘I just read one page of a script and I’m doing it.’” Actually, she has done some TV before: bit parts in Foyle’s War and Poirot and, four years ago, a turn on Saturday Night Live. “I’ve never been more scared in my life,” she shudders. “I get anxiety just thinking about it. The whole week was such a whirlwind because Violet was nine weeks old so I just wasn’t sleeping.” There’s a reason there’s a vomit bucket just offstage, she says. “I mean, I didn’t puke in it, but it’s there. It was just this completely alternate reality. This amazing woman who has looked after the talent going in there to host it for years just wrestled me around the sets and stripped my clothes off. I mean tearing the clothes off me. I remember her standing by that door and they’re like: ‘Live from New York!’ and she’s rubbing my back very firmly and I’m moving with it, and she goes: ‘You’re OK, you’re all right, you’re OK, breathe, you’re OK, OK, you’re up.’ Honestly, it’s like a nightmare. The thought of it now, it makes me sweat.” And a Quiet Place 3 just got its plot. A Quiet Place 2 will be released later this year •&nbsp;This article was amended on 13 March 2020 because Nick Drake’s song Hazey Jane, was misnamed Hazy Jane. This has been corrected."
174,terror,Two Australians confirmed dead in Sri Lanka Easter Sunday terror attacks,"Two Australians were among at least 290 people killed in a series of terror attacks at churches and hotels throughout Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday. Confirming the news at a news conference on Monday afternoon, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the two Australians were members of the same family and had been living in Sri Lanka. “Out of respect for the family I can’t provide any further details about those two individuals, other than to say we deeply regret these deaths and we extend our deepest and most sincere sympathies to the family,” Morrison said.   Related: Sri Lanka bombings: 24 arrested in wake of terror attack, police say – live    Two other Australians – a woman in her mid-50s and a woman in her mid to late 20s – were also injured but are now in a stable condition. “One was treated for shrapnel wounds and the other has been treated for a broken leg,” Morrison said. “We understand they are both receiving consular support and that’s the extent of the information that I have.” Morrison said one of the deceased, and both injured women, were dual nationals. Three churches and four hotels were hit by the co-ordinated explosions, which mostly targeted the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo. Sri Lankan authorities have now arrested 24 people, but while the country’s defence minister, Ruwan Wijewardene, has blamed religious extremists, no group has yet claimed responsibility. Wijewardene said suicide bombers were responsible for the majority of the bombings. The death toll currently stands at 290 but is expected to rise, with at least 500 injured. Most of the dead are understood to be Sri Lankan. AFP reported earlier that at least 37 were foreign citizens, including three Indian citizens, three British and two Turkish citizens. Earlier on Monday, Morrison said authorities had updated travel advice for Sri Lanka and that Australians should “reconsider [their] need to travel”. World leaders have condemned the attacks, which Pope Francis described as “cruel violence” in an Easter address on Sunday. Morrison said there “have been no conclusions made about who was behind the attack”. “I would caution people just to allow the investigation to take its course,” he said. “Right now, Sri Lanka is grieving. Australia is grieving. Two Australians have lost their lives in this terrible massacre. My heart is full of grief for them and their families.” Morrison added in a joint statement with the foreign minister, Marise Payne, that they had been in contact with the Sri Lankan government. “Australia is deeply shocked and saddened by the horrific terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka,” they said. “We have both been in contact with our counterparts, prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and foreign minister Tilak Marapana, today to convey Australia’s deepest condolences and to offer any support that they may require. “Australia stands with the people of Sri Lanka as they continue to come to terms with this senseless and barbaric attack. The Australian government utterly condemns all acts of terrorism and violence.”"
175,terror,"London Bridge attack: UK’s military interventions have fuelled terrorism, says Corbyn","Britain’s repeated military interventions have “exacerbated rather than resolved” the problem of terrorism, Jeremy Corbyn will warn today. The Labour leader will use a speech to warn that the so-called “war on terror has manifestly failed”, adding that the world is “living with the consequences” of the botched invasion of Iraq, which he opposed. He will say that Britain risks being “tied to Donald Trump’s coat-tails” and US foreign policy under Boris Johnson. His comments come just before Johnson hosts a Nato summit this week to be attended by the US president. Responding to the London Bridge attack in a speech in York, Corbyn will praise the “extraordinary bravery” of the public in confronting the attacker. He will say that the police were right to use lethal force, with lives at stake and the attacker wearing a fake suicide vest. However, he will also say that while responsibility for acts of terror lies with “the terrorists, their funders and recruiters”, UK leaders “have made the wrong calls on our security”. He will add: “The threat of terrorism cannot and should not be reduced to questions of foreign policy alone. But too often the actions of successive governments have fuelled, not reduced that threat. “Sixteen years ago, I warned against the invasion and occupation of Iraq. I said it would set off a spiral of conflict, hate, misery and desperation that will fuel the wars, the conflict, the terrorism and the misery of future generations. It did, and we are still living with the consequences today. “The war on terror has manifestly failed. Britain’s repeated military interventions in North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia have exacerbated, rather than resolved the problems.” Corbyn will criticise cuts and warn that real security cannot be done “on the cheap”. His comments come as the prime minister announces that he will conduct the most wide-ranging review of Britain’s security, defence and foreign policy since the end of the cold war if the Tories win the general election. No 10 revealed the plan after Friday’s London Bridge terror attack, in which two members of the public were killed and three taken to hospital for their injuries. However, Corbyn will argue today: “Take the probation service, part-privatised in 2014, resulting in disaster. The most serious cases stayed in a justice system badly undermined by austerity. A failure to recruit has left huge staffing shortfalls and with staff supervising more cases than ever expected, posing a serious risk to our security.”     Boris Johnson and the home secretary Priti Patel at the scene of the London Bridge stabbings. Photograph: Niklas Halle’n/AFP via Getty Images    Johnson said that the examination of the UK’s security capabilities would be bigger than previous reviews as it would cover not just the armed forces but also intelligence, counter-terrorism and serious and organised crime. The prime minister suggested it would also review strategic and diplomatic issues, such as Britain’s place in the world after Brexit. Johnson said: “It will also consider global Britain’s foreign policy: British alliances and diplomacy; shifts of power and wealth to Asia; how we can best use our huge expenditure on international development; and the role of technology.” Johnson insisted that despite Brexit the UK would want to strengthen cooperation with European Union nations on security, notwithstanding warnings from many EU leaders that Brexit will reduce UK involvement in organisations such as Europol and jeopardise access to its vital databases. Senior Tories are anxious that Trump, who, during his two-day visit, is expected to face protests from NHS staff fearful that the service will be at risk in a UK-US trade deal, may seek to intervene in the UK election campaign in a way that could backfire on the Conservatives. Trump is expected to be greeted on Tuesday evening outside Buckingham Palace by doctors, nurses and other NHS workers leading a protest of tens of thousands. They are planning to march from Trafalgar Square to Canada Gate when Trump and other Nato leaders meet the Queen at a 6pm drinks reception.    This week we would like you to rule out once and for all any increases to the cost of US drugs for our NHS  Open letter from NHS staff to President Trump     Last night 515 NHS nurses, doctors and other health professionals wrote an open letter to Trump demanding a guarantee that the NHS will not be targeted in any UK-US trade talks. “We are particularly concerned about conversations over patents for pharmaceuticals and the potential for huge drug price increases for the NHS,” the letter says. “To allay our worst fears, we request you publish new trade negotiating objectives that explicitly rule out any measures that will lead to changes to our pharmaceutical patent and procurement regime, explicitly state that the NHS is taken off the negotiating table. “Anything less than this will not reassure us and will leave thousands of dedicated NHS staff in fear for the future.”"
176,terror,The Day Shall Come review – Chris Morris’s overcooked FBI farce,"Billed as being “based on a hundred true stories”, this dark tragicomedy from co-writer/director Chris Morris paints a cracked portrait of counter-terrorism operations in the United States in which imagined enemies are eminently more imprisonable than their real-life counterparts. While The Day Shall Come may lack the breathtaking bite of Morris’s feature debut Four Lions or the experimental weirdness of his head-spinning TV show Jam, it does boast a fine cast, an alarming premise and a palpable sense of anger behind its increasingly absurdist comedy. Marchánt Davis is Moses, “sultan” of the “Star of Six community farm and mission” in Miami, which preaches salvation through a heady cocktail of education, mysticism and martial arts, inspired by the figure of Haitian rebel Toussaint Louverture. With his wife, Venus (Danielle Brooks), Moses is preparing for “the great inversion” – the revolution that will change the world. Crucially, this revolution will be achieved “without the gun weapon”, since Moses believes only in “weapons of tradition”, which appear to include a toy crossbow, imaginary ray guns and his own ability to bring down gentrifying cranes with his mind. With his tiny rag-tag group of reformed drug dealers turned kale farmers, Moses (who believes that God spoke to him through a duck) is clearly harmless, more devoted to his daughter, Rosa (Calah Lane), than to any genuine insurrection. But when the threat of eviction from his beloved farm looms, Moses is bamboozled into accepting an offer of money and guns from a Middle Eastern sponsor, apparently eager to fund “people building armies”. In fact he’s a plant, part of an increasingly desperate FBI ploy by ambitious agent Kendra Glack (Anna Kendrick) and her close-to-retirement boss Andy Mudd (Denis O’Hare) to bag a major terrorist conviction, whatever it takes. Next thing, Moses is riding a horse, planning to build a fence from AK-47s and apparently conspiring to deal in nuclear weapons thanks to a Kafkaeqsue fit-up without which (we are assured) “the Statue of Liberty is wearing a burqa and we’ve beheaded Bruce Springsteen”. Morris describes The Day Shall Come in theatrical terms, as the story of a fringe preacher trapped in a “false reality” that has been scripted by the FBI, a character in a play who doesn’t realise that his whole world is a stage. For Morris, this surreal scenario (inspired by, among others, the real-life case of the Liberty City Seven) is indicative of “an unfortunate truth that has brought farce to the heart of America’s homeland security project”, a paranoid post-9/11 fever in which “informants encourage a person of interest to break the law and when they do, the FBI arrests them”.           Watch a trailer for The Day Shall Come.    Within this pernicious (if somewhat overcooked) circle of absurdity, double-negatives abound, as purportedly counter-terrorist operatives attempt to create and supply supposed terrorists, who promptly turn themselves in to the authorities, hoping to claim a reward for crimes they haven’t committed. “Act nervous like you’re holding nukes,” one young “warrior” is told, “not nervous like you’re not holding nukes…” Inevitably, the spectre of Dr Strangelove is invoked, as Kendrick’s increasingly conflicted agent discovers that, in order to call off an accidentally manufactured WMD emergency, she must first declare a WMD emergency; only by acknowledging the existence of a nonexistent crisis can she stop it from existing. Amid such a self-perpetuating tornado of madness, the only way is up, with the unwitting Moses caught in the eye of the storm. Or, as Glack puts it: “His get-out-of-jail card is… going to jail.” None of this would pack a punch were it not for the powerful thread of pathos that runs through the drama. As with Four Lions, it’s the juxtaposition of domesticity and outrage that pays dividends, with Moses’s fracturing family life serving as a crucial counterpoint to the crazed machinations of the FBI’s plots. Aided by a sometimes surprisingly sensitive script (co-credited to Morris and Jesse Armstrong, with additional material by Sean Gray and Tony Roche), Davis turns Moses into a fully rounded character – foolish perhaps, but also blessed with a peculiar nobility. A scene in which Brooks’s Venus humours her husband’s psychokinetic delusions is beautifully played, adding a touch of magic to the down-to-earth pratfalls, injecting a much-needed element of love amid the escalating conflict. As for Kendrick, she stays on just the right side of caricature, playing it straight enough to lend necessary weight to the standoffs of the third act, as we head towards a satisfyingly unforgiving finale."
177,terror,"Love, loss and virtual memorials: my brother’s digital legacy","When my phone used to light up with my younger brother’s name, I always knew I could safely ignore it if I wanted to – whether it be a self-indulgent video of his latest attempt at Z-list fame or a harsh tweet about a celebrity I’d never heard of. Whatever. I even coined a sarcastic hashtag when replying to him: #nobodycaresmartyn. But then one nondescript morning in May 2017, my phone lit up with his name on all the notifications – hundreds of them – and there was no way I could ignore any of them. My brother was one of the 22 people killed in the Manchester Arena terror attack. He was 29. Losing him in this way meant I instantly went from an almost complete inexperience of grief to having to endure the most unexpectedly public form of loss imaginable.     Is losing him made easier by the rectangle of glass in my pocket?    In an ideal world – relatively speaking – you get your affairs in order when you are facing your own mortality, at least when you have the time to think about it. A person knowingly approaching their end writes a will, ties up loose ends and makes their peace. I’m not sure what I’d do – and I strongly suspect Martyn didn’t know either (although, curiously, his dramatic funeral was arranged in perfect accordance with his wishes, as discussed jokingly over many drinks with friends. Be careful what you morbidly joke about, because when your number is up those hazy musings quickly become event directions). The point is that part of making your mortal exit is drawing a line under your existence and leaving your legacy behind. Planting your flag and communicating to future observers: “I was here. I existed.” But sometimes the universe doesn’t extend you the courtesy of allowing you to shuffle your paperwork and settle your affairs in your own time. Despite this, even though he checked out quite ahead of schedule, in a strange way Martyn had already done some of the work himself, without realising it. Like the rest of my generation, my brother’s existence was eternally self-documented in detail across social media. It is an archive of self that he accidentally left behind and an example of what makes losing someone in the modern world an experience that’s unique to our time. It’s been bittersweet so far. Although the manner in which he died meant that there wasn’t any time to prepare, he left behind an unfathomably rich web of content – endless tendrils of his digital self, captured in imagery, video, music, writing and a truly breathtaking number of tweets. Although he was impressively prolific, it wasn’t ever completely raw – he carefully curated his online presence as it unfolded (photos taken from his good side strongly preferred, please, and don’t post them online without his sign-off, thank you). The abrupt end to this constant barrage of self-directed content means his online legacy has a stark truth about it that’s more powerful than anything he could have intentionally put together.     ‘His final tweets are still replied to by hundreds of other users, years after his death.’ Photograph: Martyn Hett    The digital mixed-media self-portrait he created in these spaces is, in many ways, the real him, rather than whatever planned content I’m sure he’d have put together had he had the luxury of a little time to work on his media strategy (and believe me, he would have). That technology underpinned the entire experience wasn’t just in his use of it – it was in our use of it, too. Family, community, press, police, rubberneckers. It was my smartphone that lit up when the attack happened; social media where we put the word out about him being missing and circulated his photograph, and online platforms that ultimately let people know when we’d found out what happened to him. It was, of course, also social media that worked as an easy vector for fairly hostile press intrusion, something that began literally after the attack and in many ways continues to this day. More importantly, though, social media still plays a critical role in the story: it allows me, my family, his friends and anyone else to explore the digital legacy that he’s built. His social feeds still exist, but the channels are paused – he was writing and broadcasting until the very last moment; his final transmission being a tweet complaining about the toilet queues in the arena. His broadcast stopped there. He did what many of us do most days – built a digital footprint, filled with imagery and notes and videos and a million other captured moments, fragments, pieces of the trail that make up you as a person (or at least, the version of your online self you’ve chosen to present to the world, be that accurate or not). These fragments of digital ephemera have now become intangible virtual memorials. Some are improvised, like his final tweets that are still replied to by hundreds of other users, years after his death. Others are more planned – Martyn’s personal Facebook page was quickly and officially “memorialised” in a surprisingly sensitive way by Facebook, but (as I’m sure he’d howl laughing at) this contrasts wildly with the wholly inappropriate header image and scathing posts underneath. He was here and then he wasn’t, but everything he’s created remains exactly how he left it, as it will when you or I check out – expected or not. My brother and I sit squarely in that curious generational overlap where we existed as children without digital technology or the internet, but suddenly had it bestowed upon us as teenagers. This abrupt connection totally re-wired how we existed as young people and, subsequently, as adults. Put another way, I’m old enough to remember nervously calling the house phone of a girlfriend and praying her father didn’t pick up, but at the same time I’m young enough that my angsty teenage diary entries were posted to early online journalling sites, and not scrawled into the traditional hidden notebook. This contrast, this rapid-onset unveiling of our digital selves, has been a huge factor in how and why my generation has taken to social media, and why my brother and I both went full tilt with it from the minute it was something we could use to broadcast with. Now, in 2020, this progress has had a human impact in ways I didn’t expect. In my pocket is a tiny miracle of engineering that allows me to access the sum of human knowledge, reach out to almost anyone on the planet, and indeed call up a perfect video recording of my departed brother.     ‘Martyn carefully curated his online presence.’ Photograph: Martyn Hett    The really big companies that shepherd our online existences are incredibly good at what they do, but Martyn’s death has shown me that many digital entities handle tricky things like death and difficult human “stuff” really badly. I build things with technology for a living, and in my job we sometimes call these things “squishy” problems – awkward human problems that can’t be solved easily with data points and algorithms, and need a human hand (and human empathy) to correct. This is a phenomenon that will affect us more and more as AI and machine-learning technologies take over more of our computational heavy lifting. But it still feels like we’re a long way off knowing how to deal with it. I found this out in the blackest of ways while standing at the site of the bomb blast in the arena a few weeks later, speechless at the damage. He’d laugh, I’m sure, at the notion of Facebook helpfully asking me to “check in” to let my friends know how much fun I was having… More broadly, the digital behemoths of social media are beginning to reach a tipping point where the demand for usernames is outstripping supply. Twitter recently announced (and then hastily retracted) a proposed cull of what they deem to be inactive accounts. It’s quite a loaded word though – inactive – isn’t it? The accounts of the lost are certainly inactive in a literal sense, but they still have a reason to be there: they have meaning to people, and that’s what makes them active for so many.     ‘The accounts of the lost are inactive in a literal sense but they still have meaning to people’: Martyn and Dan Hett, as children. Photograph: Family Picture    The data can be downloaded and saved, but the notion that one of these inadvertent crystallisations of my brother’s digital self could arbitrarily disappear is a challenging one, not least because there could feasibly be a day where the account is gone and someone else takes the name. When streams of online activity abruptly cease broadcasting, they don’t disappear, they become vital archives that are, for now, permanent. We’re only a decade or two away from reaching that macabre milestone on long-standing platforms such as Facebook where accounts belonging to dead users outnumber the accounts of the living. Martyn’s digital legacy continues to inspire and be built upon, even within my own work. Understandably, my creative output effectively ceased when Martyn died. Over time, as we rebuilt, I found my work changing direction, too. For the past few years I’ve been engaged in creating introspective experimental video games and digital artworks that explore grief, loss and, increasingly, the nature of going through this process in a world powered by technology that is in a constant state of flux. I’m now creating bigger and more ambitious work that examines radicalisation and extremism, and our fragmented existences within digital spaces. I’m using technology to not just look at the loss I experienced, but ask how we got here and why any of this happened. Not all of this work is about Martyn, but all of it is because of him – and quietly for him. Living each moment as if it’s your last is a well-worn cliché, but in 2020 it might be more accurate to settle for updating your status as if it’s your last. Inevitably, without knowing, you’ll have inadvertently written the closing sentence of the terribly self-indulgent story you’ve spent your whole life creating. Was it the grand sign-off you wanted, or a throwaway tweet about the train being late? I wonder which of those would be more truthful, and whether or not this is important to those looking back at it from the future? I wonder, too, whether those facing their mortality with a little more notice than my brother had may end up with more than the trail of annoying nonsense he left behind by accident. The nonsense is his truth, in a way. I often question whether losing someone is made more difficult, or easier, by the fact I have a rectangle of glass in my pocket that can find the sound of his voice, in seconds, at any time. I can sit with my two young children, watching Uncle Martyn’s idiot grin and hearing his ceaselessly irritating cackling, and when I see them smile back at it, I have my answer.     Mourners gather: partner Russell Hayward (centre) at Martyn’s funeral. Photograph: Dave Thompson/Getty Images    As a society it feels as if we’re still adjusting to the effects of this constant digital capture, not least when it comes to thorny human problems, like losing someone. We’re rapidly traversing technological and ethical ground that nobody has covered before. For better or worse, we are currently part of the first generation in history to inhabit a world where the living, and increasingly the dead, are documented with such accuracy. This shift has taken place incredibly quickly, and it’s easy to forget that, within living memory, the sum total of most people’s visual existence was contained in a handful of printed photographs. The rest was passed down as stories, retellings, memories. Over time the clarity faded, the person moved in and out of focus, became invisible. Our enormous advancements in technology (and our willingness to embrace them) mean that, for the first time, that image never blurs or fades, but lives on. The meaning of this is subtle, yet profound: the way we look at death itself has changed for ever. There are ghosts in our machines, and I’m glad we have them."
178,terror,A win against Isis can’t mask fundamental problems in the US response to terrorism,"Taking out one of the leaders of the Islamic State is a symbolic and tangible achievement in blunting Isis’s influence. The work of the US military, intelligence agencies and partners on the ground made this possible. And as much as Trump wants to claim personal credit, the success of the raid only highlighted the dangers of his haphazard withdrawal of US troops from Syria: the New York Times reports that the success of the raid occurred “in spite of” Trump’s recent Syria moves, as the Kurds were the key partners providing intelligence and the US military was concerned they wouldn’t get another shot at Baghdadi because intelligence would be significantly reduced after the US withdrawal. But the circumstances surrounding the raid and its announcement raise broader concerns about the nature of America’s counterterrorism policies. Trump’s announcement itself was disturbing – even setting aside the completely inappropriate description of the death, the unnecessary divulsion of details about the raid and Trump’s self-congratulatory comments making the event about himself. The very fact that we treat the killing of a single terrorist like a national event reveals how our national security priorities are sometimes out of order. Obama’s announcement of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden seemed appropriate, as it felt in part like closure after 3,000 Americans were killed on 9/11 (and Obama’s solemn remarks marked it with the right tone). But presidents hardly ever address the nation when a climate deal is reached or a peacekeeping mission helps deter violence. This may be because presidents feel the need to garner public support for the use of the military abroad, but it’s just as easily chalked up to the overly militaristic approach the US has adopted to counter-terrorism, and how deeply leaders feel the need to look tough in the face of terrorism. The announcement also reinforced how the fear factor of terrorism can dominate US national security policy and how irresponsible politicians like Trump use that fear to pursue dangerous policies. The rise of Isis – the gruesome videos of murder, attacks abroad, and the fact that Isis controlled territory – was deadly serious. While pursuing a military campaign along with allies, Obama was criticized for trying to keep the threat in perspective for Americans. During the 2016 campaign and since Trump on the other hand has played on the public’s fear, linking Isis to immigration to scare people. And the public’s fear of terrorism, despite the chances of being hurt by terrorism are virtually none, keeps counter-terrorism efforts at a much more prominent place in national discourse and policy making than they should be. The raid was possible because of a US military presence in the area, but the global war on terror has driven the US to have a significantly expanded global military presence for counter-terrorism purposes – a trend that should concern Americans. While the US has improved its intelligence and other capabilities to detect and prevent terrorism since 9/11, it has often used the military as a tool of first resort, from Afghanistan to Iraq and beyond. The US military is sometimes the only option for going after terrorists, but we are not nearly cautious enough about its use. Not only does this approach militarize US relationships with countries, but it also means that the military tools end up with outsized influence in determining US policies. It doesn’t have to be that way: A new Cap study shows that Americans want leaders to focus on terrorism, but don’t want to treat it like a military problem. Moreover, almost every time we announce a military operation today it is a stark reminder that Congress likely has not voted to use force in those countries. Congress has never explicitly voted to authorize military operations in Yemen or against Isis in Iraq or Syria. While Congress has appropriated funds to fight certain conflicts – and thereby could be construed as approving them – the 2001 AUMF is being stretched to justify CT efforts almost 20 years later. No wonder the US military’s global footprint looks the way it does – with Congress unwilling to vote on military conflicts, there’s little standing in the way of a president who wants to expand that presence. The news about Baghdadi came in the midst of an increasingly rare bipartisan moment, with members of both parties criticizing Trump’s decision to withdraw US troops from Syria in a disastrous fashion. The criticism is justified; the way in which Trump withdrew the troops has been catastrophic, resulting in freed Isis terrorists, abandoning the Kurds to a grim fate, helping Russia, Iran and Syria. But the very fact that America’s political parties – at loggerheads on just about everything – can agree that removing troops from a foreign conflict (no matter how badly it was done) is worthy of condemnation is a deeply worrying sign about the politics of national security. One can see a similar dynamic on Afghanistan where far too many leaders of all parties seem content with having thousands of US troops there in perpetuity fighting a war that few seem to focus on. Yes, decisions about military force – using it and ending its use – are difficult. And yes, there was a much better way to strategically draw down the US troop presence, and even a good case for keeping troops there longer. But since 9/11 we too often shy away from reducing our military presence for fear of the unknown as opposed to leaning towards bringing home the troops as soon as possible. And so one less ruthless terrorist in the world is good news. But we should stop measuring our counter-terrorism efforts by how many terrorists we kill or our security by how many US troops are deployed."
179,terror,US was 'certain' Rwandan pair in Australia were members of banned 'terror group',"The attorney who brought charges against two Rwandan men recently resettled in Australia says the United States was “certain” they were members of a Hutu rebel group that was later designated a terror group by the US government. The comments again raise questions about how the pair managed to pass Australia’s tough and vigorously applied character and security checks, under which others have been deported for minor offences or historical associations with criminal groups. The two men were members of the Army for the Liberation of Rwanda, an offshoot of armed militias responsible for the country’s 1994 genocide, and were accused of the targeted murder of western tourists in Uganda in 1999.   Related: Resettlement of Rwandan rebels labelled a 'frustrating' hypocrisy    They were brought to Australia in a secret deal with the US last year, and Scott Morrison has said they were assessed and cleared by security agencies. The prime minister said the agencies had assessed the specific allegations against the pair and they were “not found to be upheld in their view, and as a result they were allowed to come to Australia”. But the federal prosecutor responsible for extraditing and bringing charges against the men said the US government had been confident in the evidence. “I don’t have any comment on Mr Morrison’s claims,” Roscoe Howard Jr told Guardian Australia. “However, at the time, the United States was certain the crime against a US citizen was committed, and was certain the two gentlemen were part of a group that committed the crime. “They were originally extradited to the United States to stand trial because of the confidence that we had in the evidence and our ability to show at a trial beyond a reasonable doubt their guilt.” Howard stressed he was not speaking on behalf of the current District of Columbia attorney, who could not be reached by Guardian Australia before publication. He also said the proceedings had been more than a decade ago and he was not the prosecuting assistant, who would have better firsthand knowledge of the case. The US trial against the pair collapsed after a court found they had been subjected to prolonged and disturbing torture by Rwandan forces before they gave shifting, inconsistent confessions. The pair could not be returned to Rwanda because of a reasonable fear of persecution, but were not granted asylum in the US, leaving them languishing in detention limbo. Australia took them as part of its deal with the US and they were processed by Australian authorities between April and July last year. In a much-publicised 2016 call between Malcolm Turnbull and Donald Trump, the former prime minister pledged to help the US with problematic cases. Turnbull told the president that Australia would take people that the previous Obama administration “were very keen on getting out of the United States”. “We will take more,” he said. “We will take anyone that you want us to take.” The decision to accept the two men appears to be at odds with the government’s otherwise hard line on assessments of character. The “character test” allows it to reject or cancel visas if it reasonably suspects applicants have had links to criminal groups. The character test has been used with increasing vigour since 2014, when powers were broadened. The government can choose not to use the character test, and can approve visas if it believes this to be in the national interest.   graph   New Zealand citizens who have lived in Australia long term have been deported for minor historical offences or old links to criminal groups. The Rwandan pair – Gregoire Nyaminani and Leonidas Bimenyimana – were both found to be members of the Army for the Liberation of Rwanda in the US courts. Court documents show they joined it after witnessing or being victim to horrific acts of violence. Nyaminani reached the rank of first sergeant, according to the documents, and Bimenyimana was a second lieutenant. They were captured by Rwandan government forces during battles in 2001 and 2002. One survivor of the 1999 attack in Uganda has cast doubt on whether the pair were actually directly responsible for the murders. Elizabeth Garland, a US researcher, said the sheer number of those involved in the attack – between 100 and 150 – made her suspicious that those who committed the murders had actually been captured. “It seemed very improbable that they would have caught the men that did the killing of the American victims, given the number of people involved in the attack,” she told the ABC. Morrison was approached for comment."
180,terror,Australian telcos block dozens of websites hosting Christchurch terror video,"A site that explicitly stated it would not host the horrific Christchurch terror video has been blocked by Australian telcos in an “extraordinary” effort to censor dozens of websites. Telstra, Vodafone and Optus have all confirmed they are actively blocking Australian customers on their networks from accessing websites that hosted the Christchurch terror video. None of the three telcos would say which sites had been blocked. The blocks are temporary and will be lifted when the footage is removed. The decision was made independently by telcos following industry-wide discussions, without any direction from law enforcement or the courts. Facebook and Twitter were not targeted, despite hosting the video.   Related: 'A perfect platform': internet's abyss becomes a far-right breeding ground    Guardian Australia understands this is because they are taking active steps of their own to remove the material from their pages. Many mainstream media outlets have also shown the video on their site, including News.com.au, which remains accessible. But LiveLeak, a video sharing site known for often showing disturbing content, has been blocked by Telstra, Vodafone and Optus. The video initially appeared on LiveLeak, but was soon scrubbed and is no longer available in searches. LiveLeak told its users in a statement on Monday that it was refusing to carry the video because it did not want to “indulge” the perpetrator by carrying his propaganda and that it had received “no small number of complaints” regarding the fact that it would not carry the video of the shooting in New Zealand, streamed live on Facebook. “The Christchurch shooter wasn’t just some random ‘nutcase’. He planned not just the murders but also the chaos he would sow with his manifesto which reads like the fevered dream of a fully fledged ‘shitposter’.” “Currently, judging by media coverage and reactions online, he’s getting almost exactly what he wanted. We don’t intend to indulge him further.” Optus, Telstra and Vodafone were approached for comment on their decision to block LiveLeak. Optus referred questions about LiveLeak to the Communications Alliance, whose chief executive, John Stanton, spoke more generally about the blocks.   Related: Andrew Bolt and my other media colleagues seem incapable of self-reflection after Christchurch | Gay Alcorn    “Due to the extraordinary circumstances, several large ISPs in Australia have taken the decision to voluntarily implement temporary blocks of websites that continue to host footage of the Christchurch terrorist attack video,” Stanton said. “These ISPs have sought to balance community expectations to remove access to the video with the need to minimise any inconvenience that may arise from legitimate content being blocked as an unavoidable, temporary consequence.” Vodafone said in a statement it had blocked “dozens of sites” still hosting the footage “We understand users trying to access these sites for legitimate purposes may be inconvenienced but we believe it’s the right thing to do in these extreme circumstances to help stop the further distribution of this video,” it said in a statement. “In Australia, blocking requests are generally made via the courts or law enforcement agencies however, this is an extreme case which we think required an extraordinary response.” “There were industry discussions in relation to this issue and we did make enquiries with various agencies but this is a decision Vodafone Australia made independently.”   Related: The 'dog whistling' on immigration must stop, Bill Shorten says    Such blocks are generally considered ineffective and easily bypassed. Users on the online forum Reddit are already rubbishing the blocks and the ease at which they can be evaded. Also on Tuesday, Facebook revealed that the livestream of the attack was viewed 200 times during the live broadcast, and no one reported the content. “Including the views during the live broadcast, the video was viewed about 4,000 times in total before being removed from Facebook,” the Facebook vice-president Chris Sonderby said. “The first user report on the original video came in 29 minutes after the video started, and 12 minutes after the live broadcast ended.”"
181,terror,How Home Office used terror-related law on highly skilled migrants,"They are teachers, doctors, scientists and engineers. Most have British-born children. Many have lived legally in the UK for a decade or more, but all are now on the verge of destitution, forbidden from working, using the NHS, renting property or receiving benefits. Their offence? To have made legal amendments to their tax returns. For that, the Home Office has fought – often for years – to force them to leave the UK under a law designed, in part, to tackle terrorism and people judged to be a threat to national security.   Related: A life 'completely destroyed' by one paragraph of immigration law    Now a court ruling has shed light on a once obscure but, thanks to the Guardian’s extensive coverage, now-notorious paragraph 322(5) of the immigration rules. The appeal court found that the “general approach [by the home secretary, Sajid Javid] in all earnings discrepancy cases [has been] legally flawed” and must changeuse of . Paragraph 322(5) had been used to try to force 1,697 highly skilled people out of the UK in just over three years  The paragraph was not written to catch tax discrepancies; it was designed to tackle the UK’s most serious offenders. It says a person is deemed to be “undesirable … in the light of his conduct (including convictions …), character or associations or the fact that he represents a threat to national security”. The court concluded that the Home Office proceeded directly from finding discrepancies in reported earnings to a decision that they were the result of dishonesty without giving people the opportunity to “proffer an innocent explanation”. The government’s guidance on 322(5) makes clear how serious an offence needs to be for the discretionary power to be invoked: “The main types of cases you need to consider for refusal under paragraph 322(5) … are those that involve criminality, a threat to national security, war crimes or travel bans.” The threshold is high because the consequences are severe: people refused under 322(5) have just 14 days to lodge an appeal or must leave when their current visa expires. They are ineligible for any other UK visa and are not allowed to return to the UK for 10 years. Some are allowed to stay and appeal against the refusal. But this will cost tens of thousands of pounds and take years – often costing them their jobs, homes, savings and, in some cases, their health and that of their children. This is because, once a visa application is refused under paragraph 322(5), people are not allowed to work, rent property or access the NHS. They are not entitled to asylum support or mainstream benefits, nor are they allowed to open a bank account or hold a driving licence. In a short space of time, people – most of whom have been paying high rates of tax, running British companies, employing British workers and contributing to society – become destitute. In some cases, they have sold everything they owned to pay for life-saving healthcare for their British-born children. More than one told the Guardian: “It’s like they’re trying to starve us out.” These families feel they have no choice but to stay and fight because leaving the UK under paragraph 322(5) means they are highly unlikely to get a visa to visit or work anywhere in the world ever again.   Related: 'I feel like I'm drowning': healthcare inspector faces deportation by Home Office    The stories the Guardian reported on included a wide range of professionals: a specialist computer programmer; a pharmaceutical specialist who came to the UK to help develop anti-cancer and anti-psychotic drugs, and an engineer who trained others for the Ministry of Justice. They included families who were struggling to deal with serious illness: the two British-born children with lifelong, complex physical and mental disabilities; a seriously ill Nigerian woman who had to beg for the right to work so she could afford the medication she needed to stay alive while appealing against 322(5); and a widower, forbidden from working, who was the sole carer of his four-year-old involved in a case that even the Home Office’s lawyers advised it to drop. No one the Guardian spoke to had committed a crime. What they had done was follow the HMRC’s guidance that “both HMRC and its customers can exercise their right to correct, adjust or amend a filed return”. HMRC did not consider that a crime – or even a mistake requiring a punitive fine – occurred in any of the cases the Guardian investigated. As further 322(5) stories were published, politicians began to take notice. Lord Taverne, a former financial secretary to the Treasury, accused the Home Office of presiding over “a national scandal, every bit as outrageous as the treatment of the Windrush immigrants”. In a meeting of the same home affairs select committee, the Labour MP Naz Shah told the home secretary, Sajid Javid, that the use of 322(5) “smacks of the Windrush scandal”. The government scrambled to limit the damage. Javid promised a review but increasing numbers of MPs were discovering they had constituents fighting paragraph 322(5) rulings. The Scottish National party MP Alison Thewliss, having found she represented at least five highly skilled migrants in such circumstances, called a debate in Westminster Hall on the issue.   Related: Engineer deemed security threat over tax error gets visa in Home Office U-turn    Finally, in November, the government was forced to publish its long-awaited review. It revealed that between January 2015 and May 2018, the Home Office had wrongly tried to force at least 300 highly skilled migrants to leave Britain, with a further 87 having already left and another 400 potentially affected. Despite public condemnation and the findings of its own review, refusals under 322(5) continued. In the background, however, the courts were quietly overturning case after case until the government had to admit that 65% of 322(5) appeals were successful – a rate that is a third higher than immigration appeals overall. Eventually, the court of appeal, realising it was seeing increasing numbers of appeals against 322(5), linked four different cases together. Campaigners hope the ruling will finally deal a hammer blow to the government’s use of paragraph 322(5) against highly skilled migrants. • This article was amended on 19 April 2019 to more fully explain and quote from the appeal court’s ruling and to correct an earlier version which suggested that some of those refused under paragraph 322(5) had 14 days to leave. That should have said “14 days to lodge an appeal”."
182,terror,New Zealand cuts dozens of Anzac events over Christchurch terror risk,"More than 50 Anzac events and parades have been cut in New Zealand’s largest city at the request of police, as the country’s terror risk remains high in the wake of the deadly Christchurch mosque attacks. Police have asked Auckland Returned Serviceman’s Associations (RSA) to “consolidate” their events, with the total number reduced from 84 last year to 26 this year, allowing officers to better protect large crowds in attendance. Auckland is New Zealand’s largest city and home to more than 1.6 million people. In the wake of the Christchurch attack it has been suggested that large Anzac crowds could provide an easy target.   Related: Christchurch shooting accused faces victims' relatives in court on 50 murder charges    A statement from Auckland Council confirmed the reduced services was a direct result of the Christchurch attacks. “In the current heightened security environment, police have agreed to maintain a visible presence at events for public reassurance,” the statement read. “As a result, police had recommended that Anzac Day events in Auckland be consolidated so that they could adequately resource each public gathering.” New Zealand police assistant commissioner Mike Rusbatch said it was important to note that police had “no information” to indicate a threat to any Anzac service. “However in the current environment it is important that members of the public attending Anzac events remain vigilant,” Rusbatch said, adding the police presence at services would be high and visible. Last month a lone gunman shot dead 50 people at two mosques in central Christchurch, prompting the country’s counter-terrorism department to raise the country’s threat risk to high for the first time ever. A high terror risk means “a terrorist attack is assessed as very likely”, according to the prime minister’s office. Many RSA’s voluntarily cancelled their planned commemorations in the days and weeks following the mosque attacks, but others have now done so to comply with police requests. A spokesman for RSA said there had been no cancellations in other parts of the country, or plans for a beefed up security presence. On Tuesday United Nations refugee chief Filippo Grandi warned that the Christchurch mosque attacks were the result of the worst toxicity in politics and media toward refugees, migrants and foreigners that he had witnessed in more than 30 years. “I have never seen such toxicity, such poison in the language of politics, in media, in social media, even in everyday discussions and conversations around this issue,” Grandi told the UN Security Council. Thirteen people shot in the Christchurch mosque attacks remain in hospital, as reports emerge that some families of the killed and injured are struggling to access financial support promised by the Labour coalition government in the days following the worst mass shooting in New Zealand’s modern history."
183,terror,Paris police HQ attack: search continues in bid to find killer’s motive,"French detectives are continuing to work to establish the motive of a state employee who killed four colleagues with a kitchen knife inside Paris’s police headquarters on Thursday. The assailant, named in the media as Mickaël H, 45, was a computer scientist in the intelligence branch at police headquarters, and had worked for the service for 15 years. He was was stationed in one of the most important departments, which coordinated anti-terrorist intelligence-gathering in the capital. Investigators are still attempting to determine why at lunchtime on Thursday, deep inside the vast police complex near Notre Dame in the centre of Paris, the man took a ceramic knife and went on a killing rampage that lasted only a few minutes. First, in an office in his own department, he killed three police officers. Then he killed another staff member and injured two more in a stairway before heading towards the exit. A young intern police officer, who had worked in the building for only a few days, called for the man to drop the knife. When he did not, the officer shot him in the head, killing him. Police on Friday continued to search the assailant’s home in a small town near Charles de Gaulle airport north of Paris. Data from his computers and phones was also being assessed. Within hours of the attack, investigators in balaclavas were seen removing computer equipment from the property. Questions remain over what might have led the man to carry out the attack, whether it was personal or premeditated and whether he entered the building with a knife. There were no surviving witnesses from the room where he first attacked and killed three officers, so it was not clear what he may have said to them as he launched the attack.   Paris map: police HQ killings on 3 October   The attacker was said to be a quiet and unassuming member of staff, and no change in his behaviour had been noted in the weeks before the attack. The interior minister, Christophe Castaner, said the assailant had “never shown any behavioural problems” and never aroused the “slightest reason for alarm”. The incident is so far being investigated by a regular Paris police unit and being treated as a case of homicide, not terrorism. The investigation has so far not been referred to anti-terrorist police. Officials said there was no indication the attack was an act of terror, but the Paris police chief, Didier Lallement, told reporters on Friday no theory was being ruled out at this stage. He said the Paris police force “will be forever marked by this drama. We will not forget.” The attacker’s widow told investigators that her husband, who had a severe hearing disability, displayed “unusual and agitated behaviour” the night before his crime, a source close to the investigation told AFP. The assailant had converted to Islam 18 months ago, but initial searches at his home showed no sign of any radicalisation. He was not on any watchlist. The government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye urged caution. She said the possibility of a terror motive had not been ruled out but she added: “It is important to emphasise: you are not a terrorist because you are Muslim and converting to Islam is not an automatic sign of radicalisation.” She told France Info radio: “The facts need to be looked at carefully.” The attack came a day after thousands of officers marched in Paris to protest against low wages, long hours and an increasing suicide rate in their ranks."
184,terror,Our son the terror suspect: Jack Letts’s parents on the fight to save their child,"Sitting talking to Sally Lane and John Letts at their dining table in their terraced house in Oxford, a series of questions nag in my head. One is: “What might be the limits to parental love?” As husband and wife piece together once again the story of how their eldest son, Jack, then 18, took himself off to Jordan on holiday five years ago and ended up in the newly formed Islamic State in Iraq and Syria – a journey that eventually landed him in a Kurdish prison camp and put them through a hellish court ordeal – it is hard not to wonder just a little about that word “unconditional”. Their recent court case at the Old Bailey, three and a half years after their initial arrests, itself seemed designed to test that idea to breaking point. Letts, 58, an organic farmer, and Lane, 57, who had worked in publishing and for the NHS, were convicted on one charge of “funding terrorism”, and acquitted of another. A third charge was left on file after the jury failed to reach a verdict. Their crime had been to send, at the request of their son, the sum of £223 to an intermediary in Lebanon in September 2015, in part to pay for a pair of glasses. There was no suggestion that they believed they were sending the money to Isis, the court accepted, but it found them guilty of knowing there was a risk that the cash might fall into the wrong hands. They were found not guilty of trying and failing to wire a further payment of £1,000 later that year. That was needed, they believed, for Jack to pay a people-smuggler to help him escape the “caliphate” after he had denounced Isis as “un-Islamic” and had apparently been on the run in fear of his life.    It’s nice that we are not in prison, I suppose. Though at least if you are in prison, you know there is nothing you can do  John Letts     Letts and Lane were sentenced to 15 months in prison, suspended for a year. The investigation and legal case cost an estimated £7m. The verdict and sentence were, in Lane’s view, engineered so “everyone went home happy. All that money did not appear to have been wasted. We didn’t go to prison. The prosecutor was beaming at the verdict, because she had made her point. And the jury, who by then appeared bored silly by the whole thing, could finally go home.” When I sat down with them a week after this verdict, last Sunday afternoon, I began to ask if they were relieved the trial was over, but their tense and exhausted faces made it clear such a question was beside the point. One long legal case has simply given way to another: the battle to get their son, now 23, home to face justice here – or in Letts’s native Canada – from the north Syrian prison camp where he has been held for more than two years without trial. “There is no less stress now,” Letts says. “It’s nice that we are not in prison, I suppose. Though at least if you are in prison, you know there is nothing you can do.” Instead, their waking hours are consumed with framing arguments to governments who have no wish to hear them. I first met Lane and Letts back in January. I had come across a Twitter account that Lane had set up in which she mentioned how the local jobcentre had advised her to move cities if she wanted to find work. I’d contacted her in the first instance to sympathise with that situation and to see if she might want to talk about it. Over a lunch of home-made soup and bread she and her husband went through the nightmare of the previous years, in which they had not only lived in constant fear for their son, but had also lost their livelihoods and something close to their sanity. A contempt-of-court restriction had left them unable to speak in public about any aspect of their situation or Jack’s. After lunch that day John Letts, who has a contrarian’s intellectual energy, took me on a drive to introduce me to his former life. He had worked for a time as a roof thatcher when he first came to Britain in the 1980s, and had subsequently revolutionised the idea of “heritage grain” with 15 years of research into ancient strains of wheat and rye, culled from old thatch, to redevelop lost varieties with unique sustainable qualities. Prince Charles was a fan, and grew his crops at Highgrove; to celebrate the partnership Letts had given the prince a scythe as a present, with a Canadian maple handle.

Photograph: Counter Terrorism Policing South East/PA    At about the time Jack went to the Middle East Letts had finally got the business to the point where it was gaining national and international recognition. Because of restrictions placed on his and Lane’s time and finances since their arrest, however, he feared his research would be lost and passed his work on to others. He took me to a few places where his knowledge still thrived: first to Hamblin’s bakery in Oxford, which used his magical wheat in its fabulous bread, and then to Toad, an artisan distillery that was using the ancient rye grains he had developed to make unique gins and vodkas. While we drove Letts had elaborated on the ways in which he had lost his son. He stressed some of the difficulties Jack had faced, mental health issues that saw him drop out of the sixth form of Cherwell school nearby, and the problems of getting help for him. Jack had been diagnosed with an obsessive-compulsive disorder and with Tourette syndrome. Letts painted a picture of a troubled but highly sociable teenager, a boy who had sailed through his GCSEs, who had previously been identified as gifted in English and maths; a son with whom he loved to argue the toss about religion and politics and everything else. When Lane and Letts appeared in court a very different narrative was told about Jack. The prosecution focused on the messages that had been uncovered from online accounts in his name. The most infamous of them included a savage death threat, a wish to perform “a martyrdom operation” against an old school acquaintance who had joined the British army. Sally Lane had confronted her son about that post and threatened to disown him, but now both parents maintained that his accounts had been hijacked by Isis sympathisers. Lane was cross-examined for three days on every exchange she’d had with her son. Letts did not give evidence on advice from their lawyers. Instead the prosecution went line-by-line through his emails to Jack. “A father should never live to see his son buried,” Letts pleaded to him in September 2014. Another message read: “Jack, I’ve never begged you before but I am now. Please contact us. Your mother is collapsing with fear and sadness … You don’t have to die to help your fellow Muslims.” The five long years of worry have taken their toll on them as a couple. They are so familiar with the complex nuances of the case that it has become a kind of tetchy shorthand between them. When I arrived at their home last week I was not out of the hall before they were in a clipped argument about what documents they could send me to shed light on Jack’s current situation. At the heart of all this remains their attempt to square the child they raised – the child present in golden, smiley photographs of family holidays – with the figure conjured by the prosecution in court. They trace this disjunction back to the Sunday Times article of January 2016, which coined the name “Jihadi Jack” for their son alongside a now familiar picture of him in combat trousers in Raqqa. The story gave Isis a white and middle-class face for the first time – stoking a fear in every parent with a child on a gap year.     John Letts and Sally Lane outside the Old Bailey in London after their conviction last month. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA    In the public mind it is that image of “Jihadi Jack” that has taken hold. I have listened to enough radio phone-ins and followed enough social media to know that the loudest public voices agree with the TV verdict of Piers Morgan on the case, that he didn’t care if Jack Letts was left to rot in a Kurdish jail for ever: “If you go to fight in Syria, that’s the way the cookie crumbles.” That is not what Letts and Lane can allow themselves to think. They point to the fact that 400 of the 900 British nationals who went to Syria to support Isis have now been repatriated. (The home secretary, Sajid Javid, gave a statement confirming that number in February, in a Commons exchange in which it emerged that “only about 40” of those 400 had or would face trial.) You can see how, as this quiet “policy” has been enacted, it might have been useful politics to keep one or two vivid individuals still in Syria in the public eye. Shamima Begum, the Bethnal Green teenager, was the first. Since she has been stripped of her British nationality and after her child died in a refugee camp, the spotlight has shifted to Jack Letts. Jack’s case for repatriation has not been advanced in recent months by the attention surrounding his parents’ trial. A series of TV interviews with him from prison included his admission to the BBC that he had been “an enemy of Britain” and once would have been prepared to carry out a suicide bombing – though he expressed what looked like heartfelt regret for those positions now.    I have always said that if we find something he has done wrong, I will be the first to condemn it.    His parents offer two determined arguments in his defence. The first is their belief that when he gave those interviews he was under duress from his jailers. They have little detail of the conditions in which Jack has been held, beyond an early report he gave to the Canadian authorities in which he said he was in a cell of 30 men and only eight beds, and they were allowed out for 20 minutes a day. He maintains that he has been tortured in custody. That view is supported by the civil rights advocate Clive Stafford Smith, the founder of Reprieve, who met Jack in prison. He spoke to him a couple of weeks after the BBC report and said that Jack wished to make clear the circumstances of that interview: “He had been taken to a place proximate to where he had been tortured, had been asked many of the same questions that he has been asked under torture, and he had been bound to give the same false answers because the people in charge of his torture were there.” The BBC contends that Jack Letts gave full consent to the interview and thus all protocols were followed.

Photograph: Courtesy of Sally Lane &amp; John Letts/Courtesy of John Letts    Jack’s parents’ second argument in mitigation is that their son went to Iraq for humanitarian reasons; however sympathetic he might have been originally to the idea of the “caliphate”, he was a gentle soul, never a fighter. “He was a white Englishman, surely Isis would have used him in recruitment videos and so on if he was involved…” Lane says. “Or there would be pictures of him posing with guns.” “He was always talking about learning Arabic so he could help in a hospital or teach,” John Letts says. “He was inspired by the Arab spring and horrified by the war in Syria and the 6 million refugees.” John clings to a last exchange of an ITV interview where his son said of his prison, “If I have to stay here longer so you can get the women and children out first, that’s OK”. “I was really proud of him saying that,” Letts says. “Of course people will read that and say: ‘You are proud of Jihadi Jack – you have to be insane!’ But I’m sorry, from my perspective he is still a decent kid. I have always said that if we find something he has done wrong, I will be the first to condemn it. Until then, am I supposed to just believe what the Daily Mail says about my son?” Lane subsequently sends me the printouts of messaging exchanges they had with Jack while he claimed to be in hiding from Isis in Raqqa between March 2016 and July 2017. Initially he was trying to organise for them to send money so he could escape. Some of the exchanges between mother and son capture the cadences of family banter; others take in the surreal contrasts between Oxford and Raqqa, food shopping and Russian air strikes. Often Jack responds to questions about his safety, about his lack of money, with a belief that Allah will provide. In order to be sure it was Jack talking, Lane occasionally asked him little bits about his past. In one of the last messages, after the fall of Raqqa, there is the following exchange: Sally: I’ve been so worried. OK, I’ll test you. What was the name of the head of discipline at your school who gave u C3s? Are u OK? Jack: I’m fine, Mr Davis? Sally: Yes Jack: So many people used to give me c3s. What’s new? I’m out by the way. Sally: We’ve been worried sick. Out of the country????? Jack: Out of what they call Isis territories.     Jack Letts is interviewed on ITV News in February. Photograph: ITV/PA    In them, too, in between doctrinal religious quotation, you get a little sense of Jack’s quick wit – if things had taken just a slightly different turn, Sally tells me at one point, she’d imagined Jack would have not been in a war in Syria but on the stage at the Edinburgh fringe with his friends. One of the unspoken subtexts of the court case was the way Jack’s conversion to Islam, when he was 16, seemed to exacerbate his OCD. Did they recognise that link? “He had cognitive behavioural therapy for the OCD when he was younger,” Lane says, “and that seemed to work. But it came back again after he converted. One doctor actually told us that the religion was a useful vehicle for his OCD. With all the praying and washing.” “Some Muslims Jack knew had told him that [the OCD] was the evil spirits of the djinn that had been sent to test him – a load of crap – and that the solution was to wash more, pray more,” John says. “He was getting up at two o’clock in the morning and praying, and washing, so he never slept more than a couple of hours. He started to fall asleep in class – A-levels became impossible.” Alongside those habits they concede that Jack developed an obsessive “search for the truth”. He read everything he could find about Islam and about what a perfect Muslim was. “He had this massive grammar book of Arabic that he would carry everywhere with him,” Lane says. “He took it to America on holiday with him.” “All OCD is about fear, if you don’t go through the rituals then something bad will happen,” Letts says. “In Islam that becomes, if you don’t [live according to the religion] you are going to burn in hell. He was obsessed with not doing something wrong. That is why he wanted to learn Arabic so he could be the best Muslim he could be.” It is also, it appears, one reason why he ended up in Islamic State, to test those abstract notions against reality. His parents want to believe he was quite quickly disillusioned. They admit that they do not know what Jack was doing in Syria for several months. But when he reconnected with them in early 2016 he was, according to their reading of his often cryptic messages, holed up in friends’ houses in Raqqa, dodging Russian bombardment, nursing a shrapnel wound. Their faith in him still being who he was is what sustains them, really. Is it possible for them, I ask, to entertain the idea that he had been brainwashed, targeted by people who might seek to radicalise him? “What you are saying is: are we in denial about him?” Letts says. “That is what everyone is throwing at us…”     The Letts family on holiday in Snowdonia, with Jack, aged 12, on the right, and his younger brother Tyler on the left. Photograph: Courtesy of Sally Lane &amp; John Letts/Courtesy of John Letts    I say I can only imagine the difficulty of wrestling with the idea of the boy they loved so much and this different man who is being presented. In January 2015, Jack got married to the daughter of an Iraqi tribal leader and they subsequently had a baby. Was that in character for the boy they knew? “I wasn’t surprised he got married,” Letts says. “Though I was disappointed not to have been at his wedding. He shows me a message in Arabic Jack tried to send to his wife through the Red Cross, a love letter: ‘I tried to get to you and little Mo in Mosul three times and I couldn’t get through – Isis were going to kill me. I will never stop trying to find you even if it takes 40 years.’” Lane says she thinks of the apparent ease of Jack’s integration into Sunni Iraqi society in terms of a family holiday they had in Morocco when he was 17. “Jack just had dinner with a different set of people each night. He’d get talking to people and they would invite him back to their house. That is the way he was.” The prosecution took close account of one email that John sent to a friend, soon after they first heard the devastating news that Jack was in Syria. “I’ve lost him,” Letts wrote. “I feel terrified, betrayed by Jack, embarrassed, massively let down. I know he’s not a nasty boy. But he’s very stupid and I created him, with my armchair revolutionary shite.” What did he mean by that? “I was in shock and fearing the worst,” Letts says, “and feeling guilty that I had raised him to support the underdog.” He points to the fact that in the past he had been involved in campaigning about East Timor, for example, to the extent that they had Timorese activists living in the spare room. “I wouldn’t call myself a radical lefty as some people are doing. But certainly Jack was raised to question oppression and imperialism. We took him on the Iraq war march and all this kind of stuff. And at that moment [when I first heard he was in Syria] I was thinking, ‘Am I reaping what I sowed?’ That’s all.” If they are guilty of anything, it seems to me, it is of a style of parenting determined to respect above all the individuality of their teenage son, his right to be intellectually curious, to pursue “grand adventures”. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but is that something they recognise?     John Letts and Sally Lane demonstrate outside St Paul’s, October 2017. Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA    I have two regrets,” Letts says. “One is that when he converted to Islam I didn’t walk with him on that path, by being more attentive to what he was doing. But, you know, my business was going under and I was trying to farm and for a time I maybe didn’t give him the time I should have. He saw me probably as this atheist dad who had arguments with him and I maybe should have backed up and said, you know, just ‘that’s interesting, son’. And the second is that I think now his OCD was worse than we ever addressed. It was hard to get help for him when he was a child, and once he had become an adult there was little we could do. Those are my two regrets. But I honestly can’t say I was worried when he left…” “You have to remember,” Lane says, “he was going to Jordan with his mates…” While the legal battles have been front and centre, Lane and Letts’s lives have fractured in other ways. A few good friends have stood by them but inevitable strains show between them as a couple. Their younger son, Tyler, 21, has been away at university for much of the ordeal, though his AS-level revision was thrown off course when the police seized a computer containing all his notes. The time consumed by the legal battle has left Letts and Lane in “a deep financial hole”. After Letts shared the painstaking results of his research, the movement he pioneered in heritage grains has picked up momentum without him. Lane has had to move from job to job, having been asked to leave several when colleagues discovered she was a “terrorist suspect”. On the morning that their trial began, they received a bailiff’s letter to say their remaining possessions would be taken away. It seems a bit hopeless to ask them about hope, but I wonder if they can, with the trial over, think of getting their lives back on track? “Not until Jack is safe,” Lane says. “I hope that is not long. There was an Italian handed over to the Italian government last week…” As a mother she says there’s nothing she can enjoy until then; the baking summer afternoon outside is just a reminder of the heat in her son’s prison. “Jack has become the most politicised figure of any of the detainees,” Letts says. “Obviously [the authorities] would probably most like him to ‘fall down the stairs’. But we are not going to go away. I am hoping if we raise enough pressure, he becomes such a pain in the ass for everyone that they will hand him over too.” They are, despite everything, Letts suggests, placing their faith in British – or Canadian – values: “The rule of law, innocent until proven guilty, the rights of the individual…” That, and their stubborn love for their son."
185,terror,Why 1917 should win the best picture Oscar,"Ever since All Quiet on the Western Front, the least we’ve come to expect from a war-is-hell actioner is grungy realism. Yet in Sam Mendes’s 1917, the trenches are dry, wide and handsomely constructed. Uniforms look fresh out of Brooks Brothers. Even the rats seem pet-shop friendly. The flatlands of Flanders improbably furnish rapids and a plunging cataract, while corpse-strewn, shell-ravaged battlefields quickly give way to flower-strewn meadows. The incineration of a town becomes an alluring firework display. This unconvincing backdrop foregrounds cardboard cutout protagonists devoid of backstory or interiority. Minor roles are cliched caricatures, peppered with pointlessly distracting star cameos. Wooden dialogue limits the scope for acting prowess. A bald, subplot-less storyline embraces both sentimentality and implausibility, as our hero-in-a-hurry takes time out to succour an abandoned baby with milk he happens to have picked up on the way, and skips across no man’s land miraculously immune to shot and shell.   Related: 1917 review – Sam Mendes turns western front horror into a single-shot masterpiece    In an exceptional year featuring masterworks from Tarantino and Scorsese, and the brilliance of Parasite and Marriage Story, who would imagine that a standard man-with-a-mission war film like this might snag that best picture Oscar? Well, the bookies certainly do, placing 1917 way in front of the competition. The film has already picked up best drama at the Golden Globes; since 2000, seven winners of that prize have gone on to take the Oscar. Even more auspiciously, it’s made best picture at the PGA awards, the most reliable predictors of Academy gold, with 13 of their post-millennium alumni copping the big one. How come? 1917 owes everything to what unkind folks might call a gimmick. But this isn’t an awkward contrivance like the digital de-aging in The Irishman – a fancy bolt-on that sort of works and sort of doesn’t. Mendes has bet the farm on an all-encompassing technical feat that’s so successful it singlehandedly makes his film an unmatchable cinematic achievement. Famously, 1917 is shot with the camera following the hero, George MacKay’s Lance Corporal Will Schofield; we see the world as he sees it, for almost all of a relentless Ghent-to-Aix odyssey, in what gives the appearance of a single take.     A wooden war film with distracting star cameos or a piece of cinematic history? ... Benedict Cumberbatch in 1917. Photograph: François Duhamel/Universal Studios    This isn’t an original idea. Only five years ago, Alejandro González Iñárritu’s Birdman won best picture by telling the story of an action hero’s attempt at a Broadway comeback in what appeared to be real time. Back in 1948, Hitchcock hid the cuts in Rope by panning past clothing or furniture. Max Ophüls and Vincente Minnelli tried similar tricks. Godard’s Weekend featured a real-time, seven-minute traffic jam, while protracted opening takes adorn both Altman’s The Player and Cuarón’s Gravity. Yet 1917 is different. Hitchcock needed to paper over his edits because 35mm film magazines had to be changed every 10 minutes. Digital cinematography knows no such limits. Thus, Alexander Sokurov was able to shoot his Russian Ark in 2002 in an uninterrupted, 96-minute wander through the Hermitage museum. Obviously, that degree of continuity would have been unattainable in the fast-changing location of complex-action war film, but developments in post-production now enable film-makers to stitch together long takes into an apparently seamless whole. In 1917, these technical opportunities are exploited as never before. Schofield’s assignment is simply to deliver a message calling off an attack that is going to be ambushed. Yet as we accompany him, dodging bullets and wading through corpses, sharing experiences including the bizarre fate of his fellow messenger, feeling his terror, exhilaration and despair, we gain a more intense appreciation of the horror of war than anything cinema has previously managed. The film’s various eccentricities and deficiencies pale into insignificance as its singular modus operandi grips you by the throat. Schofield has been compared to a computer-game avatar. There’s something in that, but this is an avatar made of flesh and blood, who feels and breathes. Once you’ve seen this film, you won’t forget it. You can’t necessarily say that of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which seems to be 1917’s main competitor for the top slot. Gorgeous and satisfying though Tarantino’s film is, it doesn’t quite make cinema history. 1917 does. And that’s why it deserves the statuette."
186,terror,Usman Khan was freed. Then he went on a killing spree. How did this happen?,"That Usman Khan killed two people having been released from prison under licence for terrorist offences has raised a flurry of urgent questions concerning public safety and prisoner supervision. The most pressing is why Khan, who was jailed in 2012 for his part in an al-Qaida-inspired plot to bomb high-profile locations and build a terrorist training camp in Pakistan, was freed in the first place. Khan, along with two other men from Stoke-on-Trent and several from London and Cardiff, was accused of targeting the London Stock Exchange, the Houses of Parliament and the US embassy, as well as several religious and political figures. But Khan, then 20, admitted to a lesser charge – engaging in conduct for the preparation of terrorism. The court heard that he had been secretly recorded talking about plans to recruit UK radicals to attend a training camp in Kashmir. Along with another man, he was given an indeterminate public protection sentence (IPP) and was told that he would serve at least eight years in prison. Passing sentence, judge Mr Justice Wilkie said Khan and others had been involved in a “serious, long-term venture in terrorism” that could also have resulted in atrocities being carried out in Britain. “It was envisaged by them all that ultimately they and the other recruits may return to the UK as trained and experienced terrorists available to perform terrorist attacks in this country,” he said. But the IPP sentence, which ends only when the Parole Board considers that an offender no longer poses a risk to the public, was quashed by the Court of Appeal in 2013. At the time many politicians and penal reform campaigners feared such sentences were resulting in prisoners unjustly spending too long in jail, and they were being abolished. At his appeal Khan’s legal team claimed that he was a young man whose ambition was to bring sharia law to Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and that it was “highly unrealistic to suppose that the authorities in Pakistan would allow a teenager from Stoke to impose sharia law or run a training school for terrorists”. One of the appeal judges, Lord Justice Leveson, acknowledged that there was “no doubt that anyone convicted of this type of offence could legitimately be considered dangerous” but replaced Khan’s IPP sentence with a 16-year determinate sentence. Prisoners are usually released halfway through such sentences, but Khan had served less than seven years when he was freed on licence in December last year and ordered to wear a tag. His time spent in custody before he was sentenced would have been taken into account, according to legal experts. In the aftermath of the tragedy, politicians on all sides have claimed that the sentencing and supervision regime applied to terrorists needs revisiting. Boris Johnson said it was important to “enforce the appropriate sentences for dangerous criminals, especially for terrorists”. Security minister Brandon Lewis said: “I think it is right that we do have to look again at the sentences … around these violent crimes.” Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he, too, was concerned that IPP sentences had been scrapped, and also raised the issue of people being released on licence. “Does the Ministry of Justice, does the probation service have the powers and resources to properly supervise people who are clearly dangerous?” Khan asked. However, Richard Garside, director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, cautioned against a kneejerk reaction from politicians. “The IPP sentence was abolished because many low- and no-risk people were left languishing in prison, sometimes for years. The pursuit of total security will only ever result in multiple injustices. We need to learn the lessons from any failings of supervision in this particular case, and do a lot more to address the causes of extremism.” Chris Phillips, a former head of the UK National Counter Terrorism Security Office, warned that convicted terrorists were being released when still radicalised. “We’re playing Russian roulette with people’s lives, letting convicted, known, radicalised jihadi criminals walk about our streets,” Phillips said.     Police set up screens outside a property in Stafford that is being searched following the stabbings in London. Photograph: Jacob King/PA    The Observer understands that although Khan was not considered high risk, he was seen by probation twice a week. There was nothing in his pattern of behaviour prior to the attacks that suggested his risk profile had changed. As is mandatory for convicted terrorists, he was on the government’s Desistance and Disengagement deradicalisation programme and was attending a conference on prisoner rehabilitation, organised by the University of Cambridge, when he is alleged to have stabbed two people to death. The conference, held at London’s Fishmongers’ Hall, was to celebrate five years of the Learning Together initiative, and was an invitation-only event. Founded by two academics, Drs Amy Ludlow and Ruth Armstrong, the initiative has been widely praised by penal reformers. “They wanted to get academics out of ivory towers,” said one justice campaigner who asked not to be named. “They wanted prisoners and criminologists to sit together in the classroom and learn together.” An American idea, it has now spread across the UK, with many prisons teaming up with universities. “It would be a tragedy if what has happened has an impact on the initiative,” the campaigner said. “Maybe 98% of those who attend benefit from it. Remember, some of those who chased him down were ex-offenders who’d been at the same conference.” Why Khan appears to have been beyond rehabilitation will now be the subject of intense scrutiny. His radicalism dates back to at least 2006 when he would engage in street activism, preaching against homosexuality. In 2008 his Staffordshire home was raided by police who suspected him of trying to brainwash vulnerable members of his community. His views, it seems, were deep and stubborn.

187,terror,Finsbury Park mosque worshippers shocked by New Zealand terror attack,"There was a feeling of shock, concern but also defiance among Muslims as they gathered for Friday prayers at one of Britain’s largest mosques, hours after a terrorist attack on worshippers in Christchurch, New Zealand left 49 dead. In a terrorist attack in June 2017 Darren Osborne drove into a crowd of worshippers standing on a pavement near Finsbury Park mosque, killing Makram Ali and injuring nine others. There was a sombre mood inside the building in north London on Friday, after it was revealed that the Christchurch suspect’s manifesto cited a list including the name “Darren Osbourne”. Locals laid bouquets and cards to remember the victims. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and Islington council leader, Richard Watts, visited the mosque after Friday’s prayers to give their condolences. Opinion was divided on whether police and security guards were needed inside mosques after the terrorist attack in New Zealand, with some admitting they were worried for their safety. A handful of police officers stood outside the gates as people arrived for the afternoon prayers. Benyounes Msaad, who has lived in the area for 40 years, said: “It’s a very sad day, it’s inhumane taking innocent people. We should have security inside the mosque, it could be anyone coming in. “We don’t discriminate against other religions so anyone can come in. These days you don’t know who they could be, [maybe] having security guards. “When I saw the video of the attack it was depressing, I wish I didn’t see it. A lot of people probably didn’t come today. I have been keeping an eye out. I hope things are not going to get worse. We want peace.” Another worshipper, Ahmed, said: “It has never happened here, this is something new. It’s a good idea having police officers here. There is extremism everywhere, trying to divide people, creating problems. We have to show peace, love and react positively. “Prophet Muhammad said the community is like one body, if one part is feeling pain, then the rest feel pain.” The attack in Christchurch was the first issue discussed in the sermon by Shaykh Faid Said, who sent a message to New Zealand’s Muslim community to “be strong and be united”. He added that Muslims were “a resilient community” and would not “change their way of life” by cowering to extremists. A special prayer service was held in Finsbury Park to remember the 49 victims of the Christchurch attack, who were killed while they attended Friday prayers. Islam Khan said: “The mosque has security cameras but I don’t feel completely safe in any mosque as anyone can come in and out. “They should have uniformed security at the front of every mosque.” Hanna, a finance worker, said mosques should consider employing security guards. She added: “First it was the Finsbury Park attack and now New Zealand. With the rise in Islamophobia it is important for the Muslim community to feel safe. “Security measures are called for, especially during busy times like Friday prayers, Eid prayers, Ramadan. These attacks have shaken the community and some may be afraid to attend the mosque. It’s sad because no one should feel unsafe in their place of worship.” But some worshippers insisted that they felt safe attending their local mosque. Anas Tezene, an asylum seeker from Syria, said: “People are kind here, it is not dangerous. I feel safe. The society here is welcoming for refugees and immigrants.” Some Muslims in the area felt there were more deep-rooted problems that needed to be addressed in order to prevent future terrorist atrocities. Faisal El Hussein, a Canadian who is on holiday in London, said: “This stems from hate brewing up for a long time. It’s gradual. “You need to catch it at the root. Exposing people to different cultures when they’re young. Have more intercultural interaction. I’m from Toronto and grew up around difficult cultures. “It’s OK to have friends from your own culture but you have to mingle.”   Related: The Islamophobia that led to the Christchurch shooting must be confronted | HA Hellyer    Hashim Mohammed said along with more security inside mosques, the key was to “unite Muslims and non-Muslims to love each other and to mix”. He added: “Imams and [other faith leaders] should meet all of the time and communicate. It’s about learning from the experiences of the past.” Watts, addressing worshippers after the prayers, described the events in Christchurch as an appalling attack. He said: “I am proud to be your friend and neighbour and look forward to working with you all. We stand with you.

188,terror,Trump blames Iran for oil tanker attacks and calls country a 'nation of terror',"Donald Trump has blamed Iran for recent attacks on two oil tankers near the strategic Strait of Hormuz, describing the country is a “nation of terror”. 
Speaking with Fox News on Friday, the president rejected Tehran’s denials that it was involved in the attacks and cited a video released by US Central Command late Thursday purporting to show an Iranian vessel removing an unexploded mine from one of the tankers.

“Iran did do it and you know they did it because you saw the boat,” Trump said. “They’re in deep, deep trouble.” 
“We don’t take it lightly,” he added, pointing out the US had already reimposed tough sanctions on Iran. 
“They’ve been told in very strong terms … we want to get them back to the table if they want to get back. I’m in no rush.” 
Trump’s comments came during a wide-ranging interview with Fox &amp; Friends on his 73rd birthday. 
Hours before Trump’s interview aired, Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said the US was making allegations without “a shred of factual or circumstantial evidence” and accused the Trump administration of “sabotage diplomacy”. 
Trump’s appearance on Fox &amp; Friends came as he capped off yet another week mired in controversy. 
Trump ignited a firestorm on Wednesday by stating he would listen if a foreign government approached his campaign with damaging information about a political opponent. Trump also said he wouldn’t necessarily alert the FBI, despite the widespread consensus that his campaign should have reported offers of Russian assistance in 2016 to federal authorities. 
Trump attempted to clarify his comments on Friday, telling Fox &amp; Friends: “If I thought anything was incorrect or badly stated, I’d report it to the attorney general, the FBI, I’d report it to law enforcement, absolutely. 
“Of course you’d do that, you couldn’t have that happen with our country,” he said. 
At the same time, Trump said he would still look at what information a foreign government was sharing, “because if you don’t look at it, you’re not going to know if it’s bad”. 
Trump also stood by his senior counselor Kellyanne Conway after a US government watchdog recommended she be removed from office for repeatedly violating a law that limits political activity for government employees. 
“I’m not gonna fire her. I think she’s a terrific person. She’s a tremendous spokesperson,” Trump said. “It looks to me like they’re trying to take away her right of free speech.” 
The US Office of Special Counsel released a report on Thursday stating Conway had violated the Hatch Act on several occasions by disparaging 2020 Democratic candidates while acting in her capacity as a White House official. Conway had sparked similar ethics concerns by wading into the 2017 Alabama Senate election, the investigators said. 
“Ms Conway’s violations, if left unpunished, would send a message to all federal employees that they need not abide by the Hatch Act’s restrictions,” the report said. “Her actions thus erode the principal foundation of our democratic system – the rule of law.” 
Trump denied Conway was in the wrong, telling Fox &amp; Friends: “It doesn’t work that way.” 
“A person wouldn’t be able to express themselves, and I just don’t see it,” he added."
189,terror,'I'm seeing ghosts': Pats terrorize Darnold and Jets in Monday night massacre,"The New England Patriots moved to 7-0 for the season as their outstanding defense harried the New York Jets all night in a 33-0 win on Monday.   Related: Six TDs and 429 yards in one game. Let's check whether Aaron Rodgers is past it    At one point in the first-half, after he had thrown two interceptions and given away a fumble under intense pressure from the Pats defense, a shaken Sam Darnold was picked up by the microphone saying “I’m seeing ghosts”. Things did not get much better for the Jets quarterback: he ended up with four interceptions for the evening. Although New England caused him plenty of problems he was also guilty of some terrible throws with two going straight to Patriot defensive backs. He ended with just 86 yards through the air and completed only 11 of 32 passes, giving him a quarterback rating of 3.7.    Oh no Sam Darnold do not admit to &quot;seeing ghosts&quot; when you&#39;re mic&#39;d up in prime time. pic.twitter.com/E0pukwhL4s&mdash; Will Brinson (@WillBrinson) October 22, 2019    Bradford explained his sideline comments to reporters after the game. “I just gotta see the field a lot better,” Darnold said. “That’s kinda what that means. It was a rough day out there, rough night out there, and obviously I gotta be better and learn from the mistakes. But we will get better.” Patriots linebacker Kyle Van Noy was amused when informed of Darnold’s comments. Ooh, man, that’s the boogie man,” he said. “That’s crazy for him to say that. That makes it real, you know what I’m saying? ... I think it’s just a testament to how well we’re playing, to be honest. And we played really well tonight.” The reigning Super Bowl champion Patriots now have the best record in the AFC. The win was also their largest ever shutout victory against their divisional rivals. Tom Brady did not have a vintage night, throwing for one touchdown, one interception and 249 yards, but it was more than enough to beat a woeful Jets team. Sony Michel had three rushing touchdowns for the Patriots."
190,terror,Trump administration to designate Iran’s Revolutionary Guards a terror group – report,"The Trump administration is reportedly planning to designate Iran’s Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation, in an unprecedented step aimed at escalating Washington’s campaign of “maximum pressure”. According to the Wall Street Journal, the administration is preparing to announce the move as early as Monday. It would mark the first time the US has designated a branch of the armed forces of a foreign government as a terrorist group. The US state department declined to comment on the report on Friday evening. Experts said it was unclear how much concrete difference the terrorist designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) would make. It is already heavily sanctioned by the US as a terrorist supporter, and Iran is designated a state sponsor of terrorism. “It is hard to imagine a bigger sanctions stick than that,” said Richard Nephew, a former principal deputy coordinator for sanctions policy at the state department, and the author of The Art of Sanctions. “Frankly, I still don’t believe that this is consistent with the intent of the underlying law, which was to target non-state actors.”   Related: Trump wants to keep US troops in Iraq to 'be able to watch' Iran    The move, if carried out, is likely to increase the trepidation on the part of foreign companies when it comes to trading with or investing in Iran. The IRGC controls a large slice of the Iranian economy (the Trump administration claims up to half), and the US treasury and state department have stressed that the onus is on foreign companies to find out if the partners they deal with in Iran are tied to sanctioned groups. “This is uncharted territory. We haven’t done this before,” said Ariane Tabatabai, an Iran expert at the Rand Corporation. “It is a sign the US is prepared to fully escalate ‘maximum pressure’ but what is lacking is a clear endgame. There is a confusion of means and ends. The administration sees the damage inflicted as success. But that’s not how it works. “The IRGC has always thrived under pressure,” Tabatabai, the coauthor of a book on Iranian foreign policy, Triple Axis: Iran’s Relations with Russia and China, added. The Wall Street Journal report said that senior Pentagon officials were apprehensive about the move, fearing it could provoke a backlash against US troops in the region. Mohammad Ali Shabani, an Iran scholar at Soas University of London, said that if the designation is announced, the Iranian government is likely to respond in kind.   Related: US will expel every last Iranian boot from Syria, says Mike Pompeo    “First and foremost, the Iranian parliament may move to label the US military a terrorist organization,” Shabani said, but he added he thought the Iranian military would avoid being drawn into a direct clash with US forces in the region. He argued that it marked an attempt by Iran hawks in the administration, like the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and the national security adviser, John Bolton, to box in future decision making on Iran. “The point of all of this is to constrain Trump’s deal-making instinct as much as possible and make it as difficult as possible for the next US president to return to sanity on Iran.”"
191,terror,Mother A: returned Isis extremist subject to secretive counter-terror scheme,"Mother A was enrolled in the government’s clandestine desistance and disengagement programme (DDP) after returning to the UK from Isis-held territory in Syria with a 10-month-old baby in her arms. Her story is revealed in court records, uncovered by the Guardian, that offer a glimpse at who is subject to the DDP, why they are enrolled and what – in part – the programme entails. A sport-loving teenager with an active social life, the woman suddenly became devout and pious after leaving school and – through a family connection and well-known member of a banned extremist group – was married to a jihadist with whom she would travel to the heart of Islamic State. After more than two years in Iraq, Syria and Turkey, she returned with her daughter to the UK in late 2017 where she was arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences – but no prosecution was pursued.   Related: Extremists living in UK under secretive counter-terror programme    She was, however, subject to family court proceedings when the local authority applied to place her daughter, now two-years-old, into care. And those court documents reveal that around March last year, she was enrolled in the DDP and had been meeting with an “intervention provider”. Little is known about the programme due to the sensitive national security space it occupies but the Guardian has revealed that at least 116 convicted and suspected terrorists are engaged. The mother had completed six sessions of work with a DDP therapist, of which the first three concerned themselves with her anxieties about accommodation, the court process and the parenting assessment rather than matters of substance, according to a court judgement handed down in June last year. Mother A, as she is referred to in the court records, accepted the local authority was right to be concerned about her radicalisation and she acknowledged to the therapist that she had been radicalised prior to travelling to Syria. She was keen to be a good role model for her daughter and keen to have an ongoing relationship with her, the records said, and during a session in May last year, the mother told the therapist that her husband had suggested while they were on honeymoon that they should travel to Syria in order to live there. During another session, which took place by telephone, the mother told the therapist that she knew from the start – that is from the time that she was in the UK – that her husband wanted to travel to Syria. In a session in June last year, Mother A told her therapist that she understood she was extreme in her beliefs but said that she did not think she would have done anything to harm anyone at that time. She stressed that, having done some personal research, she no longer believed in Isis and what it stood for, the records said. The therapist formed the view that the mother was very vulnerable since she had a “limited understanding of her faith and needed support with developing her theological and political critical thinking skills”. The British-born woman, now in her early 20s and a Muslim, left school at 16 and went to college to study, before working in retail and also as a receptionist. In 2014, she volunteered to care for a grandparent who had significant health problems. She would help them wash and dress, to move around and would keep them company. Caring for her grandparent appears to have coincided with her increasing religious devotion. She started wearing a veil and began to practice segregation within the family home – that is the separation of men and women whenever anyone outside the immediate family was present. “The lack of contact outside the family home was, I find, part and parcel of the mother’s adoption of strict behaviours/practices to demonstrate her faith,” the judge, Justice Gwynneth Knowles, said. By early 2015, Mother A’s Twitter account showed an interest in Isis with evidence that she was aware of the terrorist group’s declaration of a caliphate and the extremist mindset of its members. Her Twitter banner was a picture of a number of woman, several of whom were carrying the Isis black flag. In January 2015, she tweeted “Muslim or non-Muslim the khilafah will rule over everyone“. Another tweet on 8 January 2015, the day after the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris, stated in reaction to a Sky News report: “put a leash on your mouths &amp; actions. You can’t attack Muslims in all [angles] nd expect to get away with it. A Muslim will retaliate.” She said Charlie Hebdo was responsible for the deaths at the magazine’s offices, and not those who carried out the killings. It was around this time that Mother A met her future husband after she was given his phone number by a woman over Twitter. The man, in his early 20s, was a British national raised as a Christian, who later converted to Islam. Prior to his departure to Syria he lived with his parents and sister in England. He had been radicalised and held Islamist extremist beliefs and wanted to travel to Syria to fight for Isis and to engage in terrorism-related activity. But the court documents reveal that the marriage was “brokered” by the mother’s brother-in-law, her elder sister’s husband, referred to as Z, who is a member of the banned Islamist group al-Muhajiroun. The brother-in-law met with the prospective husband in January 2015 and two months later, the young woman married the man in an Islamic ceremony – apparently without the knowledge of either of their families. The judge in the family court case concluded that the marriage was arranged to facilitate the husband’s travel to Syria, as part of his plan to fight for Isis and live in the so-called “caliphate”. Shortly after they married, Mother A and her husband were given a lift to Gatwick, dressed in “western style” clothes and left the country on an easyJet flight, for which her husband had booked return flights. After a few days abroad, the couple travelled to Turkey, and from Turkey travelled to Syria by road into Isis-controlled territory. Shortly after, they went to Mosul, in Iraq, where they remained for several months before travelling to Raqqa in Syria, the de facto Isis capital, where they remained for eight months. After moving to a town near the Turkish border, the woman gave birth to her daughter. The couple eventually presented themselves to Turkish authorities, where they were held in a detention camp. As of June last year, the father was imprisoned overseas on terrorism-related charges. At the time of the judgment being published, Mother A was living in local authority-provided bed and breakfast accommodation. The judge found there was a risk she would radicalise her daughter and could seek to take her to an unsafe location in pursuit of extremism. The daughter was taken from her care."
192,terror,"Threat from extreme rightwing terrorism in Australia has increased, Asio says","The threat from extreme rightwing terrorism in Australia has increased in recent years and will remain an “enduring threat”, according to Australia’s spy agency. The Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation issued the warning in its latest annual report, adding that “extreme rightwing groups in Australia are more cohesive and organised than they have been in previous years”. The comments amp up the agency’s concern about rightwing extremist terrorism, after Asio boss Duncan Lewis told Senate estimates in April it was an important issue but the Christchurch massacre had not changed the agency’s calculus. The massacre of 49 people at two mosques in Christchurch, for which 28-year-old Australian Brenton Tarrant has been charged, prompted renewed scrutiny of the far right including by Australia’s home affairs department.   Related: What does Christchurch attack tell us about rightwing extremism?    The Asio report said the national terrorism threat level remained at “probable” because “credible intelligence … indicates an intention and capability to conduct a terrorist attack in Australia”. “The principal source of the terrorist threat remains Sunni Islamist extremism and emanates primarily from small groups and individuals inspired, directed or encouraged by extremist groups overseas,” it said. The report argued that Isis had reduced ability to direct external attack planning due to “sustained losses” but warned the group “continues to inspire attacks globally – including against the west”. The Asio report linked the threat in Australia to the global context, where terrorist attacks are “now an indelible feature of the security environment”. “Terrorists inspired by violent Islamist extremist and rightwing extremist ideologies reinforce their respective narratives by fomenting hatred and inciting violence to realise their ideological objectives,” it said. “The rightwing extremist attacks in Christchurch on 15 March 2019 demonstrate that it takes only a single individual to embrace and act on a violent extremist ideology to have a global impact.” Asio concluded “the threat from the extreme rightwing in Australia has increased in recent years”. “Extreme rightwing groups in Australia are more cohesive and organised than they have been over previous years, and will remain an enduring threat. “Any future extreme rightwing-inspired attack in Australia would most likely be low capability and conducted by a lone actor or small group, although a sophisticated weapons attack is possible.” The Asio report noted that violent protests in Australia were rare and community cohesion was high but “over the next 12 months, acts of opportunistic violence or civil disobedience at protests are possible, particularly those attended by counter-protesters”. The report said since September 2014 there had been seven terrorist attacks in Australia and 16 “major counter-terrorism disruptions”. Concern about the far-right in Australia has increased due to attempts to infiltrate mainstream political parties and mobilisation of white supremacists before the federal election. Australia’s tough gun laws are widely credited with helping to avoid devastating consequences of politically-motivated violence such as the Christchurch massacre, the murder of UK MP Jo Cox or the massacre of 77 people by rightwing extremist Anders Breivik in Norway."
193,terror,Beware terrorists but don't sweat the climate crisis – how blind can Morrison be?,"“Sydney’s burning.” That might be a headline from any Australian media outlet today, given the fires consuming New South Wales (and other states). But it’s actually the title of Ian Turner’s classic account of the suppression by the Australian government of an international labour union, Industrial Workers of the World, in 1916. Turner explains how, in an Australia deeply divided by Billy Hughes’s plans for conscription, a series of suspicious blazes provided pretext for draconian repression, with 12 members of the antiwar IWW imprisoned for, among other offences, “feloniously and wickedly conspire[ing] to burn down and destroy buildings and shops in Sydney and elsewhere in the state”.   Related: Now is the time to read the smoke signals of 2019. Their message of doom is clear | Peter Lewis    The story’s one that resonates in a post-9/11 world. In the last decades, we’ve become accustomed to leaders hyping up supposed threats (most historians consider the charges against the IWW Twelve a crude frame-up) to national security to push through a political agenda that would never be acceptable under normal circumstances. That’s why, with Sydney on fire once more, it’s worth thinking about how governments respond to terrorism, and how they respond to climate change. Imagine if Islamic State or al-Qaeda had conducted an attack equivalent in its effects to the current blazes. If it were terrorists rather than fires responsible for six deaths, the destruction of about 700 homes, and the devastation of 2.7 million hectares, would Scott Morrison have tweeted a picture of himself at the Gabba, cheerily promising terror-impacted communities that “our boys” would give them “something to cheer for”? Obviously not. We know from previous experience that even a relatively minor security incident utterly reshapes the political landscape. A terror attack on the scale of the current emergency would have transformed Australian politics forever. Yet that’s not what happened. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning       The Sydney Morning Herald’s Peter Hartcher recently expressed his bemusement at how little attention was paid during parliamentary question time to the dangerous smoke choking Australian cities. “The politicians talked about a great many things,” he wrote. “But if you watched it on TV, the subtitles were about only one: … a non-stop series of fire alerts … At no point in an hour and a quarter did the politicians discuss the most obvious and pressing concern for most of the people they represent.” As the world’s media noted, Morrison seemed particularly blasé about the whole business, providing no particular advice or consolation for Australians exposed – potentially for months – to polluted air. He did, however, announce that anti-terror police armed with assault rifles would patrol the nation’s airports over Christmas. In 2017, Sydney Morning Herald economics editor Ross Gittins declared that there weren’t “many scams bigger than all the fuss we’re making about the threat of terrorism coming to our shores.” He didn’t mean that terrorism wasn’t real, nor that it represented no threat within Australia. But he pointed out that other dangers that posed immeasurably and demonstrably more risk didn’t receive nearly the same attention. The number of people killed by terrorists on home soil in recent decades remains in single digits whereas, as Gittins says, alcohol kills 15 Australians and hospitalises 430 each and every day. Yet the real (but very slight) threat of domestic terror dominates policy while the real (and very major) consequences of alcohol abuse do not. The same comparison might be made in relation to climate change, an issue inevitably centred on risk.   Related: 'Doing nothing is not a solution': NSW environment minister blames climate crisis for bushfires    “We are on track,” says the UN environment program, “for a temperature rise of over 3C. This would bring mass extinctions and large parts of the planet would be uninhabitable.” That’s a prediction, not a guarantee (though it’s worth noting that a recent survey of peer-reviewed literature has shown that agreement among research scientists on anthropogenic global warming has effectively reached 100%). Yet the same politicians who demand action to prevent the most statistically unlikely (but, of course, still possible) terror outcomes seem determined to ride their luck on climate. Sixteen years ago the report of the inquiry into the 2002-2003 Victorian bushfires warned that “climate change throughout the present century is predicted to lead to increased temperatures and, with them, a heightened risk of unplanned fire” – a finding confirmed by multiple studies ever since. Professor Dale Dominey-Howes from the University of Sydney puts it like this: “Though these bushfires are not directly attributable to climate change, our rapidly warming climate, driven by human activities, is exacerbating every risk factor for more frequent and intense bushfires.” Given the disastrous consequences of fires, consequences we’re now experiencing, why didn’t the identifiable (and repeatedly identified) risk from global warming put environmental action, rather than national security, at the top of the political agenda? Morrison describes climate change as “a global phenomenon” and tells us “we’re doing our bit” to fight it. Anthony Albanese wants higher domestic carbon targets but rejects any suggestion of curtailing coal exports to send a message to other countries. Yet when it comes to the war on terror, those exact arguments go out the window. Back in 2003, John Howard insisted on taking the country to war in Iraq, explicitly stressing the moral necessity of showing support for the efforts of America and Britain. Militarily, Australian troops made little difference to the enormous American force. Politically, George W Bush wanted a developed country to enlist in his ”coalition of the willing” – an alliance including nations such as the Marshall Islands, Palau and Solomon Islands (which didn’t actually have armies).   Related: Scott Morrison and the Coalition are fiddling as Australia burns | Katharine Murphy    “Australia cannot,” said Howard, “purchase security by keeping its head down and leaving others to do all the heavy lifting”. The resulting conflict killed hundreds of thousands of people, devastated the region and cost Australia billions of dollars. The counterfactual is obvious. Imagine where we might be if, back in 2003, Bush and Blair and Howard had formed their coalition, not to destroy non-existent WMDs but to pursue decarbonisation. The best recent estimate suggests that the US devoted $1.06tn  to the Iraq war. It’s a staggering figure, a sum that would have gone a long way to fund a just transition to a sustainable international economy. But our leaders chose instead to launch, in the name of fighting terror, a war of choice in Iraq. The region has been in flames more or less ever since – and now Sydney’s burning too. • Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist"
194,terror,'No right to livestream murder': Ardern leads push against online terror content,"New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern is to spearhead a push to combat violent extremism and terrorism on social media in the wake of the Christchurch attacks, saying the gunman did not have “a right to livestream the murder of 50 people”. 
Ardern and French president Emmanuel Macron will host a summit in Paris on 15 May, rallying tech companies and other concerned countries to commit to a pledge known as the “Christchurch Call” – a vow to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online. 
Ardern said online platforms had been used in a “unique” way to disseminate and publicise video of the Christchurch attack, and there had been rallying cries for New Zealand to take on a leadership role, but the country of fewer than 5 million people could not do it alone. 
France was a natural partner, Ardern said, due to its G7 presidency, focus on combating the use of the internet for terrorist purposes, and being the host country for a G7 digital ministers meeting in mid-May.

“We want to maintain the principles of a free, open and secure internet, but this isn’t about freedom of expression, this is about preventing violent extremism and terrorism online. I don’t think anyone would argue that the terrorist on the 15th of March had a right to livestream the murder of 50 people,” Ardern said on Wednesday. 
“We all need to act, and that includes social media providers taking more responsibility for the content that is on their platforms … it’s critical that technology platforms like Facebook are not perverted as a tool for terrorism, and instead become part of a global solution to countering extremism.” 
Ardern said she had already spoken to global tech company chief executives, including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, and those of Twitter, Microsoft and Google. She described the conversations as “really positive”.  
“No tech company, just like no government, wishes to see violent extremism and terrorism online, so we have a starting point that is one of unity,” said Ardern. 
“What we’re trying to tackle here is a global issue and I think it requires a global response. New Zealand is looking to play a leadership role because what happened here on the 15th of March was unprecedented in the way that is used the internet, so with that does come a responsibility to try and make change.” 
The text of the Christchurch Call to action was still being finalised, Ardern said, but there would be a strong focus on practical action, and not just aspirational rhetoric. 
Ardern said a number of countries such as France, Ireland, New Zealand and Germany already had internet legislation in place, but more needed to be done towards ensuring better global protections, and tech companies had a responsibility to make their platforms safer. 
The Christchurch mosque gunman livestreamed the mosque shootings on Facebook and they were viewed thousands of times before moderators were alerted 30 minutes after the shootings. 
The video of the mosque attack was also copied and shared widely on the internet, and Facebook has said that since the attacks it has intercepted and prevented more than 1m attempts to upload and distribute the video again. 
The New Zealand government announced on Wednesday that it would offer all victims of the Christchurch mosque shootings permanent residency in the country, an offer that extends to their immediate family members, and which they have two years to take up."
195,terror,"Fastest-growing UK terrorist threat is from far right, say police","Police have vowed to thwart the rise of the far right, which they have said is the fastest-growing terrorist threat in the UK, as they try to stop race hate ideologues from bringing violence to the country’s streets. Britain’s top counter-terrorism officer, the Met assistant commissioner, Neil Basu, said the most likely attempts would come from “lone actors” and, as with Islamist terrorism, the authorities could not guarantee to foil every plot. The Guardian understands that investigators have found links on far-right material on legitimate platforms such as YouTube that allow people to find more extremist propaganda. Police said they and MI5, which since 2018 has taken the lead on the most serious extreme rightwing plots, were carrying out 80 investigations to stop violence fuelled by ideologies such as white supremacism and Islamophobia. In their first public briefing since far-right terrorists murdered the Labour MP Jo Cox in 2016 and murdered a Muslim worshipper near a north London mosque in 2017, police revealed:  A quarter of all terrorism arrests in the past year were linked to far-right violence. The far-right caseload of counter-terrorism police jumped from 6% to 10% in the last two years. Referrals to Prevent, the anti-radicalisation programme, had almost doubled between 2016 and 2018 for the far right, from 10% to 18%, and were expected to rise further.  A third of all terror plots to kill in Britain since 2017 – seven out of 22 – were by those driven by extreme-right causes.  Basu said police were battling to stop extreme rightwing terrorism gaining more of a foothold than it already had. “The problem is small but it is my fastest-growing problem,” he said. The growth from 2016 to 2018 came in the period following the vote to leave the EU, which also coincided with a rise in hate crime. Basu said there was “clearly a correlation” between the rise in hate crime and far-right activity, but said he could not say the link was “causal” and that the far-right threat had been present long beforehand.   Related: Faces of far-right terror: four cases of foiled plots    Most of the plotting took place online, police said, with links overseas to extreme-right followers elsewhere in Europe, in the US and South America, swapping information and messages of encouragement. Police said some of the rightwing extremist plotters had acquired and were using manuals on killing drawn up by Islamic State. The ideologies that could trigger violence, police said, included those of cultural nationalists, and of legal groups such as the English Defence League and allied organisations, which publicly abhor violence. The ideology of white supremacists, such as the now-banned National Action and groups such as Sonnenkrieg Division and System Resistance Network, was also a major potential trigger of far-right violence, they said. Police also revealed that some on the violent extreme right were followers of satanism as they tried to illustrate the bizarre ideological morass they were trying to navigate. Some caught up in trying to kill in the name of white supremacism were as young as 14, police said. For years, members of Muslim communities, researchers on neo-Nazism and others have claimed that the authorities have been too slow to realise the dangers of rightwing extremism, and Basu said: “Some of the criticism that we did not look at white supremacist rightwing violence as terrorism is probably justified criticism.”  He added: “When nearly a third of plots foiled by police and security services relate to rightwing ideology, it lays bare why we are taking this threat so seriously.” The remainder were jihadist, which remains by far the biggest terrorist threat to the UK and has stabilised at a very high level after years of growth. Last year MI5 took the lead in investigating the most dangerous extreme rightwing terrorists, in a sign of how seriously the threat was being taken. Some terrorists were incited by extreme-right propaganda, such as Thomas Mair, who murdered Cox in 2016. But others, such as Darren Osborne, who attacked Muslim worshippers with a van in north London, had acted after consuming lawful material from groups such as the English Defence League and mainstream media. Nick Lowles, the chief executive of the Hope Not Hate charity, said: “We have long warned about the rising threat from the far right. Small groups of hardcore Nazis are increasingly willing to commit extreme acts of violence, while a wider pool of DIY fascists are engaging in campaigns of harassment against public figures, especially those who oppose Brexit. “It is essential that the police track the most extremist groups, but it is also vital to have robust security arrangements for candidates in any forthcoming election.” Weapons involved in plots, or which rightwing terrorists have sought to obtain, included knives, explosives and firearms. Basu said National Action – the only far-right group banned under proscription powers in the UK – had been “decimated”, with only small groups or individuals still operating online across international borders. He added: “We are bringing the full might of the UK counter-terrorism machine to bear against those extremists of any ideology who wish to do us harm or incite violence. And that is evident not only in the number of plots we have foiled, but also the number of convictions we have achieved and continue to chase through the courts.” He called on individuals outside law enforcement to aid the fight against far-right extremism, adding that police “can’t arrest ourselves out of this problem”. He said: “That includes fighting against intolerance and hatred where we see it, and the insidious rise of hateful rhetoric online that goes beyond free speech and crosses into criminality must be fought at every opportunity.” Basu championed Prevent, now the subject of an independent review. The controversy surrounding the programme has centred on the impact it has had on Muslim communities. But in 2017-18, of the 7,318 individuals referred to the scheme, 1,312 were referred for concerns related to rightwing extremism, a rise of a third when compared with the previous year."
196,terror,Guaidó says Maduro is 'sowing terror' against leaders who tried to oust him,"The Venezuelan politician fighting to depose Nicolás Maduro has accused his rival of attempting to obliterate the opposition challenge to his rule with a campaign of “state terrorism”. Speaking to the Guardian nearly two weeks after his failed uprising against Maduro, Juan Guaidó claimed Venezuela’s strongman president was illegally targeting opposition leaders who took part. At least 10 Guaidó allies are facing years in jail for their role in the abortive 30 April insurrection – with three seeking refuge in diplomatic compounds and one fleeing to Colombia in recent days. The current location of Edgar Zambrano, the vice-president of Venezuela’s opposition-controlled parliament, is unknown after he was seized by intelligence agents last Wednesday. “Today what we are seeing is terror, the sowing of terror, which is all the Maduro regime has left,” Guaidó said during an interview at his party headquarters in Caracas. “What they are doing right now is basically state terrorism – because they are using the state apparatus to spread fear.” Venezuela’s foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, has rejected international criticism of his government’s clampdown, asking critics how they would respond to a similarly “foolhardy operation” to remove their leader. Maduro and his backers describe the botched mutiny as a US-backed coup attempt that was defeated thanks to the loyalty of Venezuela’s armed forces. But Guaidó, the 35-year-old president of Venezuela’s national assembly, claimed Maduro’s pursuit of opposition lawmakers reflected the desperation of a regime “in its final moments”. “All that he has left, regrettably, is persecution,” Guaidó said of Maduro, who took power after Hugo Chávez’s 2013 death and was returned to office last year in elections widely denounced as a fraud. Several key Maduro confidants were reportedly involved in the plot against him – including the defence minister and the head of the supreme court – and Guaidó said he believed Maduro was now racked with paranoia. “I think he mistrusts everyone … even the person who serves him coffee.” He called the defection of Venezuela’s top spy – who Maduro has accused of being a CIA mole – proof of a deep split within the military and predicted: “There will be more and more [defections].” Despite the recent upheaval, Guaidó cut a confident and carefree figure during the half-hour interview, at one point spontaneously breaking into a falsetto rendition of his campaign jingle: “Vamos bien!” (“We’re doing good!”). As the Guardian left his office, Guaidó beamed and flashed a V sign with his left hand. But for all that outward bounce the politician’s life has been upended since he launched his campaign against Maduro in January by declaring himself Venezuela’s rightful interim president – a decision now endorsed by 54 governments, including the US and Britain. Thickset security guards prowl the corridors of his offices with walkie talkies strapped to their hips. Guaidó’s wife and baby daughter have reportedly left Venezuela. “There have been lots of threats,” he said, calling recent days “very complicated”. Guaidó has yet to be detained or charged – something many attribute to Maduro’s reluctance to provoke the White House. But several close allies have gone into hiding or fled abroad after being stripped of their parliamentary immunity and accused of crimes including treason, civil rebellion and instigating insurrection. On Saturday, Venezuela’s El Nacional newspaper said Zambrano faced up to 30 years in prison for his role in the so-called “Operation Freedom” against Maduro. Guaidó recalled feeling “great expectation” as he headed to Caracas’ La Carlota airfield to launch the rebellion in the early hours of 30 April. But by noon it was clear crucial support from top military and political figures had not materialised. “We needed more,” Guaidó admitted. Despite the setback – which some view as a calamitous defeat and others a temporary hitch - Guaidó insisted the opposition was close to achieving its objective. He hinted secret negotiations aimed at securing Maduro’s departure continued and said he would talk to any civil or military figure prepared to back his cause. Asked how long Maduro had left, Guaidó said he hoped it was “nanoseconds”. “They have already lost. Venezuela hasn’t won yet … [but] I believe it is just a matter of time.” Maduro loyalists see the uprising as part of a gringo plot masterminded by Donald Trump’s White House. Pedro Carreño, a top Maduro ally, branded Guaidó’s movement a “despicable” jukebox that would play whatever tune it was paid to. Guaidó rejected his depiction as a “diabolical imperialist puppet” and urged foreign critics to consider how Chavista criminality – not US sanctions – had caused Venezuela’s collapse. “It wasn’t a tornado. It wasn’t a hurricane. It wasn’t an earthquake. It wasn’t a fire that spread uncontrollably,” Guaidó said. “No – it was caused by the corruption of this regime.” Additional reporting by Patricia Torres in Caracas"
197,terror,"London Bridge was like a war zone, says fiance of terror attack victim","The fiance of a London Bridge attack victim has described the scene where she died as like a “war zone”. Chrissy Archibald, 30, from Canada, was knocked down and killed when the attackers swerved a van into pedestrians. They then launched a knife attack in nearby Borough Market. A statement from her fiance, Tyler Ferguson, read to the Old Bailey, described how he ran after Archibald as she was dragged along the carriageway by the vehicle. At the inquest into the deaths of the victims of the 3 June 2017 attack, Ferguson told of his frantic attempts to revive her, despite knowing that she was dead. He said: “I was looking down at her body while she convulsed and released the life from her physical body.” He added that he was left “devastated and inconsolable” after her death. The couple had spent the evening at a Thai restaurant north of the River Thames on the night of the attack, and were walking back to their hotel along the south side of the bridge when the attack happened, shortly after 10pm. Ferguson described how he had confided in Archibald earlier in the evening about his difficult relationship with his father, to which she had replied that he could be “run over by a bus tomorrow” and should try to rebuild the relationship. Moments before Archibald was killed, Ferguson said that she had stopped him as they were walking to “passionately” kiss him and say: “I love you.” Ferguson had tried to call the emergency services after she was hit, but dialled 911 because he did not know the correct number for the UK. After medics had declared Archibald dead, he tried to retrieve her engagement ring but discovered it had been lost. “For the first time I took the chance to move the focus from Chrissy. It was chaos and mayhem, it was a war zone,” Ferguson said. He added that a stranger held him as he cried on his way back to the hotel he had been staying at with Archibald. Bus driver Anton Sobanski, who was driving the number 40 bus south along the bridge at the time of the attack, broke down as he described seeing Archibald after the van had stopped dragging her. The other victims who were killed were Xavier Thomas, 45, from France; Sebastien Belanger, 36, a French chef; Kirsty Boden, 28, a nurse from Australia; Ignacio Echeverría Miralles De Imperial, 39, from Spain; James McMullan, 32, from Brent, north-west London; Alexandre Pigeard, 26, a French restaurant worker and Sara Zelenak, 21, an Australian national. The attackers were Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22. The inquest continues."
198,terror,Rush to change sentencing laws before release of convicted terrorists,"Emergency terrorism laws announced after the Streatham attack could be pushed through parliament by 27 February – just one day before a convicted terrorist who disseminated Islamic State propaganda via Twitter is due for automatic release. 
Mohammed Zahir Khan, a shopkeeper from Sunderland, was sentenced to four years and six months in May 2018 for nine counts of sharing Islamist material and calling for “death to shia” Muslims. 
Investigators say he is due for automatic release on 28 February – at the mid-point of his sentence, allowing for time spend on remand – unless the government successfully changes the law to make the minimum time served two-thirds of the sentence levied at court. 
Khan initially denied the postings were his, but once police and prosecutors had demonstrated he was the author, he switched his plea to guilty, but said that he had been reckless and not set out to encourage terrorism, according to a summary of the case from the Crown Prosecution Service. 
Some of his tweets were in support of Isis. “Welcome to the year of fear, IS will make this one the deadliest ever. Mr Kuffar [non-believers] prepare for real war,” he wrote in January 2017. Another said “death to shias … death to every single one of them”.

After a trial in May 2018, Khan, then aged 40, was found guilty of terrorist offences and encouraging religious hatred, and was sentenced at Newcastle Crown Court. At the time police said: “Khan openly disseminated material over the internet that promoted terrorism and hatred of others.” 
The emergency legislation comes following a terrorist attack in Streatham, south London on Sunday. Sudesh Amman, 20, was killed by police after he stabbed two people just days after being automatically released from prison for charges of disseminating terrorist material. 
A Whitehall official said the legislation would be introduced in the Commons on 11 February. 
As the government now has a stable majority, the legislation should pass all its stages in the Commons before MPs break for recess next Thursday. It will begin its passage through the House of Lords on 25 February and the government hopes to get royal assent two days later. 
The official said: “There are no terrorist offenders who are due to receive automatic release before that date. 
“If the legislation is passed by 27 February we can prevent the automatic release of any further terrorist suspects who might pose a threat to the public. This is emergency legislation which we believe is vital for protecting the public and we are sure the Lords will wish to carry out its scrutiny quickly.” 
They added: “We cannot continue to be in a position where the state has no power to block the release of terrorists who continue to pose a threat to the public.” 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
As well as Zahir Khan, five more offenders on the same type of sentence are set to be freed in March, official sources said, slightly higher than estimates made earlier in the week by the Henry Jackson Society. 
The government said it was not aiming to retrospectively alter the sentence handed out by the court; this is a change to release arrangements that technically come under the administration of a sentence. 
“It would be our position you can change those without being considered to breach an offender’s human rights,” the official said. 
Diane Abbott, shadow home secretary, said Labour was awaiting the detail of the legislation but would be likely to support it, so long as the government “confine themselves to the way they administer the sentence” rather than seeking to change them retrospectively. 
“Bringing in the parole board to scrutinise decisions about early release is a good idea,” she added. However, Abbott said any attempt by the government to seek a derogation from the European convention on human rights (ECHR) would be a “red line” for Labour. 
Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrat justice spokesperson, said: “Rushing through knee-jerk legislation in the immediate aftermath of a terrorist attack, without the resource and plans to reduce reoffending on release, is not the way to prevent terrorism. 
“If the Conservatives plan to pass this new law in less than three weeks, it must publish it immediately so MPs can scrutinise it.” 
There has been concern from legal experts that the government’s proposals could clash with the ECHR. 
Matt Hancock, the health secretary, raised further questions over Britain’s relationship with the ECHR. When asked what he made of the warnings, he said he had heard the arguments from those against the changes but that they should go ahead. 
Lawyers think prisoners could try to appeal against the proposed changes as the ECHR contains guidelines on retrospective changes to prison sentences. 
 Hancock told Sky News: “Often in government you get a point where you have to balance the rights of different people and in this case it’s weighing up the rights of an individual who’s committed terrorist offences and his right to leave prison early against the rights of people to walk around Streatham or anywhere in our country free from the threat of terrorism.” 
The convention is enforced by the European court of human rights, an institution that is separate to the EU and to which Britain remains a member and is bound by its rules. "
199,terror,The Fortress by Alexander Watson review – a marvellous first world war study,"By the first week of March 1915, food supplies inside the besieged fortress of Przemyśl were almost exhausted. Most of the horses that could be spared had been eaten. Bran, sawdust and bone meal were used to eke out the dwindling stock of flour. Cats were nowhere to be seen – they too had been eaten. A middle-sized dog fetched 20 crowns, if its owner could be persuaded to part with it. Even mice were being traded. The hospital was filled to overflowing with collapsing people. As one of the doctors tending them observed, the most shocking thing about the starving was their indifference to their fate. “They silently and without complaint accept a cold place in the hospital, drink the slop which passes here for tea; the next day, they are moved to the morgue.” One of the marvels of Alexander Watson’s study of the bitter struggle for the fortress in 1914-1915 is his juxtaposition of magisterial technical analysis with scenes of timeless misery. The concrete and steel gun emplacements with their turrets, the fast-firing field artillery and the little wooden aeroplanes that flew in and out of the tiny fortress airstrip were all new, but the stench, the terror, the darkness, hunger and isolation were as old as the art of siege itself. In the last years before the outbreak of the first world war, Przemyśl , now on the south-eastern edge of Poland near the border with Ukraine, was a high-functioning, multicultural, central European fortress on the eastern marches of the Austro-Hungarian empire. There were attractive cafes and restaurants, theatres and concert halls, lively newspapers catering to a range of ethnicities and political tastes, German, Polish and Ukrainian secondary schools and diverse religions. For all their modernity in technical terms, the two immense concentric rings of fortifications that surrounded the city felt more like reminders of the distant past than warnings of future peril. Within weeks of the outbreak of war in the summer of 1914, Przemyśl was awash with Habsburg troops making their way towards the Russian armies. When the Russians broke the Habsburg advance, the city filled with the wounded. By 17 September, the Russians had surrounded the city and the first siege began. A renewed Habsburg offensive pushed the front back, briefly relieving the fortress, but the Russians rallied. On 8 October, a second and much more arduous siege began. It would end only when the Austro-Hungarian garrison capitulated to the Russians on 22 March 1915. Watson lucidly charts the progress of the military campaigns on both sides, deftly situating the struggle for Przemyśl within the larger history of the eastern front. He is sharply critical of the Habsburg command, highlighting their incompetence and the recklessness with which they squandered the lives of their men. Sensible precautions were sacrificed to antiquated ideas of manliness in combat. Cavalry and infantrymen were pushed forward into withering fire. The digging of foxholes was discouraged on the grounds that it “encouraged cowardice”. Towards the end of the second siege, the starving inhabitants of the fortress were harassed by the Habsburg command into mounting an assault on the Russian lines, even though the chance of a breakout was zero. When the order to retreat was finally sounded, the few who had not already been shot dead or wounded were so exhausted that even under heavy enemy fire they could only limp or crawl back to their starting positions. The main villain of the piece is the Austrian chief of the general staff, General Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, a belligerent martinet who had pressed for war at every opportunity and proceeded to fail at virtually every task he faced. Vain, arrogant, incapable of learning from his mistakes and shockingly insensitive to the suffering of his men, he was the most important single architect of the disasters that befell Przemyśl.    As elsewhere in areas that came under Russian control during the war, the Jews were singled out for special punishment    There is much more to this book than an empathetic and evocative campaign history. Watson uses the fortress city like a jeweller’s glass to show how war distorted and transformed the pre-war civilian world, poisoning it with a spirit of vendetta and ideological hatred that would not swiftly dissipate. The first non-combatant victims were the Ruthenes, speakers of various Ukrainian dialects who were suspected by the Austro-Hungarian military authorities of favouring the cause of the Russians. On the retreat towards Przemyśl, an infantry regiment of Hungarian Landsturm strung up dozens of Ruthenes from trees at the side of the road. Further atrocities took place inside the fortified rings. As one commander reminisced: “There were some [Ruthenian] villages in which the entire population had to be hanged, because they pulled out Russian rifles … and fired salvos at us.” Once the Russians were in control, a new wave of repressions began. There were attacks on Ukrainian “Greek Catholic” clergy, whose presence offended the incoming Russian Orthodox authorities. The occupation army embarked on a policy of “Russification”, whose purpose was to restore the region to its supposedly “primordial” Russian condition. And, as elsewhere in the areas that came under Russian control during the war, the Jews were singled out for special punishment. There were repeated waves of arrests, public whippings and forced labour services performed before crowds of impassive Poles and Ruthenians. Sons were made to hang their fathers, before being hanged in turn; 17,000 Jews were simply deported eastward without charges of any kind. Watson’s handling of these horrors is never gratuitous. In reconstructing in such detail the violence of the war years, he proposes an important rethinking of the history of central Europe in the 20th century. By contrast with Timothy Snyder, whose Bloodlands connects the phenomenon of ideological ultraviolence with the conflict between Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany in the 1930s and 40s, Watson backdates the inception of ethnic cleansing and racial atrocity to the era of the first world war, when the clashing protagonists were not newfangled totalitarian states, but empires of the old type. Once it was broken, the civility of the old Przemyśl, in which diverse communities, for all their squabbling, had rubbed along tolerably well, did not return. The power of this book lies in Watson’s ability to always connect such large claims to the experiences of the people who carried this war on their backs. His eye falls on all those trapped in the fortress – the doctors, airmen, merchants, troops entrenched inside the great rings of the fortress, and the sex workers and girlfriends who hoped through love affairs or trysts with officers to lay hands on food they could take to share with their families. And when the siege was over, in March 1915, more than 100,000 troops and civilians of Przemyśl made their way into Russian captivity, most of them fetching up deep in Asian Russia, where around a fifth died. One survivor, who had been 12 at the time of the siege, recalled his father’s return home in 1921: “He came in at the door buckled like a centenarian.” Watson’s splendid book combines great evocative power (and flashes of sharp humour) with the ethical authority of the best history writing. The story it tells is unsettling, because it resists any attempt to encompass the death and violence of war within a narrative of redemption. It recalls instead a war that never really ended, but rather spilled out into cascades of further violence whose toxic effects are still with us today. • Christopher Clark’s The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914 is published by Penguin.
