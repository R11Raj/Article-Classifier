0,crime,The best recent crime novels – review roundup,"    Photograph: PR    American Stephanie Wrobel’s first novel, The Recovery of Rose Gold (Michael Joseph, £14.99), begins after the point where most Munchausen’s syndrome narratives end: with confirmation that the victim is not, in fact, ill, but has been systematically made so by a supposed carer. Patty Watts, who convinced everybody that her daughter Rose Gold was desperately sick by poisoning and starving the girl for the best part of two decades, has now completed her prison sentence. Rose Gold has agreed that her mother can live in the house she shares with her infant son, and Patty hopes for reconciliation. With mother and daughter taking turns to narrate, it soon becomes clear that where manipulation is concerned, the apple hasn’t fallen far from the tree. Pacey and vivid, this is a delicate, merciless probing of a topic as unsettling as it is intriguing, with no pat answers.      Another complicated and disturbing subject, domestic violence, is the theme of Keeper by Jessica Moor (Viking, £14.99). When Katie Straw’s body is discovered in a river, the police label it a suicide. The director of the women’s shelter where Katie works thinks otherwise, but DS Daniel Whitworth and his team remain unconvinced until they discover that “Katie Straw” is a pseudonym and the identity of their corpse is unknown. A parallel narrative recounts Katie’s deteriorating relationship with her boyfriend. Initially courteous and attentive, Jamie becomes more oppressive and Katie becomes more confused – as the doughty shelter director explains, “control can feel like love”. We learn how the various women taking refuge at the shelter came to be there; their backgrounds may be different, but they all have good reason to fear for their lives. And now a man has been seen hanging around outside … Powerful and chilling, with a shocking twist, Keeper is an important story, well told.      The abandonment by society of traumatised former service personnel is also an important subject. Homeless veteran Jimmy, protagonist of Trevor Wood’s The Man on the Street (Quercus, £14.99), was invalided out of the navy after the Falklands war and left to fight his own battle with PTSD. Self-medication with alcohol resulted in a broken marriage and an estranged daughter and, having done time in prison and sofa-surfed away his remaining social capital, he has ended up sleeping on the streets of Newcastle. Waking from one of his frequent nightmares, he believes he may have witnessed a crime but, distrustful of authority and having learned the hard way to stay out of other people’s fights, he fails to report it. However, when an appeal made by the victim’s daughter jogs his conscience, the two join forces to discover what happened. Solid plotting, strong characterisation and a likable and sympathetic protagonist add up to an assured debut.      The fictitious Caribbean island of Camaho is the setting for British-Grenadian author Jacob Ross’s projected quartet of novels, the first of which, The Bone Readers, won the inaugural Jhalak prize for BAME writers in 2017. Black Rain Falling (Sphere, £14.99) continues the story of DC Michael “Digger” Digson. When his CID colleague Miss Stanislaus kills a man, their superiors believe it to be murder and give him six weeks to prove that she was acting in self-defence. The victim, Juba Hurst, who raped Miss Stanislaus when she was 14 and fathered the child she struggles to love, had been terrorising a neighbouring island, but his power was such that the police were afraid to take action. In order to investigate, Digger must negotiate a minefield of familial connections, long-standing vendettas and large-scale corruption in this atmospheric and compelling drama.      Winner of the 2018 Grand Prix de Littérature Policière, Marion Brunet’s Summer of Reckoning (translated by Katherine Gregor, Bitter Lemon, £8.99) is set in a Provence that’s a world away from the chattering classes’ holiday paradise, where poverty, boredom and casual racism are the prevailing forces. Sixteen-year-old Céline is pregnant and, despite violence from her alcoholic father Manuel, refuses to divulge the name of the man responsible. Mother Severine is dismayed at the prospect of grandmotherhood at 34; Céline’s teachers and classmates are judgmental, and her only ally is her 15-year-old sister Jo, who dreams of escape. In need of a scapegoat, Manuel, who “longs to fight – constantly and with everybody”, lights on the girls’ friend Saïd, son of Moroccan immigrants. There’s an appalling, slow-motion car crash inevitability to this concise and beautifully written novel, not only about the disastrous consequences of Manuel’s idée fixe, but also about the identity of the real father and the guilt and shame that follow.      If minimalism doesn’t do it for you, try The Clutter Corpse by Simon Brett (Severn House, £20.99), the first in a series featuring professional tidier-upper Ellen Curtis. Determined to discover the truth about the dead body she has found under a heap of junk in a hoarder’s flat, this psychologist in rubber gloves is the engaging narrator of a mostly light-hearted mystery. "
1,crime,The best recent crime and thrillers,"    Like Lucy Foley’s bestselling first foray into the crime genre The Hunting Party, The Guest List (HarperCollins, £12.99) is a very enjoyable updating of the golden age “closed world” mystery – another group of posh people, several of whom have secrets to hide, in a remote location. This time, it’s Cormorant Island, “a lump of granite emerging majestically from the Atlantic, several miles off the Connemara coastline”. Mostly peat bog, and only accessible by boat, it’s the hideaway setting for the fancy wedding of online magazine publisher Jules and her TV-star fiance Will. The wedding planner, the bride, the bridesmaid, the best man and plus-one Hannah take turns to narrate as a toxic brew of entitlement, one-upmanship, tanked- up ex-public schoolboys and past tragedies comes to a dangerous boil while a storm blows in. The plot may be overly dependent on fairly thumping coincidences, but a terrific sense of place, deft characterisation and sheer page-turnery more than compensate.      In American author Tanen Jones’s first novel, The Better Liar (Harvill Secker, £12.99), Leslie Flores needs to find her sister Robin, who absconded from the family home a decade earlier as a teenager. If she doesn’t, she won’t get her inheritance: their father’s will stipulates that the women must appear together at the lawyer’s office in order for the money to be released. When Leslie tracks her prodigal sister down to a scruffy rented room in Las Vegas and discovers a corpse with a fake ID, she flees. On meeting waitress and aspiring actor Mary, who bears enough resemblance to Robin for superficial changes to make her a plausible substitute, she offers a deal: her sister’s share of the loot in exchange for a successful impersonation. Leslie, for reasons known only to herself, is desperate for the cash, and Mary wants to start over, so if the pair can pull off the con it’s win-win, and Mary accompanies Leslie back to Albuquerque to meet her husband and infant son. It should be plain sailing, but both women have secrets ... Although the big reveal isn’t wholly convincing, there’s plenty of tension. Jones is strikingly good on emotional legacies, how – as Larkin didn’t quite put it – woman hands on misery to woman.      Irish writer Rachel Donohue’s debut, The Temple House Vanishing (Corvus, £12.99), begins a quarter of a century after the disappearances of 16-year-old schoolgirl Louisa and charismatic young art teacher Mr Lavelle, with Louisa’s erstwhile best friend Victoria leaping to her death from the top of an office block. The narrative baton is passed between Louisa (who, with Victoria, was a pupil at an elite Catholic boarding school) and an unnamed journalist – a local woman who grew up living opposite the missing girl’s house, who is writing an article to mark the 25th anniversary. Readers who are only in it for the big twist should look elsewhere, because this is all about atmosphere: the Victorian mansion on the high cliff; the hermetic world with countless petty rules, convinced of its own superiority; the hormones and hysteria; the young teacher who fills his students’ heads with romantic notions and, wanting to be adored, fails to understand the terrifyingly all-consuming nature of adolescent passion. With shades of everything from The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie and Frost in May to Picnic at Hanging Rock and The Secret History, this is subtle, intriguing and very well written.      Equally atmospheric is Sam Lloyd’s first novel, The Memory Wood (Bantam, £12.99). Abducted from a chess tournament in Bournemouth, 13-year-old prodigy Elissa is imprisoned in a cellar in a house in the mysterious “Memory Wood”, where she is visited by strange, lonely Elijah. He isn’t quite all there, but Elissa is clever and resourceful beyond her years – just as well, because although Elijah is desperate to keep his new friend she must persuade him to help her escape by indulging his Hansel &amp; Gretel fantasy while putting the strategies and gambits of the chessboard to good use. DS Mairéad McCullagh’s investigation makes a serviceable parallel narrative, and the villains are Stephen King-lite, but what makes this book special is the marvellously executed subterranean power game. Superbly creepy, with an unexpected twist, this is a very grim modern fairytale.      Another title that’s not for the squeamish is Ted Lewis’s last novel, GBH, reissued by No Exit (£9.99). Although Lewis is best known for Jack’s Return Home (the novel which was filmed as Get Carter starring Michael Caine), GBH, which was first published in 1980, is generally considered to be his finest book. Hardcore porn king George Fowler is trying to discover who’s skimming money from his business, while wife Jean, who discovered the rake-off, gets her kicks from watching him and his henchman Mickey torturing suspects. The time-slip narrative cuts between Fowler’s gangster past in London and – after things have gone very wrong indeed – his present, when he’s bug-eyed with paranoia and hiding out in an off-season holiday resort on the Lincolnshire coast. This is vintage British pulp fiction at its fast, furious and thoroughly sleazy best."
2,crime,'Crime against humanity': Trump condemned for WHO funding freeze,"Leading health experts have labelled Donald Trump’s decision to cut funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) as a “crime against humanity” and a “damnable” act that will cost lives. 
The move also drew a rebuke from the head of the United Nations, who said the WHO was “absolutely critical to the world’s efforts to win the war against Covid-19”. 
Late on Tuesday Trump declared US funding would be put on hold for 60-90 days pending a review “to assess the World Health Organization’s role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus”. The US is the single largest contributor to the WHO.

Richard Horton, the editor-in-chief of the Lancet medical journal, wrote that Trump’s decision was “a crime against humanity … Every scientist, every health worker, every citizen must resist and rebel against this appalling betrayal of global solidarity.” 
Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary general, said it was “not the time” to cut funding or to question errors. “Once we have finally turned the page on this epidemic, there must be a time to look back fully to understand how such a disease emerged and spread its devastation so quickly across the globe, and how all those involved reacted to the crisis,” said Guterres. 
“The lessons learned will be essential to effectively address similar challenges, as they may arise in the future. But now is not that time … It is also not the time to reduce the resources for the operations of the World Health Organization or any other humanitarian organization in the fight against the virus.” 
Echoing Guterres’s plea, Dr Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, said the WHO did make mistakes and may need reform but that work needed to take place after the crisis had passed. “It’s not the middle of a pandemic that you do this type of thing,” he said. 
Dr Nahid Bhadelia, an infectious disease doctor and associate professor at Boston University’s school of medicine, said the cut was “an absolute disaster. WHO is a global technical partner, the platform through which sovereign countries share data/technology, our eyes on the global scope of this pandemic.” 
Laurie Garrett, a former senior fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations, said the decision was a “damnable” act by a “spiteful” Trump and would cost lives. “Meanwhile, WHO is the only lifeline most African, Latin American and Asia Pacific nations have.” 
Lawrence Gostin, the director of the WHO centre on public health and human rights, predicted the US would ultimately lose out because other countries would step into the vacuum with increased funding. “In global health and amidst a pandemic, America will lose its voice,” said Gostin. 
The WHO has come under fire over some aspects of its handling of the pandemic, and has been accused of being too deferential to China, considering the Communist party’s early suppression of information and punishment of whistleblowers. Much of the focus of the criticism has been on a 14 January tweet from the WHO that said “preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission”. But WHO officials also told their counterparts in technical briefings on 10 and 11 January, and briefed the press on 14 January, that human-to-human transmission was a strong possibility given the experience of past coronavirus epidemics and urged suitable precautions. 
The WHO has also been attacked over its continuing exclusion of Taiwan from membership because Beijing considers it to be Chinese territory. Trump’s decision to cut funding was welcomed in some quarters, including by the Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong, who called the WHO an “arm of Chinese diplomacy”. 
 
 
  The WHO is an arm of Chinese diplomacy under the guise of liberal internationalism or global governance. Transnational cooperation is of course crucial to combating pandemics, but the institution in question is the anthesis of it, as the shunning of Taiwan makes painfully clear. https://t.co/00MYt2lBfo— Joshua Wong 黃之鋒 😷 (@joshuawongcf)

Trump’s pronouncement came amid sustained criticism of his failure to prepare for the epidemic, which has infected more than 600,000 people and killed more than 24,000 inside his country. The US is the worst affected country in the world in terms of infection numbers. On Wednesday it was reported that $1,200 relief cheques for as many as 70 million people could be delayed for several days because Trump wanted his name printed on them.

3,crime,Coronavirus crisis leads to steep drop in recorded crime,"The coronavirus crisis has led to a drop in recorded crime, by as much as 20% in some areas. 
Offences such as burglary and violence were down last week compared with the previous seven days, after Boris Johnson made his first request for people to stay home on the Monday. 
The fall this week could be even larger after the prime minister changed his pleas for social distancing into an order to stay inside. 
In one force, Durham, rated by inspectors as one of the best in England, the drop in crime was 20%. Officers recorded an average of 130 crimes a day, as opposed to an average of 165 the previous week. 
Stephen White, acting police and crime commissioner for Durham, said: “Some people rely on shoplifting to fund their drug habit. That’s harder as the shops are closed.” 
While there are some local variations, crime levels are believed to be down across the country, as are calls to police through 999 and 101, as people heed pleas to use online services, which consume less police time. 
Chief constable Andy Cooke, lead for the National Police Chiefs Council on crime, said the closure of pubs and clubs, which drive the night-time economy, and the fact that far more people were home for much more of the day were also cutting offences: “There is less violence from pub fights, less burglaries as everyone is at home.” 
However, police believe crime may start to increase as the lockdown and restrictions continue. Cooke said: “What you will see are increases in domestic violence, with people cooped up in the same home, and internet crime such as fraud and scams.” 
Cooke, who is also chief constable of Merseyside, said 7% of his force were already off because they had the virus or were self-isolating. 
In Durham 6% of officers are absent, while Greater Manchester police have 10% absent. 
The Metropolitan police, responsible for the coronavirus hotspot of London, already has an absence rate of 20%. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
He said he feared a 25-30% absence rate at the outbreak’s peak, with the force prepared to enact crisis measures and respond to 999 emergency calls only. 
Cooke developed coronavirus symptoms himself two weeks ago and tested positive last week. “These are difficult and different times for policing, we are keeping a very close eye on it, we will move staff to different departments if we need to,” he said. 
The Merseyside force has lost 1,100 officers over the past 10 years as part of the government’s austerity cuts. It is currently training 500 new recruits – who may be plucked out of the classroom and put on the beat before they officially qualify “as a last resort”, in less demanding roles such as guarding crime scenes, said Cooke. 
The chief constable said he was worried about prisoners being released early from jail because of fears the virus could sweep through overcrowded prisons: “If they are coming out without tags, I would be very concerned. Even if they come out on tags, that leaves us - the police - to ensure they are where they should be, so puts an extra workload on the police. My preference would be that they aren’t released early but it’s not my decision.” 
Regarding his own illness, he said it had “knocked me sideways”, having considered himself fit and with no underlying health issues. He insisted he had now largely recovered, barring “a nasty cough” which he had been assured was not infectious. 
The 56-year-old said: “It started with a really high temperature, aches and pains. really tight chest, a really dry cough, headaches. That was the first three or four days. 
“And then I thought I was getting through it and started to feel better for a day and a bit but it came back in the same way. Not so much the high temperature but the other symptoms were there. It was the first time I’d been off sick for 20-odd years.” 
It had been impossible to trace everyone he might have infected, he said, because he had met “too many people all over the country”. 
Cooke attended and spoke at the conference of police chiefs and police and crime commissioners in late February in central London."
4,crime,Crime in UK falls sharply since start of coronavirus lockdown,"Police have said crime has fallen by 28% since Britain was locked down to battle the coronavirus. Young people have been the biggest flouters of tough restrictions on gatherings, as the hot weather has led to defiance of emergency laws. In their most detailed picture yet of crime since laws came in to keep Britons apart, police also revealed that drug supply might be falling, with criminals posing as key workers to deal and targeting long supermarket queues to push drugs. The government rushed in emergency powers three weeks ago to enforce the lockdown, restricting when people could leave their homes and limiting gatherings to two people. Some mistakes have emerged as officers struggled to apply the new laws. Police on Wednesday admitted that 39 children had been wrongly fined for violations of restrictions. Police said those fines had been rescinded because the emergency laws do not allow them to fine those aged under 18. Falls in crime recorded by police in the four weeks up until 12 April included a 37% drop in burglary, a 27% drop in vehicle crime, serious assault and personal robbery. Reported rape offences fell by 37% and shoplifting fell by 54%, with non-essential stores closed. The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC), which issued the figures, said forces in England and Wales had seen a 3% increase in reports of domestic violence and were braced for further rises. The rise picked up so far by police is smaller than that detected by charities. Police said there had been a 59% rise in reports of antisocial behaviour, which they believed was linked to reports about alleged breaches of the emergency laws. Enforcing the lockdown rules had led to more than 3,203 fines being issued, with one given to a person aged 100, but it was clear that most fines were being issued to the young. One-third of fines were issued to those aged 18-24, with another third to those aged 25-34. Deputy chief constable Sara Glen, from the NPCC team working on the coronavirus, said younger Britons were the group struggling most to stick to the lockdown rules: “If we have good weather people naturally want to be outside. So, this is something which is a real challenge to us with our demographics in counties where they’ve got a younger population who want to party, who want to have barbecues, who want to be outside when it’s good weather.” Police stressed that the vast majority were obeying laws in the first place and that they had had more than 100,000 “chats” with people they suspected were breaking them, with the vast majority complying or not needing to have the emergency laws used against them. Some police forces appeared from data issued by the NPCC to be issuing fines more frequently than others. Lancashire issued 380 fines, possibly linked to having popular sites such as Blackpool, while Humberside only issued two fines. Hot weather played a part, police believe, in 424 fines being issued last Saturday to those flouting the rules to enjoy the sunshine over the long Easter bank holiday. But by Monday, as the weather cooled, only 177 fines were issued. Serious and organised crime was also adapting, said Lynne Owens, the director general of the National Crime Agency. She said a van driver had been caught on Tuesday near Calais with face masks concealing 14kg of cocaine. With British streets empty, drug dealers were posing as key workers to offer their commodities and even targeting long queues snaking around supermarket car parks to try to deal drugs, the woman in charge of fighting serious and organised crime said. “They are having to find new ways of working and new networks,” Owens said. “Drug dealers moving illicit drugs are concerned about greater scrutiny as they recognise that, with less people on the streets, they are more visible. Of course, they will be looking at different opportunities, wearing high-vis clothing so they start to look like key workers, deploying or dealing from supermarket car parks where there may be more people around.” The NPCC chair, Martin Hewitt, said some mistakes had been made, but they were few and understandable given that officers were under pressure, trying to enact laws restricting people’s usually lawful behaviour in a way they had never had to before: “Of course there have been mistakes and I think we have been very quick to come forward when we have made mistakes. “But I would like to think that the public would have some recognition of the fact that this is legislation that came in at high speed a few weeks ago, is highly, highly unusual and we are having to adapt to that across the whole of the service.”"
5,crime,UK crime agency loses case against ex-Kazakh president's family,"Britain’s National Crime Agency has lost a high court attempt to force the daughter and grandson of a former president of Kazakhstan to explain where they got the money to buy £80m of property in London. Last year, the NCA froze three of the family’s properties, including a mansion on north London’s so-called Billionaire’s Row with an underground swimming pool and cinema, over claims they were acquired using proceeds from unlawful activity. The agency used unexplained wealth orders (UWOs), a power introduced in 2018 known as “McMafia” laws after the BBC’s organised crime drama and book that inspired it, to freeze the assets until the owner explains the source of their wealth. This case is only the second time such an order has been used in Britain. On Wednesday, a high court judge granted an application to discharge the unexplained wealth orders. The NCA said it would appeal against the decision. One of the properties, a mansion in Hampstead, is occupied by Nurali Aliyev, the grandson of former Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev, and his wife and children. The two other properties frozen are an apartment in Chelsea, south-west London, which the campaign group Transparency International says is worth £31m, and a house in Highgate, north London. The NCA has barred any attempt to sell the properties and argues that the wealth used to buy them was linked to Rakhat Aliyev – Nurali Aliyev’s father and the former president’s son-in-law – who was found hanged in an Austrian jail in 2015 after being charged with the murder of two bankers in 2007. “UWOs are new legislation and we always expected there would be significant legal challenge over their use,” said Graeme Biggar, the NCA’s director general of the National Economic Crime Centre. “We disagree with this decision to discharge the UWOs and will be filing an appeal. We have been very clear that we will use all the legislation at our disposal to pursue suspected illicit finance and we will continue to do so.” The ultimate beneficial owners of the three properties — Rakhat Aliyev’s ex-wife, Dariga Nazarbayeva, the chair of the senate in Kazakhstan and daughter of the former Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev, and her son, Nurali Aliyev — applied to the high court to discharge the UWOs. Giving judgment remotely on Wednesday, Mrs Justice Lang overturned all three UWOs, ruling that “the NCA’s assumption” that Rakhat Aliyev was the source of the funds to purchase the three properties was unreliable. The judge said there was “cogent evidence” that Nazarbayeva and Nurali Aliyev had founded the companies that owned the properties and provided the funds to purchase them. “The court’s powerful judgment demonstrates the NCA obtained the orders on an inaccurate basis as part of a flawed investigation which was entirely without merit,” said Nurali Aliyev. Britain’s first UWOs were issued against assets belonging to Jahangir Hajiyev, who was in prison in Azerbaijan for embezzlement from the state bank, and his wife, Zamira, who spent £16.3m in the London department store Harrods. She lost her appeal against the order this year."
6,crime,Prime Suspect: how a complex crime drama succumbed to sexist cliche,"Plenty of crime dramas feature a beleaguered, hard-drinking detective with questionable social skills, but Prime Suspect was revolutionary in making a woman the protagonist. Created by Lynda La Plante, the award-winning series starred Helen Mirren as DCI (later DS) Jane Tennison and – her Oscar notwithstanding – she’s never been better. In seven brief series between 1991 and 2006, she brought this charismatic but spiky chainsmoker to life, creating the template for complex and compelling on-screen female characters in every genre. The programme’s first instalment was inspired by the experiences of former Flying Squad member Jackie Malton, and saw Tennison become the first woman in the history of the Met to lead a murder inquiry after years of being overlooked and undermined. The show was unflinching in its portrayal of the institutional sexism of the era, with her male colleagues calling Tennison a “bitch” and a “dead-arse tart” and everyone from witnesses to medical examiners assuming her subordinates were better qualified. Naturally, her professionalism and persistence in cracking the case won them over, but she was refreshingly uninterested in male approval. This trait made her uncompromising at work but was less successful in her personal life, where her mopey boyfriend left her after she failed to pull together a dinner party for his business contacts. In contrast to the disappointing tradition of single women on TV, though, Tennison was neither a sap nor tough and unfeeling. Instead, she was sharp-witted, determined, and empathetic. Mirren’s sensitive and realistic performance ensured the character changed over time, becoming both hardened by the job and softened to other people’s pain. While it did employ police procedural cliches, from sex workers with a heart of gold to the lead character’s stereotypical vices, Prime Suspect was ahead of its time in illustrating the limits and biases of the criminal justice system, especially in the second series, which told the story of a potential hate crime while also highlighting racism within the police. The script and production values could be clunky, and a season four plot that juxtaposed a missing baby with Tennison’s abortion missed the mark entirely. But the show bounced back by sending her first to Manchester and then to Bosnia in an ambitious storyline that saw its heroine investigate alleged war crimes. Its fatal mistake was in bringing Tennison back one time too many. Series seven gave us a broken woman on the brink of early retirement who blacked out after one-night stands and drank vodka before work. Although she solved the case of a murdered teenage girl, being unmarried and childless had apparently left her so desperate for human connection that she formed an inappropriately maternal bond with a suspect that almost tanked the investigation. This meant that rather than ending with a nuanced perspective on the toll of spending years exposed to violence, the show turned one of the best characters of all time into a sexist cliche, a betrayal of everything the series stood for. What a cop-out. "
7,crime,Best crime and thrillers of 2019,"In 2019 we bid farewell to one of crime fiction’s iconic investigators, Bernie Gunther. His final outing, completed shortly before author Philip Kerr’s untimely death last year, is just as gripping and immersive as its predecessors. Metropolis (Quercus) is set in Berlin in 1928, where the young Gunther finds himself on the trail of a killer of sex workers and a serial murderer who targets disabled war veterans.      This year’s most impressive debuts include the brilliant literary thriller Kill [redacted] by Anthony Good (Atlantic), an inventive exploration of the morality of revenge after a terrorist attack, and Holly Watt’s To the Lions (Raven), the first in a new series featuring investigative reporter Casey Benedict. Others worth seeking out are Kia Abdullah’s thought-provoking legal thriller, Take It Back (HQ); Laura Shepherd-Robinson’s vivid evocation of the slave trade in Georgian England, Blood &amp; Sugar (Mantle); and Scrublands (Wildfire), an accomplished slice of outback noir by Australian journalist Chris Hammer. American Spy (Dialogue) by Lauren Wilkinson is the story of black agent Marie Mitchell, recruited in the 1980s by the CIA as the bait in a honeytrap for the president of Burkina Faso, whose fledgling government the Americans are keen to destabilise.      Established practitioners who go from strength to strength include Mick Herron, whose Slough House series of spy thrillers – the sixth and most recent title is Joe Country (John Murray) – is being televised, with Gary Oldman slated to play the spectacularly repulsive Jackson Lamb. The final thriller in Don Winslow’s Cartel trilogy, The Border (HarperCollins), is social fiction at its finest, showing how Mexican gangsters, enriched by decades of America’s wrong-headed “war on drugs”, are now taking advantage of the opioid crisis. There’s more astute state-of-the-nation commentary, this time on Brexit Britain, from John le Carré in Agent Running in the Field (Viking), and on US race relations in Heaven, My Home (Serpent’s Tail) by Attica Locke. Also on the police procedural front, but in the UK, Jane Casey published her eighth DS Maeve Kerrigan book, Cruel Acts (HarperCollins), and Sarah Hilary’s DI Marnie Rome made her sixth appearance in Never Be Broken (Headline) – two intelligent series whose protagonists have real emotional depth.      Tana French took a break from her superb Dublin Murder Squad series for The Wych Elm (Viking), a compelling examination of the unreliability of memory, the effects of trauma and the relationship between privilege and what we perceive as luck. Other changes of direction include The Chain (Orion), a standalone thriller from Adrian McKinty, author of the Sean Duffy series, which invests a pyramid kidnapping scheme with compellingly appalling plausibility; and The Whisper Man (Michael Joseph), a police procedural with supernatural overtones by Steve Mosby, writing as Alex North. After almost a decade, Kate Atkinson was reunited with her series character Jackson Brodie. In Big Sky (Doubleday) the gruff PI returns to his native Yorkshire and becomes involved in a case of human trafficking and a historic paedophile ring. Catastrophically dysfunctional friendships are the key ingredient in an increasingly popular domestic noir sub-genre, of which The Hunting Party by Lucy Foley (HarperCollins) is an outstanding example. When a group of thirtysomething chums go on a mini-break to an exclusive hunting lodge in the Scottish Highlands, things soon begin to unravel: everyone, it turns out, has something to hide. Another exceptional read in this vein is Mel McGrath’s The Guilty Party (HQ), in which a group of friends all have reasons for not reporting the rape of a stranger who is later found dead.      Something this reviewer is delighted to see on the rise is what might be described as “hot-flush noir” – put-upon middle-aged women against the world – a hitherto neglected sub-genre that, given the crime-reading demographic, publishers really ought to be encouraging. Two stand-out examples are Helen Fitzgerald’s sublime Worst Case Scenario (Orenda), a foul-mouthed, satirical revenge thriller in which Glasgow probation officer Mary Shields battles career burnout and the menopause, and The Godmother (Old Street) by Hannelore Cayre, translated from French by Stephanie Smee. Winner of both the Grand Prix de Littérature Policière and the European Crime Fiction prize, this witty, acerbic gem is the story of a fiftysomething widowed mother of two who, facing a precarious future, decides to become a drug dealer.      This year saw the 50th anniversary of the Manson murders and books exploring cults included Lisa Jewell’s The Family Upstairs (Century) and Fog Island (HQ) by Scientology survivor Mariette Lindstein, translated from Swedish by Rachel Willson-Broyles. Lastly, there have been a number of welcome reissues, including Susanna Moore’s erotic classic In the Cut (W&amp;N), a terrifying tale of death and sex first published in 1995, and, from several decades earlier, The Listening Walls and A Stranger in My Grave (both Pushkin Vertigo), by the queen of north American domestic noir, Margaret Millar (1915-1994). It all adds up to a bumper year. • Save up to 30% on the books of the year at guardianbookshop.com"
8,crime,The best recent crime novels – review roundup,"    Australian author Chris Hammer’s second novel, Silver (Wildfire, £16.99), picks up journalist Martin Scarsden’s career a few months after the events of his impressive debut, Scrublands, which won a Crime Writers’ Association award this year. Scarsden has been writing a book about why a priest in the outback opened fire on his congregation, and he is now about to set up home with Mandalay Blonde, the woman he met while he was reporting on the case. They plan to move to Port Silver on the coast of New South Wales, the town where he grew up and where – by a fairly hefty coincidence – she has inherited a large, rundown property. Arriving at their rented house, Scarsden finds the corpse of local estate agent Jasper Speight, and a dazed Blonde with blood on her hands. As he tries to prove her innocence, old grievances and tensions over land ownership come to light, and it’s clear his own disturbing past isn’t going to stay buried. Richly descriptive, with a large and well drawn cast, this is an immersive and enjoyable novel that lives up to the promise of its predecessor.      Another antipodean coastal town with plenty of secrets is the setting for a first venture into romantic suspense by paranormal romance author Nalini Singh. A Madness of Sunshine (Gollancz, £14.99) is set on the west coast of New Zealand’s South Island, in the largely Māori town of Golden Cove. Shocked by the sudden death of her husband and the subsequent discovery of his perfidy, classical pianist Anahera Rawiri returns from London to lick her wounds. She gets to know policeman Will Gallagher, a new arrival with plenty of his own baggage. When teenage beauty Miriama goes missing, memories are revived of three female hikers who disappeared 15 years earlier and were never found; Rawiri acts as a bridge between Will and a community that has little trust in either outsiders or authority. Although neither the police procedure nor the characterisation, particularly of the myriad male suspects, is wholly believable – Gallagher appears to be the only half-decent man in the entire place – this is an atmospheric read with a compelling sense of the spectacular rugged landscape.      Gerald Seymour’s 1975 debut, Harry’s Game, was set in Belfast during the Troubles; since then, over the course of thirtysomething novels, he has written about strife in places as diverse as Afghanistan, South Africa and Guatemala. In Beyond Recall (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, £18.99) it’s the Russian Arctic city of Murmansk, virtually sunless in winter and “big on sexually transmitted disease, ferocious seasonal mosquitos, drug abuse and the architecture of Stalin, Khrushchev and Brezhnev”. Traumatised former special operative Gaz, one of two surviving witnesses to an atrocity in a Syrian village, is dispatched there by MI6 agent Knacker – one of the old guard, acting very much off his own bat – to identify the man who oversaw the massacre. Meanwhile, Jasha, a veteran of the Soviet army who lives in an isolated cabin on the tundra, forms a friendship of sorts when he helps a wounded bear. Although the choppy style, all  comma splices and dropped pronouns, takes a bit of getting used to, it’s well worth the effort for an old school but highly enjoyable thriller.      Mary Kelly (1927-2017) beat John le Carré to the 1961 CWA gold dagger, but she has been largely forgotten, so it’s good to learn that her 1958 novel The Christmas Egg (British Library, £8.99) has been reissued. On 22 December Inspector Brett Nightingale is called to a squalid north London flat, in which elderly Russian refugee Princess Olga Karukhina lies dead. The circumstances are suspicious, with an empty trunk under the bed leading Nightingale to believe that valuable objects from the deceased’s imperial past have been stolen. Darker and more psychologically acute than much conventional golden age fare, and with less reliance on the puzzle element, The Christmas Egg has a surprising amount of action as the quest for the treasures becomes ever more dangerous.      Lastly, in a category all of its own, The Lammisters by Declan Burke (No Alibis, £16.99) is a metafictional tale of bootleggers and starlets on the run from the LAPD in 1920s Hollywood, their exploits fuelled by bathtub hooch swigged from teacups. Yes, there’s a plot, but that’s not really the point, because the book is written in the discursive manner of Laurence Sterne, with an overanxious, officious narrator who is soon forced to admit that he is having difficulty keeping tabs on what’s going on. A triumph of absurdity, which burlesques the literary canon from Shakespeare, Pope and Austen to Flann O’Brien, Damon Runyan and PG Wodehouse, so that the act of reading becomes a detective story in itself, The Lammisters is very clever indeed. Its central hypothesis – that the world might be a better place if everyone made a little more effort to get along – makes it perfect reading for the season of goodwill."
9,crime,The best recent crime and thrillers – review roundup,"    The ambitious first standalone novel from Steph Cha is a fictional treatment of the 1991 shooting of African American schoolgirl Latasha Harlins by Korean-born shop owner Soon Ja Du. Du suspected the 15-year-old of shoplifting, and her lenient treatment by the court, which caused tension between the two communities, is often cited as one of the causes of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. In Your House Will Pay (Faber, £12.99), the action moves between 1991, when black teenager Ava Matthews is killed after an altercation in a Korean convenience store, and 2019, when the wounding of Grace Park’s mother in a drive-by shooting leads to a shocking revelation about her past. Seen through the eyes of both Grace and Ava’s ex-convict brother Shawn, who is trying to put his past behind him, this is a nuanced and convincing portrait of two communities at loggerheads. Cha does not shy away from moral ambiguity as she explores cultural burdens, anger and unintended consequences.      The Aosawa Murders by Riku Onda (translated by Alison Watts, Bitter Lemon, £8.99) also deals with the aftermath of a crime: here, it’s the poisoning of 17 people, including children, during a family party in 70s Japan. The case is closed when the delivery man who brought the cyanide-laced alcohol and soft drinks to the house kills himself, leaving an apparently incriminating note, but Inspector Teru is convinced that he knows the identity of the real culprit. So, apparently, does neighbour Makiko Saiga, who writes a bestselling book about the case, though the “clues” in her narrative are somewhat oblique. We hear from these two and various others, including the sole surviving member of the Aosawa family, mysterious Hisako, 30 years after the murder. Tantalising as a scene glimpsed through a half-open door, this is an utterly immersive puzzler in which nothing is entirely cut and dried.      The past also has a devastating impact on the present in Rebecca Wait’s Our Fathers (Riverrun, £14.99). Tom Baird returns to the remote Scottish island of his birth, where, more than 20 years earlier, his father John shot his mother Katrina, brother and baby sister before turning the gun on himself. Tom, who was eight at the time, survived by hiding in a wardrobe, and lived with his uncle Malcolm until he was old enough to leave the island. Now, racked with survivor guilt and trapped by the past, he’s looking for answers. Malcolm wants to help, but is weighed down by his own feelings of guilt for not preventing the massacre; rendered inarticulate by an act of such horrific and inexplicable violence, the two men struggle to communicate. A second narrative strand, written from Katrina’s point of view, shows how she came to marry John, the corrosive nature of their relationship, and the inevitability – “Of course he would kill her” – of its ending. Wait wisely avoids the temptations of melodrama to create an astonishingly powerful story of toxic masculinity, regret and the possibility of redemption.      A far cry from its London namesake, the district of Kensington in Philadelphia – the setting for Liz Moore’s Long Bright River (Hutchinson, £12.99) – is the largest market for narcotics on the US’s east coast. For police officer and single mother Mickey Fitzpatrick, it’s not only her beat, but the place where her sister, Kacey, turns tricks in order to fund her addiction. A time-slip narrative describes how drugs have blighted Mickey’s life before – they killed her mother, and her dad, long disappeared, is presumed dead – and how, in the present day, a serial killer appears to be targeting sex workers. Although this police-procedural-meets-family-drama is not about the opioid crisis per se, it paints a stark picture of the devastation caused by drug abuse. As Mickey realises the first time that Kacey – then aged 16 – is brought back to life with Narcan after an overdose: “None of them want to be saved. They all want to sink backward toward the earth again, to be swallowed by the ground, to keep sleeping.” After a mostly slow pace, the book’s conclusion feels overly hasty, but strong characters and some truly evocative writing more than make up for it.      The first time we meet the family at the centre of Doug Johnstone’s new series, they are busy burning the body of patriarch Jim, according to his wishes, on a makeshift pyre in their Edinburgh back garden. The Skelfs are funeral directors – hence their ability to perform DIY cremations – with a sideline in private investigating. In A Dark Matter (Orenda, £8.99), three generations of women put their experience to good use, dealing with the disappearance of granddaughter Hannah’s best friend and the discovery of Jim’s mysterious payments to the wife of a former employee, as well as a steady stream of cadavers and a case of adultery that turns out to be anything but straightforward. This enjoyable mystery is also a touching and often funny portrayal of grief, as the three tough but tender main characters pick up the pieces and carry on: more, please. "
10,crime,YouTuber Humza Arshad uses humour to tackle violent crime,"“I always found myself playing the part of terrorist number two, [with] just one line: ‘Allahu Akbar’.” The YouTube star Humza Arshad shouts the last two words with such force that pupils at Harris Academy jump, before roaring with laughter. It might seem an unlikely joke to make at a school workshop tackling violent crime and extremism, but that is precisely why Arshad is here: to break down the barriers that can prevent the message getting across. The actor-comedian’s YouTube series Badman and the earlier Diary of a Bad Man have won him a huge youth following: he has had more than 100m views. For the past two weeks, with Metropolitan police counter-terrorism officers, he has visited 16 schools in eight London boroughs particularly affected by violent crime. At the final workshop, at Harris Academy in Peckham, he has the children – aged 11 to 15 – eating out of his hands with his jokes before moving on to more serious issues. “I’m from south London, so I know how dangerous it can be outside,” the Streatham-born comedian, clad in woolly hat and big hooded coat, tells the audience of more than 200 children. He shares the story about how his friend Ché Morrison was stabbed to death last year in Ilford, east London. The silence is punctuated by the odd gasp as he tells them how the killers filmed his friend as he lay dying, and he ended up seeing the footage of Morrison’s last breaths. Arshad admits to being a “very different person” before he became a comedian. “I don’t like telling this story when the police are here,” he says, to laughs, before recalling a story about an aborted revenge attack in his youth.     Humza Arshad, whose YouTube series Diary of a Bad Man and Badman satirise British Asian culture, addresses schoolchildren at Harris Academy, Peckham, south London. Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian    The comedian says he was moved to speak to schoolchildren by Morrison’s death, the New Zealand mosque attack, and increasing intolerance since the Brexit vote. He has also co-directed and acts in a short 12-minute film, Hate, shown at all the schools he has visited and launching on his YouTube channel on Monday. The film does not pull punches, depicting the cyclical nature of hate, and taking in gang violence, stabbings, shootings, acid attacks and extremism. It also addresses frustrations young people feel with the police, with Arshad’s character bemoaning the fact his wife’s attacker would probably have been caught “if his skin was darker”. Two counter-terrorism officers present at the Peckham workshop discuss some of the issues raised by the film, as well as the use of fake news to spread extremism, tactics used by gangs to coerce young people, and homophobia. There is palpable shock among the Harris Academy pupils when they pull up a photograph on the big screen of a smiling “normal” 17-year-old, before revealing him to be Salman Abedi, who, five years later, detonated an explosive vest at an Ariane Grande concert in Manchester.     Arshad’s workshop met with laughter at Harris Academy, where pupils praised his approach to the serious topics addressed. Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian    Afterwards, pupils were full of praise for the workshop, and for Arshad in particular. Farhan Khan, 14, said the issues raised were pertinent given that an ex-student of the academy, Malcolm Mide-Madariola, was stabbed to death aged 17 in 2018. Khan said of Arshad: “He came out of this culture so it’s more of a personal story. I’d rather have someone being jokey about it rather than just serious. It was really good, really inspiring, the film was great, it gave a good message.” Fabiola Banora, 14, who said that her brother was stabbed when riding his bike, praised the film for examining why people are getting into crime, saying it was “a conversation that isn’t going on in our communities”. She added: “We have respect for what the police do but seeing someone [like Arshad] that comes from that [same background], looks like us, dealing with the same issues, saying we can live better, as people from disadvantaged communities, you couldn’t relate to a police officer [saying that].” Arshad acknowledged the logic. “It’s easy for me to come in being the cool one and making them laugh, breaking the barriers with comedy and then once they engage, without being preachy, being able to teach or inform,” he said. “The police are aware of the perception they tend to have in the wider community but the police are teaming up with me to try to change that.”"
11,crime,Solid Gold review – sluggish Polish crime thriller,"Corruption runs yet again all the way to the top – but this even-paced, overlong Polish thriller barely musters a shrug about it, let alone sell Baltic port Gydnia as a kind of James Ellroy-esque helltown. Discharged from the force after being raped on a stakeout, tough-nut cop Kaja (Marta Nieradkiewicz) is lured back to the coast by the Central Bureau of Investigation to help bring down drug baron Kawecki (Andrzej Seweryn). The silver-fox plutocrat has mastered the art of hiding in plain sight: the well-to-do head of the Solid Gold bank, he launders his money through a posh restaurant and butters up Warsaw politicians for favours. Director Jacek Bromski manages the curious combination of being both too impatient to push his case and too slow to make us care. The initial sexual assault, a series of attention-drawing murders, Kawecki’s dealers later bringing their takings directly to the bank – either Gydnia’s criminal class are completely foolhardy, or the plausibility police need to have a closer look at Bromski’s script. At the same time, he seems only half-interested in Kaja, who starts out loaded with Lisbeth Salander attitude, kickboxing a wine-bar creep to the ground, until the story meanders away from her. Bromski’s preoccupations belatedly turn out to be more wintry. Only generating intermittent heat from the investigation itself, his focus shifts to whether – given the political interests on whose toes it treads – the investigation will take place at all. Here, Kaja’s seasoned boss Nowicki (played with crinkled, phlegmatic reserve by Kieslowski regular Janusz Gajos) takes the reins. He indicts Kawecki’s “dictatorial” lust for power, but admits to Kaja that, in his eagerness to nail the businessman, he has become a dictator himself. There is tragedian’s meat here – but Bromski never fully carves it up. • Solid Gold is released in the UK on 6 December.           "
12,crime,"Longer sentences will not cut crime, say prison experts","Boris Johnson’s hardline approach to justice will not cut crime and will only pile pressure on overstretched prisons, expert campaigners have said, as research reveals life sentences have already risen sharply. The Prison Reform Trust issued the stark warning just days after the government unveiled proposals to lock up some serious violent and sexual offenders for longer by scrapping automatic release halfway through a jail sentence. Offenders serving standard determinate sentences of seven years or more, where the maximum sentence is life, will be released at the two-thirds point, rather than halfway, under the changes unveiled last week. Introducing a new report, the Prison Reform Trust director, Peter Dawson, said the government was looking in the wrong places to restore confidence in the justice system. He said: “Longer sentences haven’t improved public confidence or safety before, and they won’t now. But they have helped produce a prison system that fails to deliver either safety or rehabilitation. “Good soundbites don’t always make good policy – a coherent plan for reform is long overdue.” Researchers suggest England and Wales are already tougher on punishing serious crime than other countries. Prof Ben Crewe and Dr Susie Hulley, from the University of Cambridge, and Dr Serena Wright, from Royal Holloway, University of London, found a dramatic increase in the number of people serving life sentences. According to the findings, fewer than 100 people a year were handed a life sentence with a minimum term of 15 years in England and Wales between 2000 and 2003. By 2008, this had risen to 249 adults and as of September 2019, 1,872 life sentence prisoners had tariffs of more than 20 years. Last year, there were also 880 serving a minimum of 25 years and 291 with a tariff of more than 30, excluding those serving the whole-life tariff who are unlikely to ever be released.   Related: High number of prison deaths are preventable, says damning new report    The findings of the report indicate there was no clear evidence that the latest rise in lengths of tariffs is linked to changes in the nature or severity of offending. The research claims growing numbers of people serving long sentences will mean prisons are likely to remain overcrowded for the foreseeable future. A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: “Under this government, serious violent and sexual offenders will spend more time where they belong – behind bars. We are spending £2.75bn on transforming and modernising the estate, including creating 10,000 additional prison places.”"
13,crime,Lost Girls review – well-intentioned but plodding Netflix true crime drama,"Premiering at the tail-end of this year’s Sundance film festival to faint applause, the earnest fact-based drama Lost Girls has made a swift beeline less than two months later for its rightful home: Netflix. While the platform has increasingly stretched itself to prove that it can, or at least try to, do everything, one of its most consistently popular subgenres is true crime, proved by everything from Making a Murderer to the recent hit The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez, appealing to an endless, morally dubious, public lust for violence, tragedy and, sometimes, justice.   Related: Spenser Confidential review – Mark Wahlberg crash lands on Netflix    Its output in this area can often feel exploitative, not a word that describes Lost Girls, a sensitively made yet frustratingly plodding film based on a still unsolved spate of killings by the so-called Long Island Serial Killer, detailed in a bestselling book by journalist Robert Kolker. Police believe that he killed between 10 and 16 people over a 20-year period but the film zeroes in on one missing young woman and how the search for her led to the discovery of four other bodies. It’s a tale of righteous indignation, police incompetence and the inability of men with authority to listen to and believe the voices of women. Mari Gilbert (Amy Ryan) is a mother struggling on the breadline, working two jobs to try to provide for her two daughters. A third, her eldest Shannan, lives elsewhere with Mari reluctantly asking her for financial assistance every now and then. Exactly where Shannan gets her money from is unspoken but known by Mari, a family secret that gets unearthed when Shannan goes missing.              As a sex worker who found her clients on Craigslist (the perpetrator was also known as the Craigslist Killer), Shannan was quickly ignored or at least de-prioritised by police, who judged her in the same broad and moralistic way that the media also did at the time. Unwilling to let her daughter’s disappearance become old news, Mari rallies together with the families of women whose bodies have been found and starts to put the pieces together with or without police help. Lost Girls is the first narrative feature from documentarian Liz Garbus, whose previous subjects have covered everything from Nina Simone to the Holocaust, and throughout the film, she struggles to find the right balance between muted naturalism and button-pushing Hollywood formula. Admirable restraint in some scenes is followed by crusty cliche in others and while some actors dial it down, others lean into tropes, such as Lola Kirke as a cartoonish prostitute and 30 Rock’s Dean Winters as a bumbling cop. Ryan is similarly unmodulated, believably raw at times and then uncomfortably grandstanding at others. It’s a pleasure to see her given so much screen time but it’s not a performance that ever cuts quite as deep as it needs to, our emotional attachment to the unfolding devastation wavering at best. Garbus and screenwriter Michael Werwie embed the film with a timely anger, showing us an all-too-familiar culture of victim-shaming and unfairly attributed blame, all at the feet of women. There’s also an undercurrent of respect afforded to those working in the sex industry who too often get labelled on and off screen and the film is never less than well-intentioned but intentions only get us so far. As sincere and as sensitive as the film might be, it’s never as involving or as effective as the story at its centre. One of the most shocking details is revealed in a text coda which thrusts a poorly developed subplot to the forefront, one of many strands and character dynamics that don’t get enough time or depth. At 95 minutes, Lost Girls is sorely lacking and, ironically, one wonders what a Garbus docuseries could have found instead.  Lost Girls is available on Netflix on 13 March "
14,crime,How to Fix a Drug Scandal: behind a staggering Netflix crime docuseries,"The day Sonja Farak’s world unraveled – the day a crack pipe and sliced evidence bags of cocaine were found at her workstation – started like many others: she attended court. A drug chemist in a lab at Amherst, Massachusetts, one of the state’s two main drug testing facilities, Farak was responsible for testing evidence obtained by police. Her certified assessment of the content and amount secured thousands of drug convictions for the state, and she routinely appeared in court to affirm them; without a chemist’s signature proving an illegal substance, the charges of possession could not stand. Usually, this process was unremarkable, occurring off-stage, but Farak’s arrest on 19 January 2013 for drug theft and evidence tampering raised an alarming possibility: if she was high while at work, her tests could be thrown out, and the convictions overturned. Farak had worked at the lab for nearly a decade, contributing to thousands of prison sentences. How long had this been going on?   Related: Murder, madness and tigers: behind the year's wildest Netflix series    The arrest of the then 35-year-old Farak, depicted in the opening scenes of Netflix’s documentary series How to Fix a Drug Scandal, shocked a Massachusetts criminal justice system already reeling from another drug chemist scandal. Just six months earlier, in August 2012, Annie Dookhan, a chemist at the Hinton Labs in Boston, was caught forging tens of thousands of tests in order to win over her superiors and prosecutors as a star employee; her arrest immediately threw thousands of convictions into legal limbo. Dookhan and Farak didn’t know each other, and worked at opposite ends of the state, but their collective actions exposed a badly neglected system designed to streamline the “war on drugs”, in which the actions of one unreliable actor resounded powerfully. “It’s the sheer ripple effect,” Erin Lee Carr, who directed all four episodes of the series, said to the Guardian. “We’re not talking about 10 cases, we’re not talking about a thousand cases. We’re talking upwards of 20,000 cases that were impacted by two chemists.” It was an unprecedented nightmare for Massachusetts, one How to Fix a Drug Scandal dissects in suspenseful yet compassionate fashion over the course of four hours, with first-person interviews from criminal defense lawyers who fought to secure release for clients convicted with faulty evidence, state prosecutors, journalists and members of Farak’s family. (Farak, now out of prison, spoke with Carr off-the-record, but declined an on-the-record interview due to an ongoing civil case.) The series also delves into a second, more insidious layer of scandal: the state attorney general office’s efforts to downplay Farak’s liability to past convictions. Whereas Dookhan’s arrest jammed court dockets with thousands of appeals and overturned numerous faulty convictions, there was near silence after Farak’s arrest, as the state attorney general’s office buried evidence of Farak’s longstanding drug addiction, blocked legal attempts to view evidence, lied to district attorneys and misled two circuit court judges – a five-year attempt to keep defendants from questioning their convictions that one judge called “a fraud upon the court”.              Carr first heard of the Dookhan scandal incidentally, during interviews for her film I Love You, Now Die: The Commonwealth vs Michelle Carter, about another sensational Massachusetts trial, in 2016. Shortly afterward, she met journalist Paul Solotaroff, who was writing a feature on the attorney general office’s misconduct and introduced her to the Farak case. Carr was familiar with the plea deal system in the US, which coerces drug defendants into plea-bargained sentences, lest they risk trial, and thus a harsher sentence. But she didn’t understand how integral crime labs were to drug convictions, or the role of criminal defendants. Enter Luke Ryan, an amiable and dogged defense attorney from western Massachusetts who serves as How to Fix a Drug Scandal’s guide through the thicket of appeals after Farak’s arrest. Ryan pestered for years to get access to the attorney general’s files, which confirmed his suspicion – one an actor retells in a recreation of Farak’s grand jury testimony in the series – that Farak was using long before the incident leading to her arrest. “I think a lot of people, when they encounter these cases, they’re like, ‘Well, you know, the people had drugs, and they’re guilty,’” Carr said. “And I say back to you: imagine spending a couple years in prison based on faulty evidence, and see if you feel the same way.” It’s not just the sentences hinging on accurate drug evidence tests; it’s the challenges of life post-incarceration, in which life-building steps such as getting a job or finding adequate housing are jeopardized by a drug conviction. “It does not stop the day you get out of prison,” said Carr.     A still from How to Fix a Drug Scandal. Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix @ 2020    To that end, How to Fix a Drug Scandal features two of Ryan’s clients, including Rafael Rodriguez, who struggled with drug addiction and was convicted based on a sample certified by Farak. Ryan tried for years to secure Rodriguez’s freedom, which resulted in years of legal limbo and merry-go-round of prison stays which exacted a heavy toll. Rafael’s children and wife recall a goofy, kind-hearted man, one evidenced in old cellphone footage, hamming for the camera. But the conviction, which a judge kept based on the attorney general office’s withheld evidence, prevented him from moving forward. While the series delves into the impact of mishandled evidence and, more pressingly, the state’s unrepentant “war on drugs”, Carr also provides space for the motivations of Dookhan, a first-generation striver validated for her “productivity” and helpfulness, and especially Farak. Farak’s sister and mother explain her longstanding battle with depression and feelings of invisibility, which in part fueled her drug use. Offering context for their thought processes was “a product of my sobriety”, said Carr, who has been public with her own struggles with addiction. “In my program, you are not equal to your worst actions. It’s how I was raised.” Carr’s father, David Carr, was a storied cultural critic at the New York Times whose memoir The Night of The Gun details his own addiction to cocaine and alcohol. “I’ve always encountered true crime and criminal justice reporting from a place of radical empathy,” said Carr, though she added: “I want to be clear: addiction explains everything and excuses nothing.” Still, How to Fix a Drug Scandal outlines a much larger picture: how one addict’s actions crystallizes the arbitrariness of criminalizing addiction, how two chemists are not isolated bad apples, but symptoms of a rotten system which, of course, disproportionately and expeditiously convicts people of color. “These types of things only flourish when people assist in them,” Carr said. Boston’s Hinton Labs, now shut down, incentivized productivity and supportive relationships with prosecutors. “She was going through three, four, five times the number of cases that other chemists were – that was not normal, and it was OKed because there was such an incredible backlog in cases that they needed to get through it,” said Carr. In Farak’s case, the Amherst lab was so underfunded, understaffed and overburdened that her drug use went unnoticed for a whole decade. “I think the system needed to be brought to task,” said Carr. The Hinton Lab is now closed, Amherst lab shuttered, but the vulnerabilities of little-seen yet consequential drug labs aren’t specific to Massachusetts. “This is a product of the war on drugs done on the cheap,” said Carr. “And we will continue to see cases like this if we don’t really take a good, hard look at drug labs and what they’re doing.”  How to Fix a Drug Scandal is now available on Netflix "
15,crime,Blue Murder at 25: why it's a pulse-pounding Australian crime classic,"The writer-director David Michôd’s outstanding 2010 crime drama Animal Kingdom has been called “Scorsesean” more times than the average person washes their hands every day during this terribly dark and distressing period. But for me the most Scorsesean Australian production of them all isn’t a film but a two-part television miniseries that turns 25 this year. It is, if you’ll pardon the hackneyed turn of phrase, once seen and never forgotten: the pulse-pounding Blue Murder, a masterpiece of the true-blue gangster genre.   Related: Travel Man: Richard Ayoade and friends are hilarious tour guides for a travel-less world    Michael Jenkins, who also directed the belated – and excellent – 2017 sequel Blue Murder: Killer Cop, evokes the vibe of a Scorsese crime film in several ways, firstly and most obviously in the depiction of organised crime. (Australian westerns are sometimes referred to as “meat pie westerns”. Should Aussie productions about organised crime have a similar name? Maybe ... Vegemite gangsters? Schooner and parmigiana mobsters?) But it’s also in the show’s gritty texture and street-side verisimilitude, and the way the escalating force of its drama hits you like a slap on the face. There’s also extensive multi-person voiceover narration, a bold device used in the Scorsese classics Goodfellas and Casino. This counters the scuzzy settings and hotheaded characters with an almost literary intensity – if that word “literary” didn’t feel light years removed from the many fiends and lowlifes depicted. Jenkins establishes a cracking pace from the get-go, opening with the sound of a train rumbling down tracks accompanied by bursts of bluesy saxophone as the frame homes in on two nervous-looking men sitting in a car outside a bank. “Something’s up mate, you made a blue!” yelps Neddy Smith (Tony Martin) to his companion, who assures him that the people they’re waiting for are coming. “So’s Christmas!” Neddy snaps back, setting in motion a production full of distinctively, inimitably Australian vernacular captured by the screenwriter, Ian David. The ’strayan turn of phrase is enunciated by an excellent albeit extremely blokey cast – including Richard Roxburgh, Steve Bastoni, Peter Phelps, Alex Dimitriades, Bill Hunter, Gary Sweet, John Hargreaves – and there’s even a brief cameo from the great Richard Carter.     Richard Roxburgh as Roger Rogerson in Blue Murder Photograph: Supplied    Then Neddy’s voiceover begins: “This was a stupid thing for us to do. But I was young and Bobby Chapman swore it’d be an easy go.” The scene we’re watching is a botched robbery; this pair of two-bit crims fail to stop their targets and flee the scene, yelling and screaming. The next scene shows Neddy being nabbed by another key character, Roger “the Dodger” Rogerson (Roxburgh), who stuffs a pump-action shotgun in this face and exclaims, “Gotcha, Neddy!” By this point quite a lot has happened, and yet barely two and a half minutes of running time have elapsed – demonstrating breathtaking narrative efficiency. The ensuing story, based on true events and set in Sydney during the 1970s and 80s, pivots between Neddy – who becomes a police informant – and Rogerson, a notoriously corrupt cop and convicted murderer now in jail serving a life sentence. How best to describe Neddy and the Dodger’s relationship: friends? Frenemies? Colleagues? Maybe the latter. The pair have many work meetings, after all, flagrantly hanging out in public places – dining at a Chinese restaurant, for instance, or necking beers at a pub.   Related: Autism, sex and consent: Everything’s Gonna Be Okay breaks ground with a story that rings true | Clem Bastow    The narrative pivots between them before adding a third key player – undercover cop Michael Drury (Bastoni) – who is introduced in a knuckle-gobbling drug deal sequence that leads straight into an exhilarating car chase, staged with a gritty raciness that reminded me of the bat-out-of-hell energy of the 1975 drug drama Pure Shit. Each of these key characters get a voiceover track sprinkled with the aforementioned very-fair-dinkum turns of phrase. At one point the Dodger notes that “real police work – the sort that puts hardened criminals behind bars – means forming relationships with people you wouldn’t piss on if they were on fire”. Roxburgh delivers one of his all-time greatest performances, which was extended in Killer Cop, a sequel that tracked subsequent real-life chapters in this fascinatingly odious, double-dealing man’s life. Martin, emoting from underneath a thick film of sweat, is totally magnetic as Neddy, managing to combine terrible forcefulness with a sort of pathetic vulnerability. It’s a shame we don’t see more of Martin on our screens today. Where is he? Why aren’t director’s knocking on his door? Bring him back, I say, and give the man a career renaissance. Failing that, you can bring him back to the screen yourself: by adding Blue Murder to your lists of things to check out during self-isolation. If you haven’t seen it, you should rectify the situation; if you have, it’s imminently rewatchable. Gotcha, Neddy! • Blue Murder is streaming on SBS On Demand"
16,crime,The best recent crime novels – review roundup,"    Former New Zealand detective Nathan Blackwell’s debut, The Sound of Her Voice (Orion, £14.99), is a police procedural with a difference. There is no inciting incident: the narrative follows the career of Detective Matt Buchanan through the years as a colleague dies in his arms, he deals with a young rape victim and investigates drug dealers, skeletal remains are found in a mangrove swamp and a child’s body is discovered in the dunes. This is authentic stuff – real policing, with the grunt work far outstripping the glory. Haunted by a young woman who has been missing since 1999, and frustrated by the justice system, Buchanan takes a break to become a flying instructor before being drawn back to the force. It’s at this point that the action revs up to thriller speed and, while some of the credibility may be lost in the process, The Sound of Her Voice remains a convincingly raw portrait of a fundamentally decent individual whose mental health and moral compass are in danger of being destroyed by the trauma of constant exposure to the worst that humanity can offer.      Will Carver’s latest book, Nothing Important Happened Today (Orenda, £8.99), is even harder to categorise. Beginning with nine people tying nooses around their necks and jumping to their deaths from London’s Chelsea Bridge, this tale of the People of Choice, a mysterious suicide cult spreading across the globe through social media, is at once fantastical and appallingly plausible. Although its members have no knowledge of one another, they are “triggered” by the arrival, in the post, of pre-written suicide notes. The police are baffled: there is no link between these individuals, and their leader doesn’t appear to exist. With a laconic authorial voice, plenty of interesting information about the psychology of cults, and intense vignettes of soon-to-be-ended lives, this mesmeric novel paints a thought-provoking if depressing picture of modern life.      The Vanished Bride (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, £14.99) is the first in a new series featuring the Brontë sisters as “lady detectors”, by bestselling author Rowan Coleman (writing – with a nod to the real Emily’s nom de plume – as Bella Ellis). It’s 1845, and the peace of Haworth parsonage is shattered when brother Branwell brings Charlotte, Emily and Anne news of the disappearance and presumed murder of Elizabeth, second wife of Robert Chester of nearby Chester Grange. After some initial grinding of gears as the plot gets under way, things proceed smoothly into gothic territory, with hidden panels, incriminating notes and doubts over the fate of the first Mrs Chester. Brontë fans will undoubtedly get the most out of this: possible inspirations for Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall are everywhere. But you don’t need insider knowledge to enjoy either the splendid adventure, or the touching and often funny portrayal of the sisters’ devotion to and exasperation with one another and their debauched brother.      Branwell Brontë might well have benefited from the drastic but effective ayurvedic detoxification regime to which Abir Mukherjee’s opium-addict protagonist, Detective Sam Wyndham, subjects himself in Death in the East (Harvill Secker, £12.99). The fourth novel in this excellent series differs from the previous three in that the action is set not only in India – in this case, Assam, where Wyndham visits an ashram to undertake his cure in February 1922 – but also in the East End of London, 17 years earlier, where, as a young policeman, he investigates the murder of a woman he once loved. Wyndham’s assistant Sergeant Banerjee appears fairly late on in the proceedings, and it’s fascinating to see the power balance between the two men begin to change, reflecting the indigenous population’s growing unease with the occupying power. Death in the East is as vivid and atmospheric as its predecessors. If the Whitechapel sections are less gripping, it’s because of their Ripperesque familiarity, and although the connection between the earlier and later killings is something of a coincidence, the extraordinary inventiveness of the two locked-room mysteries more than makes up for it.      Another author with a penchant for locked-room puzzles and a recovering-addict protagonist is Seishi Yokomizo (1902-1981). Often referred to as Japan’s answer to John Dickson Carr, and with a fair claim to being the forefather of the modern Japanese detective novel, he was hugely popular in his own country, with his private detective, the scruffy, cerebral Kosuke Kindaichi, appearing in films, TV adaptations and graphic novels, as well as 77 books. Kindaichi’s first outing, The Honjin Murders, originally published in 1946, has now been issued in English by Pushkin (translated by Louise Heal Kawai, £8.99). The plot, which revolves around a couple brutally killed on their wedding night in the winter of 1937, has plenty of golden age ingredients – a mysterious masked man, bloody handprints, heavy snowfall obscuring footprints and a plethora of confusing clues – and a truly ingenious solution."
17,crime,Calm With Horses review – crime and brutal punishment in rural Ireland,"The musician and actor Cosmo Jarvis looks eerily like a young Marlon Brando in this brutal gothic-realist drama set in the west of Ireland, directed by feature first-timer Nick Rowland. Adapted by screenwriter Joe Murtagh from a short story by Colin Barrett in his prize-winning collection Young Skins, it’s a lowlife crime drama with a streak of tragedy, despair and irreverent black humour. It’s powerfully and pugnaciously acted, and horses are brought in – as animals often are in social-realist movies – as symbols of redemptive nobility. But I felt that in narrative terms it turned into a cul-de-sac of macho violence. Jarvis plays Douglas, a big and ferocious ex-boxer now employed as an enforcer by a firm of drug dealers. This is the Devers family: Paudi (Ned Dennehy) and his notionally more respectable brother Hector (David Wilmot). A young cousin of the Devers is Dympna (Barry Keoghan) who has brought Douglas into this line of work and it is his semi-official job to mind Douglas, to handle him and to make sure he shows up for whatever grisly task the brothers have set. Right now, Douglas has to beat up an old man who has raped Hector’s teenage niece Charlotte (Hazel Doupe), and he dispenses this punishment with considerable professionalism in an all-but-unwatchable scene. But his bosses aren’t satisfied with the level of pain meted out. Meanwhile, Douglas is experiencing a kind of self-awakening. He has a five-year-old son, Jack (Kiljan Moroney), by former partner Ursula (Niamh Algar); the boy has autism, and Ursula has to pester Douglas for the money to send their son to a special school. As his boy gets older, it dimly dawns on Douglas that he, too, has a condition himself: an inability to control his surges of rage and anxiety. Ursula knows that Jack is helped by sessions of horse-riding and suspects the same might be true for Douglas – which results in a tender and engaging scene. Douglas in his muddled way is trying to be a good dad, though is unsure how this could be achieved. But really, the language of this movie is fear and violence, peppered with some black-comic dialogue riffs between Dympna and Douglas. Perhaps the ending of the film is a little predicable, but a talented and well-directed cast keep this movie motoring along, and Jarvis is a fierce screen presence."
18,crime,Should making fun of naturists be classed as a hate crime?,"Name: Textiles. Age: They come in all ages. Appearance: Nice and warm. Are we talking about fabrics? No, just the people who wear them. You mean absolutely everyone? Not quite. Which constituency could it possibly exclude? Naturists. “Textiles” is a word they sometimes use to refer to the clothes-wearing majority. It doesn’t sound as if they mean it in a nice way. They don’t. “That’s not a term I particularly like,” says the head of British Naturism, Mark Bass, “because it is quite derogatory. It comes up in cases of confrontation.” Was he naked when he said it? He was not. He was on the Today programme, and, by his own admission, fully dressed. “Naturists do not expose themselves to the elements in this sort of weather,” he said. Where might I be able to witness one of these confrontations between nudists and textiles? There was a protest scheduled over the weekend, with textiles objecting to British Naturism’s annual nude family swim at Sandcastle Water Park in Blackpool. Some protesters felt it would be a magnet for paedophiles. What did British Naturism have to say about that? It said: “We have a robust child and vulnerable adults safeguarding policy. It was developed in conjunction with the NSPCC and is reviewed annually.” A solid answer. Also, it wants anti-naturist abuse to be classed as a hate crime. That’s going a bit far, isn’t it? Not according to Bass. “These days, we all agree that shouting abuse at somebody because of the colour of their skin, their sexual preference or their religion is not acceptable,” he said. “Yet naturists still receive that type of abuse based on their dress code.” Or lack thereof … British Naturism contends that the lifestyle is protected by the Equalities Act. “Naturism is very much a philosophical belief,” said Bass. “It’s a belief that directs our lives and our choices.” Unless it’s cold outside. But even when it’s warm, you can’t just go about naked. There’s no actual law against nudity in the UK. What about us textiles? Does the Equalities Act protect me from being abused for wearing garments? Has that ever happened to you? Yes, when I wore my “Hail Satan” T-shirt to a departmental strategy meeting. It was laundry day. You know what? You may have a case. Do say: “When will the naked and the clothed learn to live in peace?” Don’t say: “Textile? Honey, please – it’s cashmere.”"
19,crime,Sun! Samba! Street crime! Red-faced Rio highlights the negative,"When marketing Rio de Janeiro, Brazil’s national tourism agency typically focuses on the city’s world-class beaches, samba-filled music scene and caipirinha-fueled parties. Violent crime is rarely listed among the attractions. But in an embarrassing social media cock-up this week, Embratur, the Brazilian tourist board, accidentally shared a critical Instagram post from a tourist who did not enjoy her stay in the so-called “Cidade Maravilhosa,” or Marvellous City. The Instagram post started promisingly enough – “Rio is such a beautiful city” – but it quickly took a darker turn. “I just spent three days in Rio with my family, and in those three days my family and I were robbed and my nine-year-old sister witnessed a violent robbery”.  The disgruntled visitor concluded: “I can’t recommend a visit to a city where I felt afraid of even leaving the apartment.” Embratur deleted the shared post on Wednesday. It said in a subsequent statement that “sharing [the post] was a mistake,” adding that it had worked hard to promote a nationwide fall in crime in 2019. Safety concerns along with inconvenient flights, poor infrastructure and high costs have long held back Brazil’s tourism industry, which lags behind its South American neighbours. As news of the mistake went viral, withlai, who identified herself as a Brazilian living in Europe, said in another Instagram post that she hoped “the person [at Embratur] doesn’t get in trouble, we all make mistakes.”"
20,crime,Villain review – tough Brit crime thriller shows a bit of class,"If you were just judging this film by its cast (a mix of EastEnders and Casualty alumni and barely knowns, with Craig Fairbrass in the lead), its cheesy marketing materials, and the barebones pitch (ex-con tries to go straight but is dragged down by his shiftless brother), hopes would not be high for this British crime thriller. Indeed, with its downbeat narrative trajectory, substantial helpings of violence, and high frequency use of the naughtiest of swearwords, this certainly feels like another outer-borough-set wodge of slicey-dicey post-pub entertainment. But sometimes a seemingly unprepossessing genre film comes along that has finer qualities than you would expect. Such is the case here. Directed by former actor Philip Barantini and written by Greg Hall and George Russo (who also co-stars as the seedy brother), this has refined touches throughout, starting with the slightly distorted sound design and brooding, unsettling score by Aaron May and David Ridley. Fine use is made of Fairbrass as ex-con Eddie, an actor who makes up with charisma and commitment what he might lack in range. He’s been playing these sort of hardmen for donkey’s years, but recently he’s started bringing different colours to his palette. In this case, it’s a mournful fatalism; in the recent feature Muscle, it was an unexpected strain of sleaziness and carnality. He used to be the poor casting director’s Vinnie Jones, but he’s proving to be a more interesting, versatile performer with every feature. On the downside, genre cliches are sprinkled throughout, and the female parts are poorly written. Nevertheless, Izuka Hoyle impresses as Eddie’s estranged daughter who really lets rip with the emoting in the final minutes; and Eloise Lovell Anderson manages to make something of her role as a drug-addled stripper girlfriend. • Villain is released in the UK on 28 February.

21,crime,Book clinic: Which thrillers and crime fiction will keep my teenager hooked?,"Q: My son is 17 and loves thrillers and crime novels. Can you recommend some classics that might appeal to him and some new titles, too?Anonymous mother, Leicestershire A: Peter Swanson is a thriller writer, whose latest novel, Rules for Perfect Murders, is published by Faber (£12.99). He writes: Nothing makes me happier than hearing about a young reader who loves crime novels. I was once that 17-year-old, obsessed with books and mostly drawn to tales of suspense. And while these days I have trouble remembering what I watched on television last night, I do remember the books I read when I was a teenager, at least the ones that made a big impression. My favourites from that time were, in no particular order, the supremely chilling Rosemary’s Baby by Ira Levin, the nonstop action thriller First Blood by David Morrell (better than the movie), and anything by Agatha Christie, but especially her masterpiece And Then There Were None. My favourite series character was the Boston-based private investigator Spenser, written by Robert Parker. I particularly recommend the seventh book in the series, Early Autumn. Spenser is drawn into an ugly divorce case, and bonds with the teenage boy caught in the middle of it all. It’s a great example of how a detective story can also be an emotional journey. I loved it as a teenager and read it many times.   Related: The best recent thrillers – review roundup     Other classics? Can’t go wrong with Dick Francis; I just reread Bonecrack and it was one of his best. And your son might enjoy Donna Tartt’s The Secret History, about freshmen at a New England college who kill one of their classmates. It’s wintry, sinister and romantic, and if it had existed when I was 17 years old, I would have been obsessed. There are plenty of terrific modern thrillers out there, too. He might know Anthony Horowitz as the creator of the Alex Rider books, but Horowitz writes brilliant adult thrillers as well. I can recommend both Moriarty and The Word Is Murder. If he’d like something a little edgier, The Shining Girls by Lauren Beukes is about a serial killer who travels through time. And there’s always Stephen King, if your son hasn’t dipped his toe in those waters yet. His book about the JFK assassination, 11.22.63, was a suspense masterpiece.

22,crime,Zola review – stylish viral tweet-based sex and crime caper,"The story of Zola seduced the attention of the internet back in 2015 not only because of its high quotient of narrative left turns and lurid details, but because it showed the hitherto unseen power of Twitter as a tool for compelling longform storytelling. In the space of about 148 tweets, Detroit waitress Aziah “Zola” Wells spun a staggering tale of a trip to Florida that went horribly wrong with conviction and wit sparking the interest of Hollywood with an impassioned battle for rights. Initially James Franco won out but the production was shelved after accusations of sexual misconduct and the following year, the indie director Janicza Bravo came onboard, a development that seems all the more like kismet given both the subject matter and the importance of a woman of colour being given the reins.   Related: Miss Americana review – Taylor Swift doc is too stage-managed to truly sing    It’s a tale that seemed too juicy to be true and after some digging at the time, it was discovered to be partly a fabrication, something both the real Zola and the film admit to, a knowing play to an audience willing to suspend disbelief in order to be entertained with a far-fetched string of events. But the basis of the story remains true even if some of the names have been changed. Zola (Taylour Paige) meets Stefani (Riley Keough) while serving her at a restaurant and the two hit it off. When Stefani invites her on a road trip to Florida, with the express purpose of making considerable money dancing, she jumps at the chance. Arriving to pick her up isn’t just Stefani but her awkward boyfriend Derrek (Nicholas Braun, AKA Cousin Greg from Succession) and a mysterious unnamed friend (Colman Domingo). There’s a sense of adventure in the early stages of the journey but as they get closer, Zola starts to question exactly who she’s travelling with and as the night gets underway, she finds herself trapped in a dangerous game of prostitution, pimps and murder. What keeps us glued during the first act isn’t just Zola’s sensationalist story but Bravo’s unexpected directorial choices. There’s inevitable grit but she chooses magical over social realism, framing the story like a fucked up fairy tale complete with a dreamy Mica Levi score, punctuated by the sounds of Twitter. The script, co-written by Bravo and Slave Play playwright Jeremy O’Harris, also retains the humour of the original thread, again framing an increasingly dark story with a light touch. There’s a wholly different way to make Zola, as a harrowing cautionary tale, but the pair rightfully decide to tell it for the most part with a wink. It would have also been too easy to rely on gaudy aesthetics to accompany Zola’s descent but instead Bravo has enlisted cinematographer Ari Wegner, known for her stark work on Lady Macbeth and the second season of The Girlfriend Experience and there’s a delicate push and pull from them both as they successfully capture a seedy underworld yet sustain a distinctive artfulness. Bravo is an accomplished hand and her stylistic choices, which often come right out of left field, avoid gimmickry for the most part. It’s a bold calling card even if the script isn’t always quite as confident, because at a swift 90 minutes, the film has some pacing issues. There’s an unstructured messiness to the plotting which I initially liked, sticking true to reality or at least the heightened reality that Zola created for us in her original thread, and for the first half we’re locked in – but near the final act, attention drifts. It’s not exactly the wild ride some might expect (and some on Twitter have been claiming with Uncut Gems and Spring Breakers not proving to be entirely fitting comparisons) with Bravo choosing to contrast the story’s eccentricities with a sometimes mundane look at the lives on show. There’s not a great deal of plot to fill the time and instead as the film moves along, it’s both her eye-grabbing direction and her actors that sustain our interest. Keough has developed a knack for inhabiting chilly characters with an unknown nature, in last year’s Sundance horror The Lodge as well as the first season of The Girlfriend Experience, but here she opts for the opposite, loudly presenting herself as a cocksure stripper-cum-prostitute with an uncomfortably affected accent, speaking in a specifically problematic way that irks Paige in one standout car scene. It’s Paige’s turn as Zola, an appalled observer, that’s the real star-maker here. She’s not only a fantastic dancer (with a background in ballet and as a regular on VH1’s cheerleading drama Hit the Floor) but she’s also a deftly understated comic performer. Her abrupt one-line reactions to the unravelling drama around her are pitched exquisitely but it’s her wordless facial responses that derive so much of the film’s humour. One hopes this launches her into an even higher bracket and with an upcoming role alongside Chadwick Boseman and Viola Davis in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, it seems like she’s already, deservedly on her way there. The Twitter-to-screen adaptation of Zola is as scrappy and imperfect as the original story but just as likable. There’s something unusually compelling about what Bravo does with the material that makes up for its missteps. It’s a bumpy ride but definitely one worth taking.  Zola is showing at the Sundance film festival with a release date yet to be confirmed "
23,crime,Knife crime at record high as overall charge rate falls,"The proportion of recorded crimes in England and Wales that resulted in a suspect being charged or summonsed to court has fallen again, figures reveal, as knife crime surges to a record high. In the year to March 2019, 7.8% of all recorded offences resulted in a charge or a summons, against 9.1% the previous year, figures on crime outcomes from the Home Office show. It continues a decline since the “crime outcomes” framework was introduced by the Home Office in March 2015 – when 15% of recorded crimes resulted in a charge or summons. Police forces closed almost half (44%) of offences with no suspect being identified, a similar proportion to last year, the figures showed.   Guardian graphic.   The figures were released after the Office for National Statistics (ONS) published its quarterly crime statistics, revealing a 7% rise in offences involving knives or sharp instruments in the year ending September to 44,771 offences, the highest on record. However, there was no change in the number of overall violent offences. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said: “This is a damning indictment of 10 years of Tory neglect of policing and the effect of cuts. The increase in the number of knife crime offences leaves them at an all-time high, and charge rates are at a low. “It is far from clear that the government will meet its own target for recruiting extra officers. It is certain they will not address some of the underlying causes of crime because they don’t even intend to. “This government cannot ensure the safety of our citizens is given the correct priority unless it changes course dramatically.” The drop in charges and summonses and rising knife crime come amid dwindling police resources. Boris Johnson has pledged to restore police numbers to levels seen before the Conservative party ushered in nine years of austerity. The National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for crime, Ch Con Andy Cooke, said: “The further fall in charging rates is concerning, but not surprising. In the past decade, we’ve dealt with more complex crimes and increasing demand while our resources fell. Changes to crime recording mean we now record more crimes that have no realistic prospect of conviction, which also affects the statistics. “With 20,000 new police officers coming in the next three years we will be more proactive and target persistent criminals who inflict misery on our communities.”   Guardian graphic.   The Home Office figures also revealed a drop in the number and proportion of offences resolved by out-of-court resolutions, while the proportion of offences that were closed as a result of “evidential difficulties” increased from 29% to 32%. The ONS’s Crime Survey of England and Wales, which measures prevalence of crime, showed there were no statistically significant changes in total crime. Murder and manslaughter was down 6%, burglary was down 4% and there was no change in levels of violence or theft, while there were increases in robbery, vehicle offences and fraud. Kit Malthouse, the minister for policing, crime and the fire service, said: “Overall, the numbers are extremely concerning. While there has been some reduction in murder and the crime survey shows a flat picture, violent crime is still too high.  “We are throwing everything we have got at this issue, recruiting 20,000 more officers and taking a smarter, more assertive approach to fighting crime. We all have to work together to win this fight and we won’t stop until we do.” "
24,crime,Hive heists: why the next threat to bees is organized crime,"Mike Potts was aware he was at risk of being a victim of crime, he just didn’t think it would happen to him. But Potts is an owner of an increasingly valuable commodity that thieves are targeting with growing sophistication in the US: bees. A booming demand for honeybees for pollination drew Potts, owner of Pottsy’s Pollination in Oregon, to load 400 hives of his bees on trucks and drive them down to California’s agricultural heartland last month. He unloaded them to a holding area just outside Yuba City and returned just a few days later to find 92 hives had been whisked away by thieves. “I pulled in the yard and noticed that there was some stuff missing,” said Potts, who estimated the theft cost him $44,000. Police subsequently pulled over three suspicious beekeepers traveling late at night, to no avail. “I’ve heard that there had been some stealing but didn’t think it would happen to me. It’s frustrating because it’s getting harder and harder to keep bees alive. And then you transport them down and they just get taken.” The theft is the latest in a string of beehive heists, often undertaken at the dead of night using forklifts and trucks. Hives are regularly split open or dismantled, interventions that can kill tens of thousands of the kidnapped bees. The problem has become severe enough in California that certain police officers now specialize in hive crime.     Bees enter a nest habitat in Sebastopol, California. Photograph: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters    “Hive theft has always been an issue but it has definitely increased over the last eight years,” said Rowdy Freeman, a Butte county police officer who is commonly referred to as “bee theft detective”. Freeman has compiled figures showing there was an explosion in California hive thefts in 2016, with 1,695 being taken, compared with 101 in 2015. In 2017, the figure was 1,048 hives. “The number fluctuates but it is definitely something that will continue and that will require resources and advancements in the use of technology to help prevent and deter theft.” The center of beehive thefts is California’s Central Valley, a fertile stretch of agricultural land responsible for about a quarter of all the produce grown in the US. This huge output – of lettuce, grapes, lemons, apricots and more – requires pollination from far more bees than naturally live in the area. The main driver of the demand for honeybees is the almond industry, which has doubled in size over the past two decades. There are currently 1.17m acres of almonds in California that require pollination which, at a standard rate of two beehives an acre, means the industry somehow needs to conjure up 2.34m beehives for a short window of time each February, when almond trees start to blossom. Beekeepers from across the US congregate in the Central Valley in a sort of annual almond jamboree; more than two-thirds of the nation’s commercially managed honeybees sent on trucks to a 50-mile-wide strip of fertile land. Unlike native, wild bees like bumblebees, honeybees are carefully marshaled in hives and are now more valuable as contract pollination workers than as honey producers. But the almond industry’s growth is heightening the demand for more bees at a time when even maintaining current numbers is a struggle. Due to the ravages of deadly mites, diseases and toxic pesticides, beekeepers now typically lose 40% of their colonies each winter, only making these numbers up through splitting hives and using various treatments and supplements to boost reproduction rates. This dynamic – growing demand for pollinators at a time when supply is under pressure – has seen the typical cost of a hive for pollination shoot up, from just $35 a few years ago to $200, and upwards, now. Pollination has become big business, causing some desperate beekeepers, or organized gangs, to be drawn to beehive crime. “Normal people can’t just go steal 500 hives with a forklift and a truck,” said Charley Nye, a beekeeper researcher at University of California, Davis. “So it’s a pretty small pool of people that are able to steal them. But the reward is so big that I think it can be tempting to people to do that.”     Charley Nye: ‘Normal people can’t just go steal 500 hives with a forklift and a truck.’ Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo    Lloyd Cunniff, who has been involved in beekeeping since he was 13 years old, never intended to bring his bees to the Central Valley, where endless rows of almond trees stretch out across the landscape in almost every direction. But Cunniff, now 59, had seen his third-generation apiary in Montana decimated by colony collapse disorder – a mysterious syndrome where the worker bees vacate a hive en masse – and needed the income. In January 2017, he loaded 488 beehives, each handmade in distinctive pine and cedar, and headed west. Through a trusted intermediary, Cunniff set his hives down to rest in a remote area near a levee. As is typical in the beekeeping world, there were no fences or other security systems to protect them. The next day, amid heavy fog, Cunniff went back to find them. “We had a GPS reading and we drove out there and my hired man said: ‘There’s your turn.’ And I turned in there and I said: ‘This can’t be the right turn.’ And he said: ‘Why?’ I said: ‘Because there’s no bees sitting,’” Cunniff recalled. “And I thought, ‘Uh-oh.’” All 488 boxes had gone, quickly and skillfully loaded on to a truck and spirited away, costing Cunniff not just the $100,000 in pollination fees but also the basis of his livelihood. He wasn’t to know, but he was just one of many victims of a well-orchestrated operation. Not long after the theft, police were called to a scruffy field near Fresno where they saw something akin to bee carnage. Beehives were scattered randomly across the land, some open with their innards torn out, others scratched and daubed in paint. An irate swarm of bees made officers wary of exiting their cars.    It was like a chop shop for bees ... And there were a lot of aggressive bees  Det Andres Solis     “It was like a chop shop for bees,” said Andres Solis, a Fresno detective who specializes in agricultural crime. “None of the boxes matched, it was really untidy. And there were a lot of aggressive bees.” Police called in beekeepers who estimated there were 2,500 hives belonging to a variety of legal owners. A nearby man, Pavel Tveretinov, was arrested under suspicion that he was hacking up the hives in order to multiply them and sell them on to needy growers. An alleged accomplice, Vitaliy Yeroshenko, was also arrested and both now face trial. “Victims started coming out of the woodwork after we started putting it out there,” Solis said. “We looked at what we saw and thought none of these beehives belonged to these gentlemen.” The overall number of thefts dropped following the arrests but beekeepers are concerned that the ballooning demand for honeybees is only going to spur further criminal enterprises. The fallout from the ecological crisis in the bee, and wider insect, world is likely to include more and more bee rustlers. “There’s a shortage of bees this year, again,” Cunniff said. “You watch in this next week or two, there’s going to be stealing of bees like crazy down here. “It was just my turn. That’s how I look at it because it happens to somebody every year down here. They’re stealing them all the time. It’s just going to keep getting bigger and bigger.”"
25,crime,EU clamps down on free ports over crime and terrorism links,"Brussels is clamping down on 82 free ports or free zones after identifying that their special tariff and duty status has aided the financing of terrorism, money laundering and organised crime. A set of new rules was introduced by the European commission just weeks before the launch on Monday of a UK government consultation on the creation of up to 10 free ports in post-Brexit Britain. Authorities across the EU have been obliged since 10 January to take extra measures to identify and report suspicious activities at the ports and zones as a result of the “high incidence of corruption, tax evasion, criminal activity”. The EU’s executive branch has said it will review the issue again next year owing to the popularity of such ports among high-net-worth individuals and criminal organisations seeking to circumvent recent crackdowns on bank secrecy.   Related: Government officials working on plans for bridge linking Scotland to Ireland, No 10 confirms – live news    Free ports or free zones are a type of special economic zone (SEZ) where business and trade laws differ from those in the rest of the country. Goods can be landed, stored, handled, manufactured or reconfigured and re-exported without being subject to customs duty. Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the UK Treasury, inaccurately claimed on Monday that “the EU is pretty much the only place in the world that doesn’t use free ports”. In reality, the EU’s customs code does allow for free ports or zones and there are 82 of them across the countries that are subject to its regulations. The Isle of Man, a British crown dependency that is neither part of the EU nor the UK, operates a free port. The British government has said it wants the first to be opened in the UK by 2021. In July, the commission said free ports, popular for the storage of art, precious stones, antiques, gold and wine as alternative assets to cash, posed an emerging threat in multiple ways. The ports are said to allow counterfeiters to land consignments, tamper with loads or associated paperwork and re-export the products without customs intervention, disguising the true origin and nature of the goods, and the identity of the original supplier. The commission said they were also used for narcotics trafficking, the illegal ivory trade, people smuggling, VAT fraud, corruption and money laundering. “Legal businesses owned by criminals remain key to money-laundering activities”, the report said. “Free ports are perceived as facilities that protect their clients’ identity and financial dealings, much as private banks used to.” As an example of the nefarious activities taking place at such sites, the commission noted that in December 2016, Swiss authorities seized cultural relics looted from Syria, Libya and Yemen that were being stored in Geneva’s free ports. “The looters had brought the confiscated objects to Switzerland via Qatar”, the EU report said. “Three of the pieces were from the ancient city of Palmyra, a Unesco world heritage site systematically destroyed by [Islamic State] jihadists who had seized it in May 2015.” “Free ports are conducive to secrecy,” the report added. “With their preferential treatment, they resemble offshore financial centres, offering a high degree of security and discretion, and permitting transactions without attracting the attention of regulators or direct tax authorities.” The British government has argued that the proposed new zones could bring thousands of new jobs and significant investment but the conclusions of trade experts have been mixed. A report from the UK Trade Policy Observatory suggested the benefits would be “tiny”, while the construction group Mace argued the creation of free ports could create 150,000 new jobs and add £9bn a year to the UK economy. A report from the European parliament last year noted that a growing demand for free ports could in part be explained by a recent global crackdown on tax evasion. The US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and the OECD’s 2014 Common Reporting Standard (CRS) make it hard for individuals to escape taxation on proceeds of funds held in bank accounts."
26,crime,McDonald and Dodds review – mismatched cops are the perfect partners in crime,"‘I’m here for two years, tops, so don’t get attached to me,” says DCI Lauren McDonald (Tala Gouveia) at the start of McDonald and Dodds (ITV). Which is no way to launch a TV cop franchise, but still. “But, while I’m here, I’m gonna solve cases in half the time with half the manpower.” Talking about it won’t make it happen. Imagine Simon Pegg from Hot Fuzz as a crime-solving woman of colour with sarcastic eyebrows and you’ll get the picture. McDonald has been transferred from south London’s mean streets to Bath, a city where the worst crimes are usually the prices for cream teas. Well, not quite. There’s a corpse at a millionaire’s mansion, plugged with two slugs from a military-issue sidearm. Despite the panama hat and expensive shirt, the vic had prison tats and a rap sheet as long as the elegant Regency staircase down which he fell to his death. The mansion is owned by Robert Lindsay’s oleaginous entrepreneur, Max Crockett. He made a £30m fortune from making steam irons which, as one cop puts it, are “the best things to come out of Bath since Plasticine”. Plasticine was indeed invented in Bath by William Harbutt. No, not William Hardbutt. He invented chair cushions. Crockett is planning to retire. But to which of his three daughters will he leave his fortune? If the premise sounds like King Lear or Succession, let me say this: Brian Cox didn’t give anything away in Succession. And is Crockett’s artisanal-baker daughter, Ellie, who does such a good Cordelia impression all she seems? Not if I know my crime dramas she isn’t. Whodunnit? “Most murder victims are killed by a member of their own family,” McDonald tells the Crocketts. “Maybe where you come from. But not here,” scoffs Crockett’s Goneril-like daughter, Megan, who is not only vice-chair of Bath’s police oversight committee, but the answer to the question: “Who ate all the lemons?” “We’re nice, middle-class people who go glamping,” says her no-less-citrus-filled barrister husband. “We play boules at the weekend. Where are we going to get a firearm?” McDonald rightly figures she has a family of suspects, all with motives, but no alibis. But how is she going to prove some or all of them are guilty before the sixth and final ad break? Step forward her new partner, DS Dodds. Like Morse, if he has a first name no one has used it for decades. Dodds hasn’t been deployed in a non-desk-related crime scenario for 11 years. The brass so want him to take early retirement that they have put his desk under the air-conditioning, which means he has to wear a scarf. Monsters. I don’t want to endorse the stereotype that Dodds is pale, male and stale, but he wears a tie under a tank top, which is so wrong I don’t know where to start. He may have eyebrows, but they are sneaky ones, so blond that they pass unnoticed on his pasty face. As a result, Jason Watkins, who plays Dodds, has to use not his eyebrows but minimal eye movement to suggest his character’s default mode of existential bewilderment. Watkins was so adorable as W1A’s floral-shirted BBC drone who was literally good for nothing but folding Hugh Bonneville’s Brompton (not a euphemism) that he surprises here as someone with unexpected professional gifts. Dodds breaks the case by spotting a peregrine falcon near the Crockett mansion. Its nest in a nearby church tower, he realises, will be ringed with RSPB-installed cameras, which will show who broke in to the Crocketts’ mansion and offed the stiff. “Good work with the penguin falcon,” says McDonald, still not convinced her new partner isn’t a chump. “Peregrine,” he corrects, saddened by her ignorance of local fauna. The writer, Robert Murphy, has created a lovely double act. Not since Felix Unger tried to vacuum Oscar Madison’s drapes (again, not a euphemism) have I enjoyed the venerable trope of the odd couple so much. Don’t get attached? Too late, ma’am. I already am."
27,crime,"Westpac knew anti-crime provisions were inadequate years ago, MPs told","Westpac knew its ability to fight financial crime was inadequate two years before legal action in November in which authorities accused it of 23m breaches of the law that included allowing customers to pay for child exploitation in the Philippines, federal parliament has heard. The bank’s risk of breaching anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism finance (AML-CTF) laws was unacceptably high and the bank accepted it needed to improve its systems, the prudential regulator was told in a secret report delivered by accounting firm EY in 2017. On Friday, Labor senator Deborah O’Neill read out sections of the report during a committee inquiry into auditors, steamrolling through objections from Westpac executives and warnings from the chair of the committee, Liberal James Paterson.   Related: Australian banking ends a year from hell as 'the face of unconscionable greed'    O’Neill also blasted Westpac for refusing to give the committee a list of documents she requested on 28 January, and only informing the committee of its position at 6.30pm on Thursday night. The report was prepared by EY for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra) so that Westpac could comply with a prudential standard, CPS 220, that requires it to have systems in place to monitor and mitigate its risk. O’Neill said: “EY’s overall conclusion was the design of Westpac’s risk management framework was overall adequate, appropriate and partially effective for an institution of the size and complexity of Westpac.” However, EY found that “risk identification, assessment and management of non-financial risk was evaluated as partially effective and partially adequate”. “Westpac has noted that financial crime is an area that requires improvement,” she said, reading from the report. She continued: “The risk of breaching AML-CTF obligations has at times been outside of appetite and we observe there have been issues across several jurisdictions reflecting heightened regulatory expectations and an acknowledgment by Westpac that its current AML-CTF capabilities require improvement.” “Outside of appetite” is a term meaning that the risk of a breach of the law was higher than management of the bank was willing to accept. “Westpac are investing in the roll-out of a new transaction monitoring system … to enhance its financial crime capability,” O’Neill said, again reading from the report. Westpac’s chief risk officer, David Stephen, who was giving evidence to the hearing, repeatedly complained that the report had been provided to the committee on a confidential basis. He and the acting chief financial officer, Gary Thursby, declined to answer most of O’Neill’s questions on the basis that Westpac was facing multiple investigations and lawsuits over the breaches. Australia’s financial intelligence agency, Austrac, launched federal court legal action against Westpac over the alleged breaches on 20 November last year, sending the bank’s share price into a steep decline. While most of the 23m breaches alleged by Austrac relate to its treatment of international funds transfer instructions, the regulator also alleged it failed to stop a dozen customers making more than 3,000 low-value payments to the Philippines that were consistent with child exploitation. These customers included six who had repeatedly travelled to the Philippines or south-east Asia and one who had a prior conviction for child abuse, Austrac said in court documents. The lawsuit resulted in the former chief executive Brian Hartzer, chairman Lindsay Maxsted and the non-executive director responsible for oversight of risk, Ewen Crouch, tendering their resignations. Thursby was elevated into his current role as a temporary replacement for Peter King, who is acting as CEO until a new boss is found. O’Neill savaged the bank over its lack of cooperation with the committee, saying that despite its ability to command legions of lawyers it had failed to make a proper application for public interest immunity against production of documents. “Your counsel simply doesn’t understand the rights of parliament to demand that information,” she told Stephen and Thursby. Stephen apologised for the lateness of Westpac’s letter on Thursday night.   Related: Westpac scandal: Apra launches full investigation into bank over child exploitation allegations    “With the benefit of hindsight that communication wasn’t appropriate,” he said. O’Neill had requested documents including all the drafts of the EY report, and information about remediation efforts following on from it. The drafts are potentially significant because the recent financial services royal commission heard allegations that AMP put pressure on law firm Clayton Utz to change a review it was conducting for the company. In its Thursday night letter, obtained by Guardian Australia, Westpac said it received a draft of the EY report on 30 June 2017 “to enable verification of the factual accuracy of the report”. It said it had “corrected factual inaccuracies” in the report, “sought clarification of the wording in the report where EY’s drafting was not clear or needed additional context” and provided “additional information and evidence to EY to ensure that their report and recommendations were based on a full assessment of Westpac’s current risk framework and practices”."
28,crime,"Extra officers must lead to less crime, Priti Patel tells police chiefs","The home secretary has signalled another U-turn on law and order with the return of Whitehall-set targets to cut crime and warned police there will be no excuses for failure. Priti Patel told the annual conference of police chiefs that the addition of 20,000 officers over three years as promised by government meant forces should rigorously “investigate every type of crime”. She said: “This extra injection of taxpayers’ cash must deliver the crime cuts the public desperately want. In three years’ time when the 20,000 additional officers are through the door, people must see a difference. Less crime, safer streets, no excuses. The public won’t accept them and neither should we.” Patel said a national policing board and a new crime and policing performance board would set “outcomes” on cutting serious crime and other offences. She also promised a cut in bureaucracy. Police chiefs see this as the return of nationally set targets introduced under New Labour and then derided by the Conservatives when they came to power in coalition with the Liberal Democrats in 2010. The Tories at that time said local communities should set priorities through elected police and crime commissioners rather than Whitehall. Police believed targets were too rigid and could skew priorities. Patel accepted confidence in the criminal justice system had fallen and there were fewer police visible on the streets. Charging rates had halved in four years, to 8% in 2018/9, she noted, and one police watchdog had said the public had “rumbled” that police were not investigating crimes such as car thefts, lower-level assaults and burglaries. Patel said: “We need to investigate every type of crime with the rigour the public expect.” She said the government had given police an unprecedented boost in resources and also new powers, and would back them in fighting crime. The government would demand reductions in murders, serious violence and neighbourhood crime, and improvements in victim satisfaction and diversity in the ranks, she told the conference. “These outcomes will be non-negotiable and I will be unapologetic about holding you to account.” Some of those listening criticised Patel. Labour’s Sophie Linden, the London deputy mayor for policing, who oversees the Metropolitan police, said: “It’s the return of nationally set targets. It’s the return of ‘Whitehall knows best’. We know from previous experience they skewed the way police can operate. They can be dangerous. They damaged public safety and confidence. She also forgot she was a member of the party that cut policing and she voted for the cuts.” Paddy Tipping, the Labour police and crime commissioner for Nottinghamshire, said the home secretary did not have the powers to order police what to do. “We don’t want to go back to targets. The legal powers belong to chiefs and PCCs,” he said. The chief inspector of constabulary, Sir Tom Winsor, addressing the conference after Patel, attacked the Conservatives’ record of cuts, which he said had blighted the police, courts and prisons and had left justice “extinguished in some cases”. Prisons were in chaos, the prosecution service plagued by “disgraceful” delays and courts hit by decay and left empty, he said. “So why did the criminal justice system come to this state. Funding cuts are the basic answer.” Dave Thompson, the West Midlands chief constable, said local services had been decimated, leaving police to pick up the pieces, especially in mental health. He said police had come “close to emptying the bins” instead of preventing or detecting crime as services were cut. Martin Hewitt, the chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, said the courts and prosecution service were under such strain that adding more police officers may fail to deliver big cuts in crime. “We can all see it’s [the criminal justice system] not coping now. It’s creaking and in places it’s breaking. More importantly, it’s letting down victims and leaving criminals to walk free,” he said. “Without serious change, more policing won’t mean more justice. And more policing without more justice is a recipe for corroding legitimacy – both in us as the police and in all parts of the system.”"
29,crime,Ball-tampering reverberations endure as Australia return to scene of the crime,"In the early hours of Thursday morning Australian time, Steve Smith and David Warner return to Newlands in Cape Town to take on South Africa in a cricket match. As benign as it seems, the event will mark nearly two years since the sandpaper imbroglio tore viciously at Australian cricket’s cultural seams, sparking a wave of invective, reflection and – it would appear – rehabilitation: public and private, institutional and individual. Although most Australians were asleep when it happened, in the pantheon of cricket crises the sandpaper affair landed in the “I remember where I was when I found out” realm. Given the sheer onslaught of content this century, such a phenomenon is worth pointing out. For this author, it was an antenatal class in north London, ducking to the bathroom four or five times to read dispatches while our midwife delivered subtly editorialised views on the dangers of NHS doctors “intervening” in the birth.   Related: David Warner last man standing as Australia collapse in South Africa T20 defeat    But where our doctor successfully intervened, Australia’s spin doctors unfortunately did not. The press conference coverup added to the crime, and the issue metastasised. After texting an ex-pro about the incident at the time, the reply came: “It’s nowhere near the worst ball tampering I’ve seen, but it’s definitely the dumbest.” The reaction was seismic. To put it in context, around Melbourne locals with a dash of self-awareness remember the time when its major tabloid devoted more pages to the Wayne Carey affair in March 2002 than it did September 11 in 2001, so consumed was the city with its game. If it were possible, this was bigger and, unlike the vast majority of AFL tales, it was global. It led the news in the UK, which at the time was dealing with Brexit, Cambridge Analytica, and Russian spies using nerve agents. But for a few days, “Aussie Cheats” took top billing, and had outlets such as the BBC combing the country for Australian cricket pundits, most of whom were in South Africa. As a result, at one point a retired Australian district cricketer fronted shows to provide special comments, such was the hunger for a human piñata. The chief question was: “Why do Aussies so often cheat?” To believe the sandpaper scandal was an overstated moral panic in response to ball tampering – which many people still do – would be to misunderstand it. The event became less about the specific indiscretion than it was the straw that broke the camel’s back for a public weary of the ceaseless sneer and charmlessness of the men playing at the highest level of the country’s national sport. It was a lightning rod for the general behaviour of Australian cricketers which had sat simmering for decades, and then boiled over under Darren Lehmann – the arch-alpha who in the 24 months since Cape Town has coached with Australia’s national performance squad before taking a role with Brisbane Heat in March 2019. To simply fast forward two years would be to disregard the subsequent public bloodletting, which was followed by a painstaking process of wound-healing. Central to it has been an arm-wrestle and recalibration on each of Smith and Warner, who have re-entered the side undiminished as batsmen but diminished as leaders. Attitudes toward them both differ, as they always did. A Stuart Broad-dismantling aside, Warner has returned with energy and runs, but this time devoid of any overt brand, whether it be The Reverend or The Bull. There were rumours he may not have been welcome back in the national side, but for Justin Langer’s insistence. No doubt 21 Test centuries helped his case, to which he’s added another three – one of them a triple. If there has been any rebrand, it has been as a family man who appears unconcerned with pining for the affection of both public or teammates. He simply enjoys scoring siege-mentality runs, and is at peace with his natural abrasion and resting Bull face. Also, there remains an official version of events at Newlands to which everyone is happy to subscribe, for now. Welcoming Warner back might therefore have proven a smart move, given that any attempt to ostracise him might have invited a nuclear reaction.   Related: 'I don't have his number': David Warner has no plans to clear air with Quinton de Kock    In contrast, the events of Cape Town have chiselled Smith from Australia’s generational chief – following Border, Waugh, Ponting and Clarke before him – to something more akin to a batting savant. In the intervening period, as skipper Tim Paine has demonstrated the soft power benefits of possessing a polished diplomatic touch, without compromising on the relentlessness and ruthlessness required to win Tests. It’s a contrast that puts a fine point on Smith’s blind spot when originally in the role, and it’s not unreasonable to question the wisdom of any Smith reappointment on this basis. Through the trial, turnover, and tears of sandpaper-gate, Australian cricket has endured its dip and is now clearly headed north, both on the field and off. Everybody associated with the farrago was clearly humbled by the experience, but its reverberations still endure. Having bustled themselves into a new era of pre-game handshakes, PG sledging and earthing, the most pressing cultural question now is: how real is this behaviour, and will it be observed should Australia ascend to the top of world cricket again?"
30,crime,Crewe's David Artell: 'I did a helluva lot on crime-scene analysis',"Daytime television can be deemed dreary but, in David Artell’s case, tuning into a couple of timeless crime dramas after training, while a young professional at his hometown club Rotherham United, proved the inspiration for his bachelors’ degree in forensic biology. “Around 2.25pm it was Diagnosis: Murder with Dick Van Dyke and then Murder, She Wrote with Jessica Fletcher and I thought: ‘Yeah, I’ll be good at that,’” says Artell. “I did think: ‘Why do I not tune into something better than the man off Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Jessica Fletcher? But I found them interesting and it all started from there.” Not that there were too many parallels between his studies – which he started at Sheffield Hallam in 2003 and finished at the University of Chester in 2010, encompassing a postgraduate certificate in biomedical sciences – and those storylines on the sofa. “I suppose it’s a bit like saying Poirot or Midsomer Murders is like being a detective inspector,” the 39-year-old says. “I’m pretty certain the high-ranking police officers of this world do not think Midsomer is anything like a normal sleepy town. It was chalk and cheese, I have to say.”   Related: Rather than ranting about VAR, why not focus on tackling game's real problems | Jonathan Liew    Which topics did he tackle at university? “We did a helluva lot on crime-scene analysis: how do you recover a footprint in the snow? From a drop of blood, how do you get a DNA profile? What if you’ve only got a portion of DNA and you have to magnify that portion; all different techniques, in terms of recovering DNA. And then hair samples, semen samples, fingerprints on glass. How do you get fingerprints off glass? Is it just taping or can you take the glass away and do something called superglue fuming, to pull the fingerprint off with all the proteins? Then you have a negative impression so you have to go back and get the actual fingerprint. Then you look for 14 individual marks. It was really interesting, a lot of stuff on genetics, which was absolutely unbelievably brilliant. It was just fascinating. Biology of disease.” These days Artell has different conundrums to solve as the manager of Crewe Alexandra, who are second in League Two, two points off the summit. The former defender spent two seasons at the club as a player after three years at Saturday’s opponents Morecambe and made his international debut for Gibraltar, where his father, Greg, was born, at the age of 34, going on to play against then world champions Germany in Nuremberg while he was on the books of the Welsh Premier League club Bala Town. “The night before we were all thinking we’re going to get absolutely tonked, that it could be double figures. As it turned out, we only got beat 4-0, which sounds bad but they beat Brazil 7-1 a few months before. Did we get out of our half? Well, we did once. We got a corner just before half-time. Myself and another lad were running up and Thomas Müller turned to us and said: ‘This is your big chance,’” Artell says in his best German accent. “We were howling and when the ball came in from the corner, we were still laughing. He [Müller] was a brilliant sport.”     Paul Green, here celebrating after scoring against Barnsley in the FA Cup, is one of the experienced heads in a young Crewe team. Photograph: Lewis Storey/Getty Images    Artell is articulate but modest and believes his seven international caps were a reward for his work ethic – “I couldn’t run very fast, but I was a grafter” – and, as a manager, he is equally tireless in his pursuit to evolve. He listens to podcasts en route to training – Masterminds and Price of Football – and is a keen reader, particularly on development and psychology, reeling off The Nowhere Men, The Talent Code and Moneyball. Artell, who also owns a tax consultancy company, is on the LMA diploma in football management. “I’m not trying to be self-righteous or big headed, but I’ve just got a thirst for learning. If you learn all the time, you will always stay ahead of your curve. I think you have to do that to stay ahead of others. I just think knowledge is the bomb – maybe that sounds cliché – but the more knowledge you have, the better decisions you will make over a period of time. Do I transfer forensic biology or biomedical science into football? There are certainly crossovers, but more at a cellular level. When the sports scientist is talking to me, I can talk to him about heat shock proteins and if he has done any blood tests to test whether anybody is under stress. There is a commonality that helps.”     The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.   Artell is one of the youngest managers in the country but hardly the new kid on the block; he is the ninth-longest-serving manager in the Football League. At Crewe, whose reputation Artell previously acknowledged has taken “one helluva battering” in recent years owing to the Barry Bennell scandal, he has built a vibrant team to be proud of. Will Jääskeläinen, the eldest son of the former Bolton goalkeeper Jussi, has seized his chance in goal, while Perry Ng, the 23-year-old captain, has been outstanding at right-back and the England Under-19 forward Stephen Walker, on loan from Middlesbrough, scored his first goal for the club in victory over Macclesfield last weekend. The average age of the starting XI was 23.6 years, including Chris Porter, the 36-year-old striker. “We’ve got three, what I call ‘Dad’s Army lads’,” Artell says, in reference to Porter, Nicky Hunt, 36, who played in the Premier League with Bolton, and Paul Green, 36, the former Republic of Ireland midfielder. Crewe have won their five of their past six matches and have a return to League One in their sights after a four-year absence. “We are pleased with where we are and reaping the rewards of foundations we laid over the last few years. It has taken us two or three years to develop players to get to this level and hopefully we can have a strong end to the season.” Talking points • The Championship’s form teams meet on Tuesday, when West Brom host Preston. Victory for Slaven Bilic’s side would extend their lead at the summit to seven points and apply pressure on Leeds, who are at Middlesbrough on Wednesday, while Preston’s manager, Alex Neil – courted by West Brom in April, knows three points would go some way to cementing their play-off credentials. The top two play each other in League One, with Rotherham hosting Coventry.• Hull host Barnsley on Wednesday aware they can ill afford to give further encouragement to the teams beneath them. Hull are winless since New Year’s Day and on a wretched run of seven defeats in nine matches. The return of Jordy de Wijs and Reece Burke should ease their defensive frailties but allowing Jarrod Bowen and Kamil Grosicki to depart in January may come back to bite.

31,crime,Female fugitives: why is 'pink-collar crime' on the rise?,"Men commit more crimes than women do. A lot more. This holds true over time and across cultures. In America, the incarceration capital of the world (more than 2 million detainees), males comprise 93% of the prison population. Men also account for 73% of all arrests and 80% of those charged with violent crimes. This disparity between the sexes is particularly stark when it comes to murder: 90% of the time, the ones who do the killing are men. All these numbers add up to what criminologists call the “gender gap”. But read enough academic journals and government crime reports, and some curious facts emerge: while crime rates in the western world have steadily declined over the past three decades, the number of young women being convicted for violent crimes in some western countries has increased significantly; law enforcement records indicate the opposite is true for their male counterparts. In other words, the gender gap is closing. In some UK cities, the number of female arrests increased by 50% from 2015 to 2016. That’s more than a blip. A 2017 report by the Institute For Criminal Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London came up with this sobering data point: the global female prison population has surged by more than half since the turn of the century, while the male prison population increased by just a fifth over that same period. Women and girls may account for only 7% of all incarcerated people today, but their numbers are now growing at a much faster rate than at any time in recorded history.   series links   Kelly Paxton, a Portland, Oregon-based private investigator known as the Pink-Collar Crime Lady, says she isn’t surprised that female arrest rates are going up: “Women suddenly have the financial pressures that men have had for decades. They’re the breadwinners in 40% of all households. If these women can’t pay the bills, some will resort to committing crimes.” The new crime trend hasn’t gone unnoticed. The National Herald ran this story last month: Greek cops nab teen girl pickpocket ring in Athens. And here’s a recent BBC News headline: Sharp rise in women caught carrying knives (up 73% in the past five years). Even InSight Crime, a not-for-profit that studies organized crime in Latin America and the Caribbean, is all-in. One of their recent reports sounds like a Netflix elevator pitch: female prisoners in Venezuela become cell block bosses to survive. What’s really cemented this pulpy women-behind-bars image in the collective conscious, though, is Crime Has No Gender, a controversial Europol campaign that launched last August. “Are women equally capable of committing serious crimes as men?” reads the news release. “The female fugitives featured on Europe’s Most Wanted website prove that they are.”    Are women equally capable of committing serious crimes as men? The female fugitives featured on Europe's Most Wanted website prove that they are    To show that women can be vicious sociopaths too, Europol asked 21 of the 28 EU member countries to select a single fugitive for their campaign. The methodology may have been flawed, and the sample size small, but the gimmick worked. The bad girls theme was reflected in the head count: 18 females, three males. Elena Puzyrevich (Russia), who trafficked nine young women into Spain and forced them to work as prostitutes, made the list. So did Dorota Kazmierska (Poland), a 44-year-old femme fatale who killed her husband by shooting him in the head. Then there’s Zorka Rogic (Croatia), a blonde desperado who works in sales: narcotics, “psychotropic substances”, firearms, munitions and explosives. Documenting the rise in female crime is one thing. Explaining it is quite another. Cesare Lombroso, the Italian physician known as the “father of modern criminology” (he invented the first lie detector) also wrote the first book about women and crime, La Donna Delinquente, in 1893. He concluded that women who broke the law exhibited crude male traits. The profile was simple: short, lusty, vulgar and prone to wrinkles. They also had darker hair and smaller skulls than “normal” women. A Lombroso dating tip: beware of girls with prominent lower jaws – they’re likely to commit crimes of passion. Freud also thought criminal women were more like men. Sort of. He blamed female crime on a “masculinity complex”, which could be traced back to (of course) penis envy. Most women resolved this complex and developed into law-abiding citizens. Others, however, fared worse. Instead of embracing femininity, these women over-identified with males and coveted their floppy organs. Think of a woman who smiles while she stabs her husband to death in bed, and later cleans the sheets. Biology and psychology theories are still discussed in criminology classes today. Studies that link the menstrual cycle to female crime have persisted for decades. According to the three female authors of The Curse: A Cultural History of Menstruation, the 19th century axe murderer Lizzie Borden butchered her family because “her period coincided with an epileptic attack”. Psychology models, of course, continue to be popular. Behavioral theory suggests that becoming a criminal requires conditioning, a form of learning that involves positive reinforcement: rob a bank, spend the money, rob another bank.    According to three female authors axe murderer Lizzie Borden butchered her family because ""her period coincided with an epileptic attack""    Increasingly, though, many of today’s gender gap theories focus on external factors, like tougher drug sentencing laws (25% of women in US state prisons have been convicted of a drug offense, compared to 14% of male prisoners) and the proliferation of violent female gangs (the Bad Barbies, an all-girls “sister gang”, with chapters in Harlem and Brooklyn, have pulled off multiple revenge murders). There’s also the post-conviction barriers that uniquely affect women and lead to recidivism: prison guard abuse, few mental health services and a lack of job training. Police, lawyers and judges being less protective toward women is another reason criminologists believe the gender gap is shrinking. We should have seen this coming. In 1975, the famous criminologist Freda Adler trumpeted this warning in her bombshell book Sisters In Crime: The Rise of the New Female Criminal: “In the same way that women are demanding equal opportunity in the fields of legitimate endeavor, a similar number of determined women are forcing their way into the world of major crimes.” Forty-five years later, Adler’s feminist manifesto still resonates. Just try finding a criminologist who doesn’t own a dog-eared copy. Critics may argue that her prediction was wrong (the 70s women’s lib movement didn’t breed a vast army of females toting guns and flashing armpit hair), but Adler was onto something. More women are committing violent crimes. It just took longer than she expected. The most intriguing academic paper that explores the women behaving badly phenomenon is the 2015 article The Darker Side of Equality? The Declining Gender Gap in Crime. Rejecting Adler’s gender equality theory, the authors offer a reverse hypothesis: the real reason that the gender gap is shrinking isn’t because women are copying the behavior of men and committing more crimes – it’s because men are copying the behavior of women and committing fewer crimes. The idea that feminism might be making our mean streets safer may sound absurd to a beat cop, but the theory is being hotly debated among criminologists and gender studies scholars at liberal arts colleges. The Pink-Collar Crime Lady has her own gender gap theory, and it doesn’t have anything to do with feminism, chivalrous judges or menstrual cycles. “Women nurture and raise us. We love and trust them,” explains Kelly Paxton. “So being a female crook is the perfect cover.” Then she shares some insider wisdom: “The first thing I tell clients is never underestimate a woman. They’re ruthless.”"
32,crime,Wildland review – Danish crime drama with the makings of a big hit,"Danish film-maker Jeanette Nordahl has served her time as a second-unit director on TV’s Borgen. Now, presenting her debut feature at Berlin, she gives us an insidiously horrible and thrilling Scandi noir of her own – written by Ingeborg Topsøe. It exerts a nasty grip (the original Danish title is Kød &amp; Blod, or flesh and blood). After her addict mum accidentally kills herself in a car accident, the impassive 17-year-old Ida (a cracking performance from Sandra Guldberg Kampp) is told by stressed social services that she will have to move in with her aunt and her family. Her aunt is the cheerful, glamorous divorcee Bodil (Sidse Babett Knudsen) who lives in a handsome house with her youngest son Mads (Besir Zeciri): he does nothing all day except play video games and smoke dope. Her other son Jonas (Joachim Fjelstrup) often comes around with his partner and new baby, though Bodil has a trickier relationship with her other grownup son David (Elliott Crosset Hove) who disappears for long periods of time.     Disturbing ... Wildland Photograph: PR    At first, they are all very welcoming to poor Ida, who believes that their business is the large nightclub that Bodil appears to manage. But Bodil is the matriarch of a ruthless crime family whose main income is from acting as loan sharks. Ida quickly shows them that she too has a criminal vocation, taking like a duck to water to her new task. Jonas and David threaten debtors who are behind on their payment by picking their kids up from school and offering them a lift home – the presence of Ida in the backseat reassures these children who obediently climb into the car. There is something very disturbing about Ida’s on-screen presence and Kampp’s performance. At first, she says and does very little – clearly, the poor girl is grieving and traumatised by years of living with an addict. But then, her quiet self-possession appears to mean something else. When did she grasp the truth about her new family? When did she decide to go along with it? Or did she, in fact, decide any such thing? Is it all just post-traumatic stress disorder or Stockholm syndrome, or is manipulative crime Ida’s personal destiny? She is clearly lonely and unhappy and there are things about Ida that Bodil and the boys don’t have a clue about. But she is prepared to go the extra mile for them when things go terribly wrong. This has the makings of a big hit."
33,crime,"Sex/Crime review – lust, shock and despair in role-play thriller","Writer Alexis Gregory has described his show Sex/Crime as a “queer thriller” but it’s a tough one to classify. This is a two-hander about some exceptionally dark sexual role-playing, which finds two men breathlessly reimagining the murders committed by a gay serial killer. There’s lots of leather, drugs and violence – yet the script’s punches never quite land. The show premiered last year at Jonny Woo’s queer venue, the Glory, in east London and Woo performs alongside Gregory. Woo plays Man A; Gregory is Man B. Woo is a tax-paying, admin-abiding, suited citizen, who just happens to run sexual role-plays for a living. Gregory is his customer. He wears black gym gear and prowls about the stage with lust, verging on desperation, etched on his face: “Promise you’ll make me forget who I am.” All the ingredients are here for a powerful – and occasionally funny – piece about love, loneliness and longing. But Gregory’s writing is a bit too deliberate in places (some lines feel showy) and too abstract in others (the people never feel real). The dialogue frequently strains for effect rather than meaning (“We could be alone – together.”) Robert Chevara’s direction is over-choreographed, with every punch performed in slow motion, and bathed in red light. Every costume change is preceded by a blackout. The shocks are so signposted that, eventually, they’re neutralised. There is one seriously sexy moment with an apple but, apart from that, not enough heat in the production. Woo and Gregory are both emphatic performers but they are at their most powerful when looking out to the audience rather than at each other. Woo is also a drag queen and comic and has real presence on stage, his wry demeanour masking hidden depths. The monologues are particularly good: when Woo movingly talks about “creating new hiding places in your own shadows” he briefly touches upon the sadness this play is only just beginning to explore.  Sex/Crime is at Soho theatre, London, until 1 February. "
34,crime,"Blasphemy 'is no crime', says Macron amid French girl's anti-Islam row","Emmanuel Macron has waded into a row over a schoolgirl whose attack on Islam has divided France, insisting that blasphemy is “no crime”. The French president defended the teenager, named only as Mila, who received death threats and was forced out of her school after filming an anti-religious diatribe on social media. Macron’s intervention comes after his justice minister, Nicole Belloubet, was criticised for claiming Mila’s attack on religion was “an attack on freedom of conscience” while saying the death threats were “unacceptable”. The case has sparked a furious public debate in France, a strictly secular republic with a large Muslim population. The education authorities have since found another school for the teenager. “In this debate we have lost sight of the fact that Mila is an adolescent. We owe her protection at school, in her daily life, in her movements,” Macron said in an interview with Le Dauphiné Libéré newspaper. The president added that in finding a new school for Mila, “the state has fulfilled its responsibilities” and that children needed to be “better protected” against “new forms of hatred and harassment online that can be destructive”. “That necessity is separate from the criticism of religion. The law is clear: we have the right to blaspheme, to criticise, to caricature religions. The republican order is not a moral order … what is outlawed is to incite hatred and attack dignity,” Macron added. Mila, 16, from near Lyon, became a cause célèbre in January after she made a live broadcast on her Instagram account in which she spoke about her homosexuality. She reported that “a Muslim commentator” had responded she was a “dirty lesbian” and a “dirty whore”. She responded by posting a video diatribe against Islam. Her outburst sparked death threats and social media users posted her personal information online, including where she was attending school. The public prosecutor has opened an investigation for “death threats, threats to commit a crime and harassment” against her attackers and a separate inquiry into whether she had “provoked religious hatred”, which is punishable by the law. Abdallah Zekri, general delegate of the French Council for the Muslim Faith (CFCM), told French radio: “This girl knows exactly what she has done … they who sow, reap.” Zekri added that the teenager’s comments were not covered by freedom of expression but were insulting and provocative. Afterwards, Mohammed Moussaoui, the new head of the CFCM, said criticism of Islam had to be accepted and no remarks justified death threats. “We have to accept all the debates and refuse all violence,” Moussaoui wrote. Mila has appeared on French television to say she did not regret the video and to defend the right to blaspheme. She also apologised to those who practise their religion “in peace”. The far-right leader Marine Le Pen has defended the teenager, saying what she said “may be considered vulgar, but we cannot accept that, in 21st century France, some condemn her to death”. The case has brought echos of the Charlie Hebdo massacre in 2015, which the perpetrators claimed was in retribution for the satirical newspaper publishing cartoons several years previously of the prophet Mohammed that were considered offensive by many Muslims. In a 2007 legal case against the paper, judges declared: “In France it is possible to insult a religion, its figures and its symbols … however, insulting those who follow a religion is outlawed.” • This article was amended on 15 February 2020 to clarify that Mila reported that the threats against her came from a Muslim commentator, though this claim has not been independently verified."

It’s based on a Pulitzer-prize winning memoir from 1992; what makes this especially inviting is that Paolo Sorrentino is directing, and it will be his first film with a female lead. Dark Waters Todd Haynes’s thriller has been out for a while in the US. It comes to the UK in February, trailing acclaim for Haynes’s slight change of direction and Mark Ruffalo’s leading turn as a corporate lawyer who uncovers troubling links between unexplained deaths and the chemical company DuPont, which settled a class-action suit for $671m in 2017.

36,crime,Top 10 true crime books,"In recent years “true crime”, in the form of television documentaries and podcasts, has become very fashionable. But there has always been a small niche for true crime books, sometimes tucked – rather guiltily – below the much larger crime fiction sections in bookshops and libraries. I have about 400 such volumes – the memoirs of criminals, detectives, crime reporters and the explorations and investigations carried out by authors and academics over the last 150 or so years – many of which I have been using while working on Underworld, which is a history of the last century and a half of organised – and disorganised – crime in Britain. What is striking is how much things have changed in the last couple of decades, in that many of those involved in territorial gang warfare are now so young. Researching my book, I attended five gang murder trials at the Old Bailey and almost all of the accused and their victims were either teenagers or in their very early 20s. And at the more organised end of the underworld are now men – they are mostly men – who are almost indistinguishable from the bankers and brokers through whom they launder their loot in what is an increasingly international and tech-savvy game. Of true crime books, the most renowned of the genre are probably Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood and the late Gordon Burn’s Somebody’s Husband, Somebody’s Son, his account of the crimes of Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper. And putting everything in context is Judith Flanders’s wonderful book, The Invention of Murder, so I’ve omitted those from the list on the grounds that they need no introduction. I’ll add a plea to future true crime authors: please, no more Jack the Ripper books! 1. A Sense of Freedom by Jimmy Boyle and Redeemable by Erwin JamesI’m cheating here and naming two books because they both deal with redemption. The former is a very powerful account by the Glasgow-hardman-turned-acclaimed-artist of his time in Barlinnie prison. Erwin James, who was jailed for life for two murders in 1984, is a writer who needs no introduction to Guardian readers, who will recall the articles on prison life he wrote for the paper during his 20 years inside. When Redeemable came out, I wrote that it was “one of the most powerful and touching books on crime and punishment I have ever read … It should be on the bedside table of every Home Office minister and anyone involved in the criminal justice system.” I stick by that. 2. The Profession of Violence by John PearsonThe best book of the more than 50 volumes so far on the Kray twins. Pearson was granted remarkable access to Ronnie and Reggie at the same time as they were busy posing for David Bailey portraits. Hard to imagine that any modern-day gangsters will be quite as open with any would-be biographer.     Tricky customer … Shirley Pitts Photograph: PR    3. Gone Shopping by Lorraine GammanShirley Pitts was a shoplifter who operated in the 1950s and 60s and, when she died in 1992, was buried in a £5,000 Zandra Rhodes dress that she did not buy over the counter. Above her grave was a floral tribute in the shape of a Harrods shopping bag and the legend “Gone Shopping”, which has given the title to this perceptive and pithy book about her and the criminal background from which she came. 4. East End Underworld by Raphael SamuelPublished in 1981, this is the story of Arthur Harding, who was born in 1896 and became known as “the slipperiest character in Brick Lane”. Samuel interviewed him over a period of six years and chronicled his tales of the old East End racecourse gangs and protection rackets and Harding’s role in a bloody pub fight in 1911 that became known as “the Vendetta Affair”. 5. Good Cop, Bad War by Neil Woods, with JS RafaeliPolice memoirs – like criminal memoirs – have tended to be on the vainglorious side, with little self-reflection. This, along with Graham Satchwell’s equally frank An Inspector Recalls, is an exception. It is the inside story of an undercover drugs squad cop told in great detail and with remarkable frankness. It is also an attack on the current drugs laws, which Woods now believes mainly benefit professional criminals and cause enormous social damage: “Fighting to end the War on Drugs will do more to harm the gangsters than anything I ever accomplished as a cop.” 6. Strange Piece of Paradise by Terri JentzIn 1977, Jentz and a fellow undergraduate were cycling across the US together when they were attacked randomly at night in an Oregon campsite by a stranger with an axe. Both women survived but no one was arrested for the crime, so 15 years later Jentz went back to try and track down the man who tried to kill them. She succeeded and her work led to a change in the law in Oregon. Jentz is a friend, but I hope I would have chosen this remarkable book even if I didn’t know her.     ‘Master idiot’ … Peter Scott seen in the 2004 documentary The Heist. Photograph: Channel 4 Picture Publicity    7. Gentleman Thief by Peter ScottHe was the “king of the cat burglars” who recited from the WE Henley poem Invictus when he was arrested for his last crime, which involved the theft of a Picasso. At his funeral the gospel song Steal Away was played. This is a very candid account by the man who was described as a “master criminal” but who said that “master idiot” would have been a more accurate title. Like his contemporary, the Great Train Robber Bruce Reynolds, author of The Autobiography of a Thief, he writes with wit and self-knowledge. 8. The Lost Girl by Caroline RobertsThere were many fine books about the serial killers Fred and Rose West, including Gordon Burn’s Happy Like Murderers, Andrew O’Hagan’s The Missing, Howard Sounes’s Fred &amp; Rose and Brian Masters’s She Must Have Known. But this is a book by a victim of the Wests who lived to tell her tale. Caroline Owens, as she then was, was 16 when she was savagely attacked by the Wests but she managed to escape and would give evidence many years later in Rose’s trial, on behalf of “all those girls who didn’t make it”. Sadly, she died of cancer three years ago but her account, both of the Wests and of her depressing experiences with some sections of the press, is very poignant. 9. Murder in Notting Hill by Mark OldenThe story of the 1959 murder of Antiguan carpenter Kelso Cochrane by a white gang who stabbed him to death at a time of great racial tension in this area of west London. Told succinctly by Olden, who tracked down elderly witnesses and went through the archives on the case, this is a very timely reminder not only of a grim murder but of the ways in which investigations were carried out and reported in those days. Some of that has changed, but not all. 10. A Few Kind Words and a Loaded Gun by Noel “Razor” SmithIn this memoir, the former bank robber demystifies much of the “glamour” surrounding professional crime. He recounts one occasion when he tried to hold up a newsagent’s with a Luger pistol and was told by its Ugandan-Asian proprietor: “ Your gun is unloaded – you are minus the magazine. And you swear far too much for such a young man.” Smith bought a Mars Bar instead and told him to keep the change. • Underworld: The Definitive History of Britain’s Organised Crime by Duncan Campbell is published by Ebury Press."
37,crime,Serious crime victims wait longer for justice after court days cut,"Victims of serious crime now wait almost a year-and-a-half for the suspects to go on trial while judges sit “idle” after the government cut their sitting days – despite Guardian analysis finding almost half of all crown courtrooms in England and Wales are empty each day. Government statistics show that the average crown court case takes 525 days to go from offence to completion, up 34% from 392 days in 2010. The delay begins with the police, who have had their numbers cut by 20,600 since 2010. Ministry of Justice (MoJ) statistics show that overwhelmed forces now take an average of 331 days from the date of the offence to charge someone with a crime that will see them tried at a crown court, up from 205 days in 2010. The suspects then wait longer for their cases to be tried in court because the government has been reducing the number of sitting days for crown court judges as part of cost-cutting measures at the MoJ. Allocations fell from 97,400 in 2018-19 to 82,300 in 2019-20, according to the senior presiding judge, Lady Justice Macur. Judges are still paid the same annual salary but find themselves idle behind the scenes, unable to hear the mountain of cases piling up. The Guardian analysed the listings for all crown courts in England and Wales on one day in December and found that of the 729 available courtrooms showing on the government’s Xhibit system, which relays hearing information, 350 were not sitting. In St Albans crown court in December, one “extremely serious” historic sex case was postponed for six months because of a lack of court sitting days, leaving both the complainants and the defendant in “a dreadful state”, according to Caroline Goodwin QC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA). “They only found out on the Friday before the Monday trial that the case was not being listed,” she said in her weekly roundup. “The defendant was elderly. The list office said there would be a six-month delay before the new trial date. The local head of the Crown Prosecution Service rape and serious sexual offence unit became involved as the complainants were exceptionally distressed and unable to support such a long delay.” One crown court judge expressed frustration with the cost-cutting: “There is a simple solution. These cases need judges. This is not rocket science. There are significant numbers of fully trained, part-time criminal judges who are ready, willing and able to help out, yet they are sitting idle whilst the criminal justice system suffers delay after delay.” They added said: “The judges, the buildings, the staff are all there but there will be no solution to this problem until Government fund the system properly. Justice delayed is justice denied. ” On 16 December, 10 out of 21 courtrooms at Snaresbrook crown court in east London were not sitting; at the central criminal court, also known as the Old Bailey, 10 out of 22 were empty. Reading crown court was the only one of 84 crown courts in England and Wales to use all of its available courtrooms that day. Snaresbrook is likely to become further overwhelmed when Blackfriars crown court closes on 20 December, sold by the government for an estimated £32m. “What is Snaresbrook going to do with the 300 extra cases it receives once Blackfriars closes and its work is redirected there?” said Goodwin in her roundup. “Resident judges must dread having a hung jury. Just when can they relist those trials? From information passed to the CBA, if such a situation were to occur at Southwark, it is likely the new date for trial would be mid-2021-22. We need more sitting days.” Some cases are taking so long to reach trial that suspects on remand have to be released from jail because the custody time limit has been reached, posing a potential danger to the public. The lack of available court time can have a serious effect on vulnerable victims. In Leeds crown court at the end of October, another rape trial involving an elderly complainant with dementia collapsed after several days of problems playing video interviews in court. The jury was discharged and the first date the court could find to hear the case again was in May 2020, almost two years after the alleged rape took place. The complainant’s niece said the delay was devastating for her and the family. She said: “The stress this has placed on my aunt is catastrophic with all the emotional psyching up required each time the trial is scheduled. She is physically disabled and extremely frail. She also has dementia, which is known to be accelerated by stress and her rapid deterioration has been marked over the course of these events. Not to mention the family and everyone else involved in the case.” A spokeswoman for Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service said the technology problem at Leeds crown court was a one-off and apologised to the complainant for the distress caused. The Ministry of Justice said: “The number of outstanding cases at the crown court has decreased by almost 40% since 2014 with waiting times for these cases at their lowest ever. “We keep sitting days under constant review and allocated an extra 700 crown court sitting days for the remainder of 2019/20 in response to an increase in cases coming to court.”"
38,crime,Trump defends ‘war crime’ threat to target cultural sites in Iran,"Donald Trump has defended his threat to target Iranian cultural sites – widely seen as a war crime – if Tehran retaliates for the killing of General Qassem Suleimani. 
On bellicose form, the US president also lashed out at Iraq following its parliament’s demand for American troops to be expelled from that country, and vowed to respond with crippling sanctions. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
Trump’s comments suggest he was making no idle threat when, on Saturday night, he tweeted that the US has “targeted 52 Iranian sites ... some at a very high level &amp; important to Iran &amp; Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.” 
Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One a day later, he sought to offer a justification. “They’re allowed to kill our people,” Trump said, according to a pool report. “They’re allowed to torture and maim our people. They’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we’re not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn’t work that way.” 
 
 US/Iran potential targets 
 
Targeting cultural sites is prohibited by international conventions signed in Geneva and at the Hague. In 2017, the United Nations security council passed unanimously a resolution condemning the destruction of heritage sites. The action previewed by Trump would almost certainly involve the deaths of civilians. 
The Pentagon, however, sought to distance itself from Trump’s threats, with defense secretary Mark Esper saying on Monday that the US will “follow the laws of armed conflict”, including those that ruled out targeting cultural sites. 
Esper’s public comments reflected the private concerns of other defense and military officials, who cited legal prohibitions on attacks on civilian, cultural and religious sites, except under certain, threatening circumstances. 
Trump’s statements come after secretary of state Mike Pompeo defended the assertion that the drone strike against Suleimani in Baghdad prevented an imminent attack on US interests. “We would have been culpably negligent had we not taken this action,” he told NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday. When host Chuck Todd asked if retaliation against US citizens should now be expected, Pompeo admitted: “It may be that there’s a little noise here in the interim.” 
US-Iran tensions are escalating following last Friday’s drone strike – ordered by Trump without congressional authorisation – in Iraq that killed Suleimani, commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force.

On Monday morning in Tehran, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei presided over prayers for the slain general, and Suleimani’s daughter Zeinab told a huge crowd at his funeral ceremony that the US and its ally Israel faced a “dark day” for his death. 
“Crazy Trump, don’t think that everything is over with my father’s martyrdom,” Zeinab Suleimani said in an address broadcast on state television. “The families of US soldiers in the Middle East will spend their days waiting for death of their children.”

Before the ceremony, mourners had packed the streets around Tehran university, chanting “Death to America” and “Death to Israel”. One man held up a placard reading “hard–revenge”. 
 
  
  
   
    
    Qassem Suleimani, killed by a US drone strike in Baghdad, had become well known among Iranians and was sometimes discussed as a future president. Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;
    He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father’s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.
    Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.
    By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq’s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.
    Once described by American commander David Petraeus as ‘a truly evil figure’, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence.
    Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. “You will start the war but we will end it.”
    Michael Safi
    
   
  
  
 
The ceremony followed a turbulent weekend that saw the Iraqi parliament pass a resolution calling on the government to expel US troops, of which about 5,000 remain, most in an advisory capacity. On Sunday, Iran’s government said the country would no longer observe limitations on uranium enrichment, stockpiles of enriched uranium or nuclear research and development. The statement noted that the steps could be reversed if Washington lifted its sanctions on Tehran.

On Sunday, Human Rights Watch condemned the president’s latest threat to Iran’s culture sites: “President Trump should publicly reverse his threats against Iran’s cultural property and make clear that he will not authorise nor order war crimes,” said Andrea Prasow, its acting Washington director. “The US Defense Department should publicly reaffirm its commitment to abide by the laws of war and comply only with lawful military orders.” 
She added: “Trump’s threat to attack Iran’s cultural heritage shows his callous disregard for the global rule of law. Whether refusing to condemn the brutal murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi or pardoning convicted war criminals, Trump has shown little respect for human rights as part of US foreign policy.” 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump’s drone strike “provocative and disproportionate” and said legislation would be introduced this week to halt the president’s military actions regarding Iran unless Congress is involved. 
She told Democrats: “We are concerned that the administration took this action without the consultation of Congress and without respect for Congress’s war powers granted to it by the Constitution.” 
Trump spoke to reporters on Sunday as he flew back to Washington from another eventful holiday at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. He showed no hint of regret. Asked about vows of vengeance from Iran, the president said simply: “If it happens it happens. If they do anything, there will be major retaliation.” 
He also turned his ire on Iraq after that country’s parliament passed a resolution calling on the Iraqi government to expel US troops. “We have a very extraordinarily expensive air base that’s there,” he said. “It cost billions of dollars to build. Long before my time. We’re not leaving unless they pay us back for it. 
“If they do ask us to leave, if we don’t do it in a very friendly basis, we will charge them sanctions like they’ve never seen before ever. It’ll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame.” 
Trump’s remarks look set to trigger another political firestorm amid concerns that he has not considered the consequences of the strike against Suleimani and may even be seeking to distract from his upcoming impeachment trial. 
Brett McGurk, the former US presidential envoy to the global coalition to counter Isis, tweeted: “Trump’s comments tonight regarding Iran and Iraq are not only unacceptable, they’re unAmerican. American military forces adhere to international law. They don’t attack cultural sites. And they’re not mercenaries. Reckless and unprecedented words from a commander-in-chief.”

39,crime,The Citizen crime app hasn’t made me safer – just more scared,"On the second day of the new year, I awoke to the news that a man had been assaulted on 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue, and there had been a fist fight on the east side of Central Park. The previous day, the morning update featured an overnight fight at a Burger King in Hell’s Kitchen, possibly involving an ice pick, and an assault involving a knife 10 blocks south of my apartment. In both cases the news, which was reported to some 4,000 people in the vicinity with the Citizen app on their phones, was prefaced with demands from the app to turn on push notifications and the entreaty, “Keep your loved ones safe with urgent crime and safety alerts near them in New York.”   Related: 'We will not let up': activists protest NYPD subway crackdown    Citizen, which was launched in 2017, is a glorified police scanner that promises to help users “stay safe and informed”. It invites input from witnesses – mostly involving shaky phone footage of police milling around while a stretcher is carted by in the background – and, bafflingly, includes a comments section, in which users speculate fatuously on the crime in question and quibble over the accuracy of the map function. It is grimly fascinating, mildly addictive and, relative to its stated aims, totally without value. It is also part of what feels like the continuum of online feeds that, from Facebook down, promise to improve community while actually playing on people’s worst rubbernecking instincts to broadly divisive effect. There’s no question that Citizen can be entertaining. Who can forget the alert from several months ago informing the concerned citizenry of New York that a man with no pants on was wandering around the corner of 34th Street and Fifth Avenue? Engagement seems to be increasing. Last year, CNN reported that a car crash in Brooklyn garnered more than 130,000 views, 600 comments, and seven separate videos, while news of a recent cab on fire in Times Square was related to 31,000 people via their phones. What one is supposed to do with this information remains a mystery. There is no real public interest defense of the app, which feels like a heightened version of all other entertainment feeds designed to spike your adrenaline, make you angry or scared, or otherwise provoke useless and directionless emotion. It’s feasible that, when reports of a man throwing chairs around inside a Taco Bell in Midtown come through, you might alter your lunch plans, but the broader appeal – that this raw information culled from 911 is actionable intelligence – is nonsense. Recreationally, it feels akin to checking the sex offender register in one’s neighbourhood – which I did a few years ago and discovered, inevitably, several convicted rapists, including one living two streets away who had a history of distributing child porn. A blurry photo of the guy was attached. What, exactly, was the point, other than to give myself a horror-movie chill? A few months ago, scores of police cars converged on a street several blocks from me, and Citizen said there had been a shooting. There was no context and no further intelligence, so while the news was briefly thrilling, it did to the word “information” what has already been done to the word “engagement” – emptying it out to the extent practically of reversing its meaning. • Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist"
40,crime,Trump's threat to destroy Iranian heritage would be a war crime,"President Donald Trump’s new year message, posted on Twitter in the wake of the US killing of Qassem Suleimani, was unequivocal: “Let this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans, or American assets, we have targeted 52 Iranian sites … some at a very high level &amp; important to Iran &amp; the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.” There’s little room for doubt: the president is threatening to destroy cultural heritage, which constitutes a war crime according to several international laws that the US has both sponsored and signed. These include the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 2017 United Nations Security Council resolution 2347, which “condemns the unlawful destruction of cultural heritage, including the destruction of religious sites and artefacts, and the looting and smuggling of cultural property from archaeological sites, museums, libraries, archives, and other sites, notably by terrorist groups”. The description of Iran’s most valuable cultural sites fall under such regulations, which were first created in the aftermath of the second world war, a time in which both sides lost invaluable buildings, artworks and cultural practices, mostly due to technological advancement in the means of warfare. Fears of future wars with widespread use of aerial bombardment, even nuclear warfare, were so great that one of the nascent UN’s imperatives was to protect not only people from indiscriminate destruction, but the spaces where their livelihoods were carried out as well. This is how current shorthand terminologies such as Unesco world heritage sites were coined: not as a list of beautiful and valuable sites to be visited or seen, but as an inventory of spaces where war could under no circumstances be waged. With conflicts ongoing today that extend even longer distances between attacker and target, these legislations demand obedience by their signatories more than ever.     Islamic State destroyed the Temple of Bel in Palmyra, Syria. Photograph: Ruth MacLean for the Guardian    In the wake of the 2001 Taliban destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan and Islamic State’s 2015 laying to waste of the ancient site of Palmyra, we have become much more aware of the fragility of cultural heritage. The global outcry after the accidental fire which last summer consumed Notre Dame Cathedral was also loud: the feeling that treasures of the past are slipping away from our protection is one of the marks of contemporary culture. However, it is worth remembering that the construction of the Taliban and Isis as barbaric enemies makes it far easier for the public to denounce these events as war crimes. Iran is a widely misunderstood nation, partly because access to it has been restricted since the 1979 Iranian revolution, but mostly because cold war-era western politics coated the country with a communist veneer, shrouding it as a barbaric land, a perception which persists to this day. Its regime, non-secular and repressive, has bolstered its negative reputation recently as it has allegedly murdered more than 1,500 activists in the past three months amid an internet blackout. In this context, Iran is often viewed as a cultural void rather than the birthplace of the Persian empire and of great achievements in the arts and sciences.  Currently, 24 sites in Iran are protected by Unesco: Persepolis, one of the last massive archaeological complexes from ancient Persia, protected by Iranian institutions; the Naqsh-e Jahan Square in Isfahan with its breathtaking mosques and architecture that unifies engineering, religious symbolism and material mastery; the historic city of Yazd, the quintessential landscape from which we get all our fantastical ancient Middle Eastern references to Arabian nights.    These are some of the #IranianCulturalSites that @realDonaldTrump threatened to destroy.Persepolis. Of of the last standing massive archaeological complexes from ancient Persia. The Iranians and their cultural institutions have done a fantastic job in protecting it.1/12 pic.twitter.com/DjxH6nf3Lo&mdash; Sergio Beltrán-García (@ssbeltran) January 5, 2020    Additionally, as of August 2016, 50 more sites in Iran are on Unesco’s tentative list, awaiting ratification. As we contemplate this collection of architectural treasures, we must understand that these places do not exist apart from those who live, love, laugh and pray within and throughout them: Iranians understand their value better than anyone and have set up commendable efforts to preserve, restore and share them. We therefore cannot separate the sites’ worth from their people. Any unjustified harm that comes to Iranians, or weakens their institutions, will inevitably place these sites at risk of damage, a pattern we should have learned from Palmyra, and from Mosul after the irreparable damage to artefacts held in the museum there. Even though Unesco has set forth the foundations for the absolute protection of priceless buildings, we have yet to better understand the relationship between humans and their environment that produces culture. In light of the Trump administration quitting Unesco in 2019, the president’s threats to Iran’s cultural heritage must not be taken lightly. We should all know well what could be lost forever."
41,crime,‘It’s incredible what they see’: housing associations take on county lines crime,"Housing associations are playing a growing role in tackling county lines crimes, using their knowledge of local communities to spot early signs of abuse and exploitation. In the north west of England, the exploitation of young people by drug gangs – known as “county lines” crime – is a serious problem, not just in poorer areas but in York, Harrogate and places with good transport links. Now lawyers, housing associations and police are building networks of support to try and provide innovative solutions to the crisis. One firm of solicitors told the Guardian they are increasingly contacted by housing associations for help in responding to exploitation, in particular “cuckooing”. Cuckooing is a term for the takeover of a house owned by a vulnerable individual by drug gangs from outside the area to use as a base. Darren Burton, head of housing at Forbes Solicitors, says housing associations have unique access to vulnerable communities.   Related: 'County lines' drug gangs tracking children via social media    “Our clients provide social housing to the most vulnerable in society, making their tenants a target for criminals. There will often be dozens of people visiting the target address, causing antisocial behaviour, dealing and using drugs. “Housing associations are eyes and ears on the ground. More and more housing officers are reporting the signs of county lines and cuckooing to us. We are getting more calls than ever from housing associations asking for help with this issue.” Burton points to high-rise blocks where vulnerable people, who may have learning disabilities or mental health problems, can become isolated. “They are befriended and next thing they know the flat is taken over and someone from the gang is sleeping in the box room. A housing association can join up the dots; they have always been there on the ground.”     Cities with good transport links, such as York, have a serious and growing problem with county lines crime. Photograph: Alamy    The ultimate legal sanction to stop cuckooing in a property is a premises closure, and these are on the rise across the UK. With the National Housing Federation, Forbes is lobbying for housing providers to have more statutory powers to close properties where there is evidence they are used for exploitation. But while Burton and his colleagues do work with the police, they also try to use street-level knowledge of families to help in other ways. “For example, one property we are looking at, it’s a hive of activity and the police know about it. So that might result in a premises closure. But we always start at the point that legal action is the last resort, particularly where there is a young person or family involved. “We have a case where a young person is living with his grandfather because his parents can’t look after him due to drug problems of their own. He gets involved in postcode gangs and bringing knives and drugs into the property. His grandfather is worried but the local housing association know this family because they have been in the area a long time so are able to offer help.” The firm has joined with Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Organised Crime Unit to build a network across the region looking for solutions. In one case where a man was dealing drugs from a property, the firm worked with police and a housing association to get a partial closure, which allowed the man’s partner and children to keep using the home but barred other visitors. Detective Inspector Andy Farrell of the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Organised Crime Unit told the Guardian that these partnerships are increasingly vital in fighting child exploitation. “Across the region, areas with good transport links are vulnerable to cuckooing, like Harrogate, York and then over to the coastal areas of Scarborough, high areas of social deprivation. It’s really important now that we upskill housing associations and enhance their understanding of county lines. For example, we work with them on partial home closures so we don’t leave potential victims homeless.” He believes the deeper understanding now of how exploitation works is helping to tackle the crime in the longer term. “Now we are actually understanding that children who may have been criminalised previously are actually being exploited. Let’s look at early intervention, look at siblings of those who are being exploited and how we can divert them; we will hopefully see that impact in the future.” Peter Fahy was Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police until 2015 and is now chair of a housing association, Plus Dane Housing. He says housing associations have unusual access at a community level, in areas where cuts have removed many welfare checks.     Other issues spotted by housing officers include pop-up brothels, where criminals take over a house through short term lets or Airbnb. Photograph: Alamy    “I had always been struck as a police officer that the closest relationship was with the local housing association and their housing officers. We know that in our housing stock there are people who are incredibly vulnerable, the HAs will know who those vulnerable people are. “For example, housing associations go into every property at least once a year to do a gas safety check and it’s incredible what they see. You have repair staff seeing child protection issues, or noting when elderly people are incredibly vulnerable. It’s about helping these staff understand the signs and know what to do about it.” It is not just cuckooing and drug dealing that housing associations are seeing up close, Fahy says. “Cuckooing is extremely worrying, but beyond that are other things like pop-up brothels. This is an extremely crucial housing issue. Criminals take over a house for a brothel through short term lets or Airbnb. These are operated from properties with very exploited people. It’s extremely hard to get them to speak, they have a fear of the exploiter reaching right back into their own home country or their family.” Fahy acknowledges the problem is a huge and complex one. “Frontline staff are very fearful of the criminal groups involved. There has always been drug dealing, [but] what is different now is children are being used and exploited and the market is chaotic and crowded. “There is a very high level of drug taking in our society. If you talk to youth charities they will say there is nothing we can do – kids are offered £1,000 a day to carry drugs and it’s hard to help them once they have got involved. There is little else for them to do in their communities.”"
42,crime,Queensland religious groups fight move to make gay conversion therapy a crime,"Religious schools and organisations are fighting a move by the Queensland government to make LGBT-related conversion therapy a crime in the state. In late November, the Queensland government introduced legislation that would, among other amendments to health legislation, make the practice of conversion therapy to change or suppress a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity punishable by up to 18 months in jail. The examples provided in the legislation include aversion therapy, psychoanalysis or hypnotherapy with the aim of changing or suppressing a person’s sexuality, but it also extends to counselling and group activities.   Related: Sex is for married heterosexual couples only, says Church of England    The legislation – which followed a 2018 Human Rights Law Centre review into conversion therapy practices in Australia – has the strong support of medical bodies, such as the Australian Psychological Society, and human rights organisations, such as the Queensland Human Rights Commission. Christian organisations and schools, however, have expressed concerns that the legislation might prevent them from being able to counsel people on sexuality and gender based on their interpretation of Christianity. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon       Christian Schools Australia, along with three other Christian schools organisations that represent 80 schools in Queensland, told a parliamentary committee the legislation was “dangerously imprecise” and risks Christian schools being in line for their pastoral case programs. The associations argued “genuine” questioning of sexuality and gender identity must be allowed. “Students must be able to seek advice from school staff about their sexuality or gender identity and school staff must be able to respond to those questions,” they said. “The Queensland government must guarantee that Christian schools can continue to teach a traditional Biblical sexual ethic and a biologically and medically accurate view of sexuality.” Associated Christian Schools, which represents 38 schools in Queensland, said that the legislation as drafted could prevent religious counsellors from “communicating the institution’s religious doctrines and beliefs, whether they pertain to sexuality, gender identity or any other issue”. The association also argued that adults giving informed consent should be able to freely participate in counselling regarding their sexuality and gender. Renew Ministries, which says it is part of the ex-gay conversion therapy group Exodus, told the committee it “does not support or practice shock treatment, aversion therapy, and people who come to Renew do so voluntarily. “The inference is that Christians may in the future be dictated to as to what they may believe, say, or choose to follow,” the submission states. “This is looking to be an attack on Christians who are same-sex attracted but want to live according to their own personal definitions of their sexuality.”   Related: Vilification complaint against Israel Folau accepted by NSW anti-discrimination board    The Queensland Law Society also expressed concern over the legislation, stating there was a lack of evidence needed for the new offences, and said it could have unintended consequences. “QLS is concerned that the prospect of criminal prosecution may fetter otherwise legitimate aspects of psychological and psychiatric treatment. “Some providers may be concerned that reasonable clinical interventions might be captured within the definition of conversion therapy.” The legislation does not appear to be in conflict with the federal government’s proposed religious discrimination legislation. Attorney-general Christian Porter has said the federal legislation would not override state-based criminal law. Proposed legislation in Victoria to ban conversion therapy does not propose criminal sanctions, and the Victorian government has expressed concern that the federal legislation could override the ban. The Victorian government is preparing to release a report on consultation on the conversion therapy legislation next month."
43,crime,The best recent crime and thrillers – review roundup,"    A European prizewinner, The Godmother by Hannelore Cayre (translated by Stephanie Smee, Old Street, £8.99) is Breaking Bad meets Weeds, with a French suburban twist. Fiftysomething widowed mother of two Patience faces a precarious future thanks to a job with no pension – the French state likes to pay its court interpreters “off the books” – and a mother with dementia in an expensive care home. Years of translating police wiretaps on north African drug gangs have given her an inside track on the trade in Moroccan hashish, so, when she gets the chance to take possession of a consignment of le bon shit, she puts her fluency in Arabic to criminal use. Acerbic and witty, casting a sharp eye on both failing social systems and the fruitless “war on drugs”, Patience is one of the standout characters in this year’s crime fiction crop, and you’ll be rooting for her all the way.      Another outstanding creation is Justine Lee, narrator of The Choke by Sofie Laguna (Gallic, £8.99). It is the early 1970s in a fictional town on Australia’s Murray River, and the 10-year-old, whose mother abandoned the family years before, lives in a world of men: two older brothers; Ray, her violent criminal father, who visits periodically; and alcoholic grandfather and PTSD sufferer Pop, who attempts to provide stability. Daily life is full of threats, from innuendo to downright menace; unable to read due to undiagnosed dyslexia, Justine has nothing and no one to turn to for information or emotional support. Her brief glimpse of a less brutal life is snatched away when her only schoolfriend moves to Sydney, and there is a horrible, slow-motion-car-crash inevitability about what happens to her three years later. Raw and powerful, The Choke is not an easy read, but Justine’s resilience and strength of character make for an ending that is both redemptive and moving.      Set in a small, depressed town on the Lancashire coast, AS Hatch’s debut This Little Dark Place (Serpent’s Tail, £12.99) centres on carpenter Daniel, whose wife Victoria turns away from him after the miscarriage of a longed-for pregnancy. Increasingly isolated after his mother’s death, he starts exchanging letters with prisoner Ruby, who has been convicted of assaulting her abusive ex-partner. Soon, they begin to confide in each other, and when Victoria finally leaves and Daniel retreats to the remote cottage in the wood left to him by his mother, Ruby, now released, comes to find him ... As with all epistolary novels – Daniel is writing to someone called Lucy from an undisclosed location some years later – suspension of belief is required, and, while the recipient’s identity is not hard to guess, this elegantly creepy skin-crawler is well worth the read.      The Long Call (Macmillan, £16.99) is the first book in the Two Rivers series from the bestselling author of the Vera and Shetland series, Ann Cleeves. It is set in north Devon, where the two rivers in question are the Taw and the Torridge, and features Detective Inspector Matthew Venn. On the day of his father’s funeral, Venn, shunned by the strict evangelical community in which he grew up for renouncing his beliefs and placed even further beyond the pale by his sexual orientation, is holding his own vigil outside the crematorium when he is called to investigate a corpse discovered on a nearby beach. The only pointer to the man’s identity is an envelope that links him to the Woodyard Centre, a local daycare and drop-in space run by Venn’s husband Jonathan. The case gets even more uncomfortably close to home when Venn’s mother calls him about the disappearance of a girl who has a learning disability and also attended the centre. Fans of Jimmy Perez and Vera Stanhope need not worry: this is a traditional mystery of the best sort, with a likable protagonist and a strong female sidekick.      Antti Tuomainen, a bestseller in his native Finland, has been dubbed – with some justification – the king of Helsinki noir. His latest offering, Little Siberia (translated by David Hackston, Orenda, £8.99), starts with a famous former rally driver who has a bad habit of getting behind the wheel when drunk. He is skirting the small town of Hurmevaara at 240km/h when a meteorite crashes into his car. It’s a valuable object, and the citizens decide to keep it under guard at the local museum until it can be removed for analysis. But someone is intent on stealing it, and local pastor and military veteran Joel Huhta is determined to find out who – is it one of the custodians, the rally driver himself or Russians from across the nearby border? As if that weren’t enough, Joel has another mystery on his hands: his wife announces that she is pregnant, but wounds sustained in Afghanistan have made him infertile – a fact he hasn’t yet shared with her – so who is the father? With moral dilemmas, plenty of action, and the author’s trademark mixture of humour and melancholy, this is Tuomainen’s best yet. • Laura Wilson’s The Other Woman is published by Quercus."
44,crime,The Tories are hiding from blame for youth crime. That’s not on,"In the movie Enemy of the State, the final scene involves a mafia standoff. Accusations of disloyalty fly as weapons point everywhere. Meanwhile the real culprit hides under a table, before skipping out the back door. It reminds me of the standoff we are seeing as the police, politicians and parents all argue that schools are partly to blame for the rise in knife crime and drug dealing because of the increasing number of exclusions. The real culprit – the government, which has overseen rising crime and has the power to fix it – is being allowed to hide under the table and avoid responsibility. That’s not on.   Related: Knife crime: ‘How can I exclude a child from school if his parent gave him the weapon?’    School exclusions really are increasing. In part, this is owing to a rise in pupil numbers – and that will continue, as a demographic bubble gives us more teenagers over the next 10 years. But some of the rise appears to be because schools are more frequently saying they can no longer keep a child with behaviour problems. Plus, while the official exclusion rate hovers at about 0.1% of children, the rapid rise in home education suggests some headteachers are leaning on parents to voluntarily remove their child, to avoid an official exclusion.  Campaigners have argued that exclusions should be curbed as a way to reduce crime, and that a more nurturing approach should be adopted. Some now also say that schools should get rid of their “isolation rooms”, used to remove disruptive students from class. Teachers must have options when a 13-year-old is running around their classroom stabbing other kids in the leg with a compass, or smashing them over the head for failing to lend him a pen. Isolation rooms may be draconian for children who simply come in wearing the wrong colour socks, but they are one way to remove disruptive or violent pupils. We don’t expect doctors, nurses or train drivers to put up with abuse, why should teachers or pupils? Exclusion, too, is not problematic as long as children have a quality school to attend elsewhere. But the crux of the matter is that they often don’t. Sadly, pupil referral units are woefully variable in availability and quality, with teachers twice as likely to be temporary or unqualified compared with mainstream schools.   Related: ‘You want to shout: Stop saying that! Look at your own school funding figures!’    There is a long road from a teenager misbehaving to them being so disruptive a school can’t keep them. At one time that road involved a lot of support and intervention. Now, with services cut to the bone, it is shorter. Two-thirds of schools have cut teaching assistants to save cash. Where they are still employed, they often cover absent teachers’ classes rather than supporting vulnerable pupils. Then there are the cuts to youth support outside school. Since 2010, 600 youth clubs have closed. Councils now spend 69% less on youth services in the community. Free swimming pools? Gone. Music lessons? Gone. Opportunities for kids to get new role models and identify with a non-violent group? Oh, all gone. Meanwhile, what is our new government offering? Mostly, burble about a science revolution and the need for Big Ben to bong. A glimmer of hope emerged in the fund to provide summer holiday activities. Areas to receive these will be announced soon. Let’s see if they are a sop to constituencies with thin Conservative majorities, or a truly compelling offer.  Schools, the police and councils can’t solve a problem without resources. We can all blame each other. Or we can point at the real culprits, sitting under the table with their fingers in their ears, hoping to evade responsibility. The government must bring forward the cash to solve this problem – and do so quickly. A teenage boom is on the way."
45,crime,Should you report local drug crime – or keep schtum to protect house prices?,"Name: Melbourne. Age: First recorded in the Domesday Book, 1086. Population: Roughly 5,000. Location: About eight miles south of Derby, five miles west of East Midlands airport. Appearance: Picturesque English town with an attractive Georgian market square. Sounds nice. Indeed. It has been ranked as one of the best places to live in the UK. The quality of life in this part of south Derbyshire is, shall we say, really very high. How fortunate. I mean, incredibly high. What are you driving at? Keep it to yourself, but apparently Melbourne has a bit of a drug problem. It does? Yes, but no one talks about it. Why not? House prices. What has one got to do with the other? Everything, according to the local constabulary. “The other day we had someone call the police and say that they don’t want to call in drug incidents because they think it will make house prices drop,” Sgt Matt Ladd told a council meeting last week. Does that actually happen when you report drugs? Not according to Ladd. “That is completely unacceptable and is not true at all,” he said. “There is no basis in fact.” What kind of property prices are we talking about? The average house will set you back more than £300k. You can see why homeowners might prefer to keep quiet. Ladd disagrees. “Recording more incidents is positive,” he said. “It sends a message that we are out there and we will stop these people.” It sounds as if things are getting out of hand. Don’t worry. The police have been cracking down in recent months. So how many drug incidents were recorded in Melbourne in 2019? Nine. Sorry, did you say nine? Yes, but six of those were were recorded in December alone, after police adopted a more proactive approach. Proactive how? With regard to intelligence-gathering in cooperation with local residents. What kind of intelligence? According to the Derby Telegraph, Melbourne cemetery was highlighted as an area in which drug users were believed to gather. I could have told you that, and I’ve never been to south Derbyshire. The six incidents were largely cannabis-related. I think Melbourne may well have a drug problem – a genuine shortage. Either way, be sure to report your suspicions. Do say: “I love the period detail and the newly renovated kitchen, but I’m not sure my dealer will come all the way out here. Do you have a number for someone local?” Don’t say: “What a large and extremely private garden! How far was that airport again?”"
46,crime,"Human bone found in Primark socks not crime-related, police say","A piece of human bone found in a pair of socks bought from a branch of Primark has not been linked to a crime, police have said. The socks were bought from the Colchester store on 10 December last year and the matter was reported to police on 2 January. The bone was believed to have come from part of a finger. Essex police said they had investigated as far as was reasonably and proportionately possible. “At this time it is not linked to a criminal act,” a police spokeswoman said. “It is a possibility it was placed in the sock in its country of origin, but this cannot be confirmed. It did not appear to be a result of recent trauma and had no skin or other particles surrounding it.” The force said if any further information came to light, the case would be reviewed. At the time the bone was found, a Primark spokesman said the company took the matter very seriously. Primark said it now considered the matter closed. The company said in a statement: “It is highly probable that the object was placed in the socks by an individual for unknown reasons. Primark has been the subject of isolated incidents in the past, which have subsequently been found to have been hoaxes. Following our own and the police investigation, we consider the matter closed.”"
47,crime,"Crime, power cuts, poverty: 30 years on, the townships question Nelson Mandela’s legacy","A Friday morning in Soweto. Summer rains have washed the streets clean. The tourists cycle down Vilakazi Street, past new restaurants and street stalls selling handicrafts. In a souvenir shop window, a cleaner dusts a statue of Soweto’s most famous one-time resident: Nelson Mandela. The tourists entertain no doubts about Mandela’s grandeur and goodness, his status as fighter in the struggle against the brutal and racist apartheid regime that kept the inhabitants of Soweto and tens of millions of others in poverty and squalor, and the Nobel prize winner’s record as the first leader of a free South Africa. “Mandela has always been a hero to me, and I have tried to teach my children about him. He shows us what a single person can do to change the world,” said Marie Loyet, from Orléans, France, as she browsed T-shirts displaying some of the great man’s best-known quotes. But in his homeland, Mandela, who died in 2013, is a more controversial figure, with increasingly divergent views of both his life and his legacy reflecting deep divisions and disappointments almost exactly 30 years since the day when he walked free after 27 years in prison. This week there will be commemorative ceremonies to mark a moment that inspired jubilation in Mandela’s troubled country and a wave of hope that the dark days of the 1980s in Africa – dominated by the conflicts of the cold war – might be over.     Nelson Mandela is accompanied by his then wife Winnie, moments after his release from prison near Paarl, South Africa on 11 February, 1990. Photograph: Ulli Michel/Reuters    Cyril Ramaphosa, who was elected president in 2018, will fly to Cape Town to re-enact the moment when Mandela spoke to a huge crowd from a city hall balcony hours after his release. On that day – 11 February 1990 – Ramaphosa, who was seen as Mandela’s protege, held his speech for him. But otherwise the anniversary will pass largely unnoticed. “Efforts are being made to remind us. It doesn’t come naturally. We are moving on, perhaps too fast,” said Ralph Mathekga, an author and analyst who remembers hearing Mandela’s first speech as a free man on a radio in a small village. “I was a child but I knew something important was happening,” he said. “It was like a miracle. It touched everybody. Everyone was so happy. Now the cynicism is very high. We even want to revise history.” Soweto was once a dismal township where nearby Johannesburg’s apartheid authorities dumped non-white communities. The house on the corner of Vilakazi Street where Mandela lived for more than a decade before being sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 is a museum, an obligatory stop for both cycling tourists and school trips in what is now a bustling city with more than a million inhabitants. But many Sowetans are deeply critical of their most famous former resident. “He was a sellout,” said Senhle Nkosi, a 25-year-old graphic designer. “He just did a deal to get out of prison. He was just a front for the white people who needed peace with the black people. They had the black guy in front with the whites behind.” Brigitte Sarole, 39, disagreed. “I know him as a good guy. Without him we wouldn’t have freedom. He is a hero to me. He made a difference,” said Sarole, who is unemployed. But her friend, 31-year-old Maria Chapesele, was uncompromising. The seamstress remembered being chosen to meet Mandela when he visited Soweto when president. The admiration she felt then has turned bitter. “I was in primary [school] and we were lighting candles for him. Now I feel betrayed. So many things have gone wrong. I have three children, and I don’t want them to grow up here in South Africa,” Chapesele said.     Tourists browse the exhibits inside Mandela’s former home in Soweto, which is now a museum.  Photograph: Marco Longari/AFP via Getty Images    Former comrades from the days of the anti-apartheid struggle said Mandela had always been a more controversial figure in South Africa than overseas. Mac Maharaj, 84, was a close associate in the increasingly radical anti-apartheid struggle of the 1950s and early 1960s and joined Mandela in the armed wing of the African National Congress. Both were sent to Robben Island prison, where Maharaj secretly helped Mandela compile his bestselling autobiography. From the start, Mandela’s noble origins as the son of a chief, relative pragmatism and commitment to constitutional democracy caused friction, Maharaj said. “Mandela was saying that South Africa belongs to all, and that even in the [armed wing] we wanted to avoid bloodshed if we could. In prison, Mandela kept saying we have to put pressure on the government to talk, and people got very angry with him and accused him of selling out. They said he wasn’t a scientific socialist but a conservative aristocrat.” Anthony Butler, professor of politics at the University of Cape Town, said much of the acrimony was rooted in an ideological split within the ANC, between Mandela’s supporters and others more deeply committed to revolutionary Marxist-Leninist principles. “The conflict was very deep, very intense and had all sorts of repercussions. Mandela was not a commanding figure in prison and not prominent in the 1970s and 1980s. So when the ANC leadership-in-exile decided to make him an icon, it was far from universally popular,” he said. Criticism mounted as a negotiated peaceful transition appeared to take shape. “A lot of people in the movement saw the talks as a trap, to disarm the revolutionary movement. They accused Mandela of being a traitor. The ANC was involved in an enormous struggle itself,” said Maharaj. The euphoria of freedom in 1994, and polls that brought the ANC to power, pushed such sentiments to the margins. “Instantly, he was the saviour. He did make mistakes but he was shrewd, understood what the country needed and how to deliver it. He could bring people with him. For white South Africans there was nothing inevitable at that time about South Africa becoming a democracy,” said Judith February, a political analyst. “The myth remained alive through his presidency but after he left office [in 1999] we began to see cracks emerging.”     An owner of a convenience store, or ‘spaza shop’, picks an item for a customer as he holds a candle after a power cut in Soweto, South Africa. Photograph: Siphiwe Sibeko/Reuters    Since then, the cracks have indeed been exposed, and the ANC has struggled to match expectations. Under the nine-year rule of Jacob Zuma, who was forced to step down amid allegations of systematic corruption and incompetence in 2018, the stature of Mandela suffered further. “Zuma paid lip-service to Mandela … but we started hearing that it was allowed to question [his achievements] in a very negative way,” February said. One theme that grew in strength was that Mandela had allowed South Africa’s minority white population to keep much of the wealth and economic control accumulated over previous decades. With unemployment soaring, rising levels of violent crime, a faltering economy and deep resentment, this charge resonated – and it does so today more than ever before. On the streets of Soweto last week, anger at the ANC government was palpable. “We can’t walk our streets at night. Crime is too bad now. People are being killed,” said Chapesele. “What do the politicians do? Nothing.”    The new generation takes its disillusionment with the ANC and packages it with Mandela  Judith February     Other complaints include rolling power cuts that cripple small businesses and cause traffic chaos, an alleged influx of immigrants from other African nations, the lack of investment from overseas, and the country’s poor education system. The memory of iconic figures like Mandela suffers as a consequence. “The new generation takes its disillusionment with the ANC and packages it with Mandela … In this country we don’t do memory well. Our history isn’t well known, or well taught in our schools. Education has been the biggest single failure,” said February. In what was once rolling farmland but is now a wealthy suburb in north Johannesburg, the Liliesleaf Trust is trying to remedy this. The charitable organisation has restored the house where the ANC leaders were arrested in 1963. The raid led directly to Mandela’s imprisonment.   .   The Liliesleaf museum now houses archives and displays which attract thousands every year, including hundreds of schoolchildren, though it still struggles financially. The small room where Mandela once hid is a shrine, filled with drawings and simple expressions of appreciation and hope. “When we started the idea our aim was simply to bring Liliesleaf back to life … but it became clear we were battling something far more dangerous,” said Nic Wolpe, chief executive of the trust and the son of one of the men detained in the raid. “In South Africa we don’t treat history with the importance and reverence it deserves. We have reduced Mandela to a mythological persona, and lost sight of what he and the struggle stands for: the undying message about the goodness of humanity.”"
48,crime,Crime in Progress; A Warning; Inside Trump’s White House – review,"“Get over it”: that is how Mick Mulvaney, acting chief of staff at the White House, dismissed evidence that his boss bribed a foreign government to publicise bogus charges against his chief political rival. But it’s about as easy to get over Trump as it is to shrug off a cancer diagnosis. With Hillary Clinton archly hinting at her readiness for a rerun of the 2016 election, others are reinterpreting the past either to delegitimise Trump after the event or to prepare for his vindication at the polls next November. A weary, regretful deja vu pervades Crime in Progress, written by the researchers who brought to light the notorious dossier that traced Trump’s grubby dealings with Russian gangsters; the same document described a cabaret act supposedly staged for him by some micturating Moscow hookers, commended by Putin as “the best in the world”. Simpson and Fritsch hoped the FBI would use the information they provided to indict Trump, though its then director James Comey instead reprimanded Clinton for her insecure email server. They were disappointed a second time by the noncommittal Mueller report. This “secret history” of their persecution by angry Republicans who disputed their findings attempts to relitigate the case. Simpson and Fritsch aspire to be latter-day versions of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the reporters who exposed Nixon’s Watergate cover-up: their book opens with Fritsch sneakily foiling Bernstein’s appeal for information, and later Simpson derides Woodward for cosying up to Trump. But the new guys lack the crusading bravado of their predecessors. Their opposition to Trump starts out as a “business opportunity”, not a quest for truth or a challenge to power, and they go to work like conscientious geeks, assisted by a man they call “a human hard drive” and a woman who serves as their “in-house cyber-ninja”. The retold tale is revved up by hyperactive verbs – Simpson “cracks open” his MacBook, “pops” a beer can, and “shoots” a text message to Fritsch – and includes a strained homage to the episodes in All the President’s Men when Woodward ventures into an underground car park for creepy confabs with the CIA informant he nicknamed “Deep Throat”: summoned to testify at the US Capitol, Simpson and Fritsch are ushered into “a dimly lit chamber” in the basement where poor lighting gives their Republican inquisitor “a lizard-like appearance”, then sequestered in another office that feels “like a weird terrarium out of a sci-fi movie”. Yet there is no “cathartic finale” to match Nixon’s fall, and the ominous title of Crime in Progress deflates when the authors admit that Trump’s “conspiring with Russia may not be a crime provable in federal court”. Last year an unidentified White House official wrote an op-ed in the New York Times about the efforts of aides to frustrate the president’s most “batshit” proposals. Trump denounced the article as an act of treason, but because his only means of self-defence is name-calling, he had trouble mocking his nameless detractor. At a rally in Montana “Anonymous” got entangled with “Anomalous” on his flapping tongue and, after some slurs and gobbles that suggested dodgy dentures, the compound word expired in a sibilant whistle. In A Warning the op-ed’s covert author accuses the president of mental instability; I suppose his inarticulacy is the least of our worries. Like Simpson and Fritsch, Anonymous reels through Trump’s outrages all over again, adding a few new charges, among them a scheme to sabotage the rule of law by abolishing federal judges. Though A Warning traffics in scandal, its tone is classically lofty, with tributes to noble Romans such as Cicero and pious epigraphs from America’s founding fathers. Anonymity is presented as a selfless patriotic virtue: the writer challenges Trump on principle, not as a disgruntled individual – but now that others are openly testifying to Congress, this impersonality could just as well be deemed a form of moral cowardice. A Warning ends by saluting the passengers who stormed the cockpit of a hijacked plane on 9/11, knowing they would die but hoping to prevent the terrorists from reaching their target in Washington. Anonymous, however, is no martyr: he or she hopes to survive. How different is this duplicity from the craven writhings of Mulvaney, who once called the president he now serves “a terrible human being”? On his first day in office, after a squabble about crowd size at his inauguration, Trump demanded a phenomenological adjustment. “Truth and reality”, as Simpson and Fritsch put it, were replaced by Kellyanne Conway’s “alternative facts”, AKA falsehoods. “The Trump story,” adds Anonymous, “is briskly moving into a fictional universe.” Doug Wead’s Inside Trump’s White House goes further, advancing to enraptured fantasy. Wead, a veteran Republican toady, acclaims Trump for “the magic of thinking big”; his own padded, puffy volume is an exercise in magical thinking. Like a sun king freshly solarised on the tanning bed, Wead’s Trump radiates “beauty and intellect”. His sons are “well groomed”, his daughters “statuesque”, and his consort bends down from her spike-heeled altitude to “reach out to the suffering”. While Melania is cast as a stilettoed Madonna, Trump functions as a universal paterfamilias. “It’s a father thing,” smarms Jared Kushner to explain Kim Jong-un’s attachment to Trump: Kim’s actual begetter was a maniacal despot, so the chubby ogre has chosen a fitting surrogate. Acclaimed by Wead as the creator of his own “immortal brand”, a lucrative logo that is “etched into the marble of history”, Trump the mass-market Midas dispenses product placements at every turn. Wead, briefly alarmed, sees him press “a big, fat red button” on a table; the command produces one of the dozen Diet Cokes he swills each day, not a missile strike. Having secured the release of an American pastor imprisoned in Turkey, Trump welcomes the former hostage home by offering him a fistful of Tic Tac mints. The pastor kneels to pray and proclaims “a wonderful story of redemption”: lo and behold, the saviour who delivered him from bondage has also cured his halitosis! Wead is equally devout. He marvels at Trump’s “mystical rise to the presidency”, and cites “a privately conducted name-recognition poll” that identifies him as “the second most famous person on Earth, after Jesus”. Since Jesus is not currently on Earth, Trump probably elbows his way to first place – and if, by hook or devilish crook, he does get his venal arse re-elected, we might as well start the countdown to the second coming. • Crime in Progress by Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch is published by Allen Lane (£20).

49,crime,"Hate crime rising in 30 US cities as overall crime rates decline, report finds","A new report shows that 2018 saw a national rise in hate crimes, and that almost all extremist homicides were carried out by the far right. Hate crimes rose 9% to a decade high of 2,009 in 30 US cities surveyed for the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism (CSHE), headquartered at California State University at Santa Barbara, which published the report on Tuesday. The rise is the fifth consecutive increase and the steepest rise since 2015, and the trend has continued to rise so far in 2019, the report said. The rise happened even as overall crime rates continued to decline across those cities surveyed. The most frequently targeted groups nationally were blacks, Jews and LGBTQ people. The report shows that there was a particularly large increase in antisemitic incidents in cities like New York, and records 2018 as the “worst year ever for antisemitic killings in the United States”. The report also stated that the total number of extremist homicides decreased sharply from 36 in 2017 to 22, but that “white supremacist” homicides increased to 17, and along with two murders associated with “extreme misogyny” made up the vast majority of extremist murders. On 27 October 2018, in the lead-up to the midterm elections, Robert Bowers allegedly killed 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the worst antisemitic massacre in US history. The increase in homicides around the midterm election was in keeping with longterm trends that the report points to regarding an increase in hate crimes around major political events. The report warns that “the risk of extremist violence by (white nationalists) will likely continue into this current nascent political season”, and that they will “maintain their position at the top of the threat matrix”. Despite recent moves from Republicans to define anti-neo-Nazi groups known as “Antifa” as a terrorist organization, the report suggests that the far right has presented a much more serious threat of deadly extremist violence. The report points to “politically motivated assaults and suspected crimes–and non-violent protests” from “Antifa, anarchists, and hard left extremists”, and details 19 incidents of “Antifa harassment and violence” throughout 2018 and 2019.  CSHE director Brian Levin said in a telephone conversation that there is “a sliver of violent Antifa” but “we’re not seeing the hard left yet going in and doing mass political violence”. He said that he and CSHE colleagues are “concerned about increasing political violence”, but “we have to be very careful about who we label terrorists”. The report records that 26 transgender people were murdered in 2018. But the biggest percentage increase in reported hate crimes was against whites, from a relatively low base. Despite recent allegations of a wave of “fake hate crimes” in rightwing media, the CSHE could only find 11 false hate crime reports in 2018."
50,crime,Did Trump commit a crime? A guide to the impeachment inquiry,"The House of Representatives speaker, Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Congress, announced on 24 September an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. The proceedings have developed with a swiftness and complexity that might leave some readers feeling dazed. 
Here’s a thumbnail guide. 
What is Trump accused of? 
In a July 2019 phone call, Trump asked Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to mount an investigation of his potential rival for the White House in the 2020 election, Joe Biden, and son Hunter Biden – and also to investigate a Fox News-space conspiracy theory that Ukraine, instead of Russia, was behind foreign tampering in the 2016 election. 
Trump framed the requests as a “favor” after he reminded his counterpart that “the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine”. Overshadowing the conversation was the fact that Trump had recently suspended hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid that Congress had approved for Ukraine to defend itself against Russia . 
News of the call emerged in a Washington Post report on 18 September that an internal whistleblower complaint, filed in August, involved “communications between Trump and a foreign leader”.  
Trump’s attempted dealings in Ukraine caused a scandal in US diplomatic ranks. The Democrats have obtained text messages between top US envoys in Ukraine establishing that diplomats told Zelenskiy that a White House visit to meet Trump was dependent on him making a public statement vowing to investigate Hunter Biden’s company. “As I said on the phone, I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,” one message said. 
What’s Trump’s version of events? 
Trump does not dispute public accounts of what he said in the call, as established by the intelligence community whistleblower’s complaint, released on 26 September, and a call summary released by the White House itself the day before. 
But Trump and allies have argued that the conversation – “I’ve given you that, now I need this” – was not actually as transactional as it appears to be. That’s beside the point legally, analysts say, but you be the judge. 
Meanwhile Trump and Republicans have, without denying their conduct, sought to undermine his accusers and frame the proceedings as a partisan “witch-hunt”. 
This sounds depressingly familiar, bye 
No hard feelings, bye! But really, that appears to be part of Trump’s strategy here – to sow division and doubt to create the impression that this impeachment inquiry amounts to just one more crazy whirl around Washington’s wacky partisan merry-go-round. It’s a ride many Americans are truly sick of. 
Is this just one more whirl around Washington’s partisan merry-go-round? 
The thing is, so long as Republicans in Congress don’t contradict Trump, he has a lot of power to make it seem so. But just because Trump is out there ranting and crying BULLSHIT – just because the president is throwing a fit about the allegation that he violated his oath of office or commited a crime does not mean he did not violate his oath or commit a crime. 
Did Trump violate his oath or commit a crime? 
A lot of people – from the whistleblower, to career government officials swept up in the affair, to legal scholars, to Democrats and Republicans who have not drunk the Trump “Kool-Aid” – believe it’s plausible that the president has committed an impeachable offense. 
 
  
  
   
    
    Article 1 of the United States constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power to initiate impeachment and the Senate the sole power to try impeachments of the president. A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors"" – although the US Constitution does not specify what “high crimes and misdemeanors” are.
    The formal process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment, the equivalent of congressional charges.&nbsp;
    According to arcane&nbsp;Senate rules, after the House notifies the Senate that impeachment managers have been selected, the secretary of the Senate, Julie Adams, tells the House that the Senate is ready to receive the articles. Then impeachment managers appear before the Senate to “exhibit” the articles, and the Senate confirms it will consider the case.
    The presiding officer of the Senate notifies the supreme court chief justice,&nbsp;John Roberts, of the impending trial. Roberts arrives in the Senate to administer an oath to members.
    The presiding officer will then administer this oath to senators: “I solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of&nbsp;Donald Trump, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the constitution and laws, so help me God.”
    The Senate must vote on a resolution laying out ground rules for the trial including who the key players will be, how long they will get to present their cases and other matters.&nbsp;
    After the Senate is “organized”, the rules decree, “a writ of summons shall issue to the person impeached, reciting said articles, and notifying him to appear before the Senate upon a day and at a place to be fixed by the Senate”. A president has never appeared at his own impeachment trial. Trump will be represented by the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, and his personal lawyer Jay Sekulow, among others.
    After the oath, the trial proper will begin. Senators may not speak during the proceedings but may submit written questions. The question of witnesses and other matters would be decided on the fly by majority vote. A time limit for the proceedings will be established in the initial Senate vote.
    The senators will then deliberate on the case. In the past this has happened behind closed doors and out of public view.
    The senators vote separately on the two articles of impeachment – the first charging Trump with abuse of power, the second charging him with obstruction of Congress. A two-thirds majority of present senators – 67 ayes if everyone votes – on either article would be enough to convict Trump and remove him from office. But that would require about 20 Republicans defections and is unlikely. The more likely outcome is a Trump acquittal, at which point the process is concluded.
    Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before there was a formal vote to impeach him.

What about the other foreign countries and people involved? 
In at least five countries, Trump or Trump administration officials have been active on two fronts: urging attacks on Biden and rewriting the story of the 2016 US election. 
Trump has conscripted the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who listened in on the July Ukraine call and the attorney general, William Barr, who has met with government contacts in Italy and London and sought Australian contacts to review special counsel Robert Mueller’s Trump-Russia investigation. That investigation had prompted much impeachment talk but the Ukraine scandal quickly sparked a formal impeachment inquiry. 
Meanwhile Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has pressured Ukraine to smear Biden, and the whistleblower said White House officials had caused records of Trump’s Ukraine call to be moved into a specially restricted computer system. And the vice-president, Mike Pence, has acknowledged contacts with Ukrainian officials while claiming to have no knowledge of Trump’s Biden agenda. 
On 3 October, Trump even suggested that: “China should start an investigation into the Bidens.” That’s an abuse of power in plain sight, critics say. 
Trump, foreign election tampering – is this just a replay of Mueller? 
No. Unlike when he was a candidate, Trump’s invitations for foreign powers to attack his domestic political opponents now have all the power of the White House behind them.  
Critics say this is a plain abuse of that power and stinks of despotism.And it undermines US national security because it places Trump’s personal agenda first.  
Trump is also accused of undermining the integrity of US elections, violating the civil rights of the US citizens he is calling out for foreign attack, and violating campaign finance laws by soliciting foreign help. The Trump administration also stands accused of obstruction of Congress for resisting congressional subpoenas for documents and testimony relating to the crisis. 
What’s next? 
After a series of sensational public hearings in front of the House intelligence and judiciary committees,  the House of Representatives is set to vote on two articles of impeachment drawn up by the judiciary committee – abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. If a simple majority votes to impeach Trump he faces trial in the Republican-dominated US Senate, expected in January 2020, just as Democratic primary voting is about to get under way to pick the party’s nominee to fight Trump in the election.

51,crime,"Reform school exclusions to tackle knife crime, MPs urge","A cross-party group of MPs and peers who are investigating knife crime have urged the government to reform school exclusions, warning that being expelled can be the tipping point that leads a young person to arm themselves with a knife. They are concerned that too many pupils who are excluded from mainstream education, sometimes after minor breaches of zero-tolerance behaviour policies, end up on part-time timetables of as little as two hours a day in pupil referral units. With less time in the classroom, children are at greater risk of criminal exploitation and involvement in violence, a report by the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on knife crime has said. The report, Back to School? Breaking the Link Between School Exclusions and Knife Crime, calls on ministers to review the system so that all excluded children have access to the full-time education they are legally entitled to. It also calls for mainstream schools to be more accountable for the children they exclude. “Too many children are being socially excluded and marked as failures, with tragic consequences,” the report says. “All too often the moment of school exclusion is the tipping point that leads to young people picking up knives.” The report highlights an “alarming” rise in school exclusions. In 2017/18 there were 7,900 permanent exclusions from schools in England – a 70% increase since 2012/13. At the same time, it says there has been a “worrying” rise in youth knife crime. According to the report, more than 17,500 boys aged 14 in England and Wales carry a knife or weapon and a third of those have had weapons used against them. New Ministry of Justice figures published on Thursday show knife crime continuing to rise, with the number of first-time knife crime offenders up by 25% in the last five years. In the 12 months to the end of June, 22,306 knife or dangerous weapon offences were dealt with in England and Wales, up from 21,314 the previous year. “The number of children being excluded from school and locked out of opportunities is a travesty,” said the APPG chair and Labour MP for Croydon Central, Sarah Jones. “Often these children have literally nowhere to go. They are easy pickings for criminal gangs looking to exploit vulnerable children.” The Department for Education warned against drawing a simple causal link between exclusions and crime. “The issues surrounding knife crime and poor behaviour in schools are complicated and multi-faceted,” a government spokesman said. The APPG talked to young people about their experiences of exclusion. Some said zero-tolerance behaviour policies meant schools were increasingly dependent on using exclusions – both fixed-term and permanent – to address relatively minor misdemeanours. “I would get excluded more often and sent home more often, for unnecessary reasons, like not wearing a blazer, my socks not coming up to my knees. Just silly things like that,” said one. “It is encouraging kids to go out and do what they want because you are not giving them an education.”   Related: Knife crime is a real problem, but stop and search isn't the solution | Katrina Ffrench    Another said: “Since they kicked me out I’ve got time on my hands to do more crime, commit more crime … in Croydon with my friends who have also been kicked out who are also doing wrong things, who are also selling drugs [and] who are also carrying knives.” The report also raises concerns about recent leaked government plans suggesting an increased focus on school discipline, as revealed in the Guardian, warning: “If we see more schools adopting stricter approaches to school discipline, we are likely to see greater use of exclusions.” It calls instead for schools to be given the funding to support vulnerable children, with a focus on prevention and early intervention. It says every council should appoint a leader responsible for children excluded from school and school rankings, and results should take account of all pupils, including those they exclude. A government spokesman said: “The government has been clear that it will always back teachers and headteachers in delivering discipline in the classroom. We are clear that permanent exclusion should only be used as a last resort and exclusion from school must not mean exclusion from education.” Julie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “The causes of knife crime are complex, and we need to be careful not to make school exclusions the scapegoat for this issue. However, it is certainly the case that we need to do better for vulnerable young people.”"
52,crime,The best recent crime and thrillers – review roundup,"    BBC news journalist George Alagiah worked extensively in South Africa, and he has put his knowledge to good use in his debut novel. The Burning Land (Canongate, £14.99) is a political thriller that contrasts the perception of a post-apartheid “rainbow nation” of equal opportunities with the corrupt and often violent reality, in which the gap between rich and poor grows wider by the day. Shady deals by people at the top are resulting in large tracts of the country being sold to foreign investors, leaving those who farmed it without jobs or homes. Activist Lesedi Motlantshe, son of a prominent anti-apartheid campaigner who is now busy lining his pockets, is murdered. Childhood friends Lindi Seaton, the well-intentioned daughter of white liberals who works in conflict resolution, and Kagiso Rapabane, the activist son of the Seatons’ former housekeeper, form an awkward alliance in order to discover the truth. Although Alagiah makes fairly heavy weather of the necessary scene-setting and exposition, it’s worth hanging in there, as the plot shifts up a gear and becomes a gripping tale of events spinning out of control in a country struggling to redefine itself.      Things get pretty heated in Manhattan in Linwood Barclay’s latest novel Elevator Pitch (HQ, £20): someone is tampering with the lifts, causing people to plummet to their deaths, and leading, in a city full of skyscrapers, to widespread panic. It could be the work of the Flyovers, an “alt-right” group with grievances against liberal elites, or it could be someone with an altogether more personal agenda … While NYPD detective Jerry Bourque investigates the murder of an elevator technician, mayor Richard Headley agonises over what to do, and his number one critic, journalist Barbara Matheson, tries to uncover the truth. The plot, which also involves Headley’s son and Matheson’s daughter, is somewhat contrived, but Barclay does a good job of keeping all the characters in play in a proficient thriller that presses all the right buttons.      There’s more high-rise hell in Through the Wall (Avon, £7.99), a first novel from the journalist Caroline Corcoran. Lexie and Harriet are neighbours in a smart but poorly soundproofed London block. Lexie has gone freelance and is having carefully timed sex with partner Tom in an attempt to get pregnant. Increasingly isolated, she spends a lot of the day in pyjamas, listening out for Harriet, her glamorous, party-giving neighbour, and envying her. Meanwhile, Harriet, a blackout drinker with no real friends, obsesses over Lexie, whose life she believes to be perfect, thanks to Lexie’s carefully curated online persona. The pair pass the narrative baton between them for a largely successful foray into Girl on the Train territory, replete with jealousy, stalking, gaslighting and control-freakery, although habitual readers of psychological thrillers may find the reveal, when it comes, to be something of a let-down.      The destructive outsider in American author Joshilyn Jackson’s Never Have I Ever (Raven, £12.99) is Roux, newcomer to a suburban community in Pensacola, Florida. When she hijacks a mothers’ book club by initiating a wine-fuelled game of confession (“What’s the worst thing you ever did?”), diving instructor Amy senses trouble. Not only does her best friend’s husband’s affair come to light, but it’s clear that Roux knows Amy’s own secret, a crime committed as a teenager that has haunted her ever since, and intends to blackmail her. Determined to protect herself and her family, Amy retaliates by digging into her tormentor’s past to uncover her secrets. Jackson raises the stakes again and again in this skilfully plotted novel.      In July it was the 50th anniversary of the murders of Sharon Tate and her friends by the followers of Charles Manson and cult lit seems to be having a moment. In The Family by Louise Jensen (HQ, £7.99), widow Laura is left emotionally and financially bereft after the sudden death of husband Gavan, and when the members of an organic food cooperative who live nearby offer her and her 17-year-old daughter Tilly a home, she accepts gratefully. It soon becomes clear that their new “family” isn’t what it seems – clues include the white clothing, charismatic leader and emphasis on security. Although the cult itself is not entirely convincing, the novel is a very good study of vulnerability, and how our best intentions can often lead us astray.      A Shadow on the Lens (Orion, £14.99) by Sam Hurcom employs the folk-horror staple of the rational outsider who arrives in a superstitious backwater to solve a mystery. It’s 1904, and Thomas Bexley, an early forensic photographer, travels to a remote village in Wales to investigate the gruesome murder of a young girl. The place is grim, the inhabitants sullen, the authorities keen to blame a party of Travellers, and the frustrated Bexley soon falls into a fever, suffering appalling hallucinations. Uneven and marred by anachronisms, this is nevertheless a promising debut – gothic, claustrophobic and wonderfully dark. • Laura Wilson’s latest novel is The Other Woman (Quercus)."
53,crime,The Confession Killer could well be Netflix's smartest crime saga yet,"Back when true crime documentaries existed on the margins of culture, tucked away on late night TV, the genre was pretty easy to ignore. But now that we’re swamped with endless films and podcasts and series about people who kill people, or people who got away with killing people, or people who were convicted of killing people they didn’t actually kill, it’s hard not to feel a little queasy. These are horrible, terrible acts of violence, and they’re also the source of a seemingly neverending stream of mass entertainment. The newest, thoroughly grisly addition to the fold is The Confession Killer. A five-part documentary that recounts the story of Henry Lee Lucas, it is currently among Netflix’s top 10 most-watched shows in the UK. This won’t count as a spoiler if you haven’t seen it – after all, it’s called The Confession Killer – but Lucas is famous for being the man who claimed responsibility for hundreds of murders. In 1983 and 1984, Lucas’s apparently unstoppable urge for killing helped a taskforce of Texas rangers clear 213 unsolved cases from its books. It didn’t matter that the victims, methods and weapons appeared to be chosen at random, nor that actual tangible evidence was scarce. Lucas had confessed, and that was enough. As such, The Confession Killer is less of a whodunnit and more of a ‘hedunnit?!’ It is, in every way, a classic Netflix true crime documentary. Structurally, it could have been created by an algorithm. The visuals are all grainy archive footage mixed with new interviews. There are clips of sensationalist old documentaries about Lucas that drip with cartoon blood. The theme tune is a wobbly video nasty number. It’s much longer than it needs to be, with three episodes of good material padded out to five. If you saw Making a Murderer, or The Confession Tapes, or The Keepers, you could quite easily sleepwalk through all the major beats of this.     ‘Terrible acts of violence, treated as mass entertainment’ ... Joyce Lemons, mother of alleged Lucas victim Debbie Sue Willamson. Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix    Crucially, it also offers up no new information. That’s because Lucas isn’t some obscure little serial killer – he’s one of the most infamous criminals in US history, whose death sentence was pardoned by George W Bush. Several films have been made about his life. One of them – Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer – is so notorious that it took 17 years to be released uncut in the UK. The Confession Killer is in many ways the ultimate boilerplate true crime documentary, dredging up a case that’s already been dredged up countless times. However, there is a different way to read it, and it makes the whole thing more palatable. Perhaps – just perhaps – it’s a comment on us, and our unquenchable thirst for murder. Looking back, it’s clear that Lucas was more than just a potential killer – he was fascinated by death, and had a willingness to be whatever people wanted him to be. To the police, he was a bucket in which to throw all their unsolved crimes, with Lucas often appearing to cold-read investigators like a seaside clairvoyant until he’d gained enough details of each murder to suitably pass himself off as the killer. He became a media sensation thanks to his happiness to fit into the profile of a serial killer. The term was still new and sexy in the early 80s, and the public was desperate to cram anyone they could into a mould they were yet to fully understand.And now he’s back again, right as the true crime documentary epidemic is at its peak. We’ve become a planet of armchair investigators, doling out sentences left and right between mouthfuls of crisps, based on nothing but what the television tells us about a case. We cannot get enough of murder shows. We want more of them, all the time, no matter what. Like the police who took Lucas’ word that he had killed 600 people, we’ll lap anything up. If The Confession Killer was simply intended to be a series about Lucas – a man who has already had more screentime than many other serial killers put together – it’s a mediocre one at best. But if it’s actually a sly jab at us and our obsession with reheating gruesome deaths, then perhaps it’s Netflix’s smartest true crime saga of them all.  The Confession Killer is available on Netflix now "
54,crime,Knife crime hits record high in England and Wales,"Knife crime in England and Wales reached an unprecedented high in the year to June, increasing by 7% on the previous 12 months, according to figures. Police-recorded offences involving a knife or sharp instrument rose to 44,076, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, the highest figure recorded since 2010-11 when comparable data began. Almost half the offences were stabbings, 43% were robberies and the figures also included rape and sexual assault. In the 12 months to June there were 235 knife murders and 412 attempted murders, while the total number of homicides recorded by the police fell by 5%, from 719 to 681 offences. There was also a 14% fall in homicides where a knife or sharp instrument was involved, to 248 offences, mainly because of a decrease in London.   Related: How London's Camden Lock became a flashpoint for knife gang killings    The data did not include Greater Manchester police (GMP) because of a “technical issue that resulted in previous undercounting of crimes involving a knife or sharp instrument”, the ONS said. GMP have subsequently changed their methodology and data from December 2017 onwards.   Graph   Joe Traynor, from the ONS centre for crime and justice, said: “While overall levels of violence have remained steady, the number of offences involving a knife has continued to increase across England and Wales. “However, the number of homicides where a knife or sharp instrument was involved decreased, driven by falls in London. “There is a mixed picture in the total number of knife crime offences across police forces with the Metropolitan police recording little change in the last year.” Javed Khan, the CEO of the Barnardo’s charity, said in response to the ONS figures: “Knife crime is a symptom of a much wider, complex problem. Too many young people are suffering a ‘poverty of hope’, facing a future with no qualifications, no job prospects, and no role models.”"
55,crime,The Gloaming review – shades of Twin Peaks in fog-swamped crime drama,"Every once in a while a film or television series comes around with an aesthetic so eye-watering it makes plaudits such as “evocative” or “painterly” seem manifestly inadequate. Occasionally – as is the case with Stan’s eight-part mystery-drama The Gloaming, from creator and writer Vicki Madden – the visual oomph of the production seems to manifest as a kind of viscous residue, sticking to your psyche the way a sweat patch clings to your armpit. Take a bow, Marden Dean: the show’s gimlet-eyed cinematographer, who also shot Breath, Boys in the Trees and The Infinite Man. The Gloaming is the latest in an emerging trend of Tasmania-based productions that view the island state as a place of terrible beauty, located somewhere south of the mainland and west of hell – following on from Jennifer Kent’s period piece The Nightingale, Foxtel’s gothic drama Lambs of God, and another series helmed by Madden: the terrific, darkly ravishing 2016 disappearance thriller The Kettering Incident.   Related: The Commons review – eerily plausible and uncomfortably timely climate crisis drama    Like Kettering, The Gloaming is bathed in frosty moonlight and ensconced in fog and haze. It has a Scandi-noirish atmosphere and a plotline drawn from a more defined genre playbook: the police procedural thriller. A twisty narrative involving deaths and disappearances is led – as is customary – by a pair of good-looking detectives who discover the case they are working on Is Personal and may connect to a crime committed many years ago.     A commanding presence: Emma Booth as Molly in The Gloaming. Photograph: Bradley Patrick/Stan    We see vision of events related to that crime in a surreal introductory sequence depicting young teenagers Jenny McGinty (Milly Alcock) and Alex O’Connell (Finn Ireland) venturing towards a big old creepy house, past a forest of tall, bony trees and a collection of grimy tombstones. The property’s occupant is less than thrilled to see them and fires a shotgun at Jenny at point-blank range. This moment is depicted in a way that obscures the face of the attacker and the impact of the bullet. Alex grows up to be a police detective played by Ewan Leslie – delivering another highly effective, twitch-inducing performance following recent appearances in The Cry and Safe Harbour. Alex is directed to partner up with Molly, who is played by Emma Booth: a very commanding presence, here and in the icky 2017 horror-thriller Hounds of Love. The pair haven’t seen each other in a couple of decades and share some kind of a past – although, three episodes in (the first three eps form the extent of this review) it’s not clearly exactly what. Molly is called in to inspect a corpse at a crime scene early in the first episode, in a creepy and surreal moment, like a David Lynch production, and, like Twin Peaks, involving a body found near water – in this instance, a very cinematic-looking waterfall in the background. This body has not been wrapped in plastic but wrapped in rather gnarlier barbed wire.     Ewen Leslie delivers another highly effective, twitch-inducing performance as Alex in The Gloaming. Photograph: Bradley Patrick/Stan    The significance of the barbed wire is one of several points of discussion. Many things are unclear, though it’s obvious that – if you’ll pardon the Ghostbustery parlance – there’s something strange in the neighbourhood, with potential links to occult practices. Grace Cochran (Rena Owen), leader of the local church community, looks more than a little suspect. And the mentally unhinged young man Freddie (Matt Testro) is a dark horse: forever one step away, it seems, from taking the story to very twisted places. The “this time it’s personal” connections that make the case of heightened interest to Molly and Alex, as well as some stilted dialogue, occasionally give The Gloaming a whiff of all-too-familiar dramatic contrivance, antithetical to its otherwise thrilling air of surprise and intrigue. Given the show’s genre framework, you wouldn’t call it strikingly original, but it sure is striking: particularly as a work of atmospheria.   Related: Upright review – Tim Minchin's road-trip series is clever, scenic and addictively good    Does Madden write the appearance of mist into her scripts? Did she breathe down the necks of Dean and the directors (Michael Rymer, Greg McLean and Sian Davies), reminding them to fog up the lens? Legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa extensively used wind machines, intensifying the environment and infusing his films with symbolic visuals: the winds of change, the winds of good and bad fortune, the winds signifying chaos and tumult. Madden is doing something similar with mist, here as in The Kettering Incident. Its menacing and mysterious qualities thicken up the frame, covering it with a kind of enigmatic, semi-translucent vapour.  In A Tale of Two Cities, Charles Dickens described a “steaming mist in all the hollows” as a force that “roamed in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding none.” He called it a “clammy and intensely cold mist” that “made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do.” Roaming forlornness, an evil spirit, an unwholesome sea: these feel like apt words to describe the brilliant brume of The Gloaming. Certainly better than “evocative” or “painterly”. • All episodes of The Gloaming are available to screen on Stan on New Year’s Day"
56,crime,The Irishman review – Scorsese’s sweeping tale of crime and politics,"It’s been almost a quarter of a century since Martin Scorsese teamed up with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci for his epic mob drama Casino. Now, thanks in part to the miracle of digital de-ageing technology, the septuagenarian trio have reunited for another sweeping tale of crime and politics, spanning six decades as it blends the episodic, adrenaline rush of GoodFellas with a rather more contemplative melancholia. Adapted by Gangs of New York co-writer Steven Zaillian from Charles Brandt’s book I Heard You Paint Houses, The Irishman chronicles the life and times of Frank Sheeran, a second world war veteran turned hitman whose story intertwines with that of notorious Teamsters head Jimmy Hoffa. Backed by Netflix, and clocking in at an expansive three-and-a-half hours, this may seem tailor-made for television audiences. Yet the energy with which Scorsese conducts this labyrinthine elegy ensures that it has enough cinematic oomph to propel it through a brief theatrical window before finding its natural home on the small screen on 27 November. We first meet Frank in his 80s, decrepit and ruminative, his confessional inner monologue turning to outer narration as he looks back on his life with a mixture of pride and regret. With mouth turned down, chin pushed up and blue eyes staring straight ahead, De Niro leads us through Frank’s wild years – from the traumatic events of the war (after which “whatever happens, happens”) to a chance meeting with Pesci’s crime boss Russell Bufalino (described by Frank as “the rest of my life”) and an introduction to Hoffa (Al Pacino, in boisterously shouty form). “In the 50s, he was as big as Elvis; in the 60s, he was the Beatles,” says Frank of Hoffa, whom he also compares to General Patton. All this is framed within a “peace mission” – a 1975 road trip from Pennsylvania to Michigan, with cigarette breaks and rear-view mirror flashbacks to a past in which blood is photogenically splashed upon walls and faces. While Frank plays his cards close to his chest, he’s surrounded by a rogues’ gallery of volatile characters, from Pacino’s charismatic superstar union leader, who comes on like a not-so-distant relative of Tony Montana (fuelled by unstoppable self-belief), to Stephen Graham’s “Tony Pro”, referred to dismissively as “the little guy”, but in whose company I felt genuinely unsafe (think GoodFellas’ Tommy DeVito without the jokes). As for Pesci, he adopts effective understatement throughout, cruising in sotto voce mode through the fog of contested events, his eyes often hidden behind dark glasses that make him resemble a more dangerous version of Karl Lagerfeld. Several characters are introduced with breathless on-screen headlines, detailing their names and the hour of their deaths – some natural, many more violent. Yet while Zaillian’s frequently funny dialogue is full of “take the cannoli”-style bon mots (“You charge a gun; with a knife, you run”), it’s notable that Anna Paquin packs a largely non-verbal punch as Frank’s increasingly disillusioned daughter, Peggy, whose silence cuts her father to the core.           Watch the trailer here    As the story shuffles the decades like a pack of cards (plaudits to ace editor Thelma Schoonmaker for making the transitions seem entirely organic), production designer Bob Shaw and costume designers Sandy Powell and Christopher Peterson ensure that each vignette has a clear sense of time and place. For all its flash-back/flash-forward tricksiness, The Irishman rarely seems disjointed or thematically fractured. It conjures a kaleidoscopic illusion of depth that only starts to shatter as the pace flags in the final act. As for the much-debated regenerative facial effects, they are for the most part impressively unobtrusive. It says much that I found De Niro’s eerily blue eyes more distracting than any of the VFX work on his face, and was only really aware of the technological trickery in scenes where body movements seemed notably out of synch with a character’s years (a middle-aged Frank gingerly kicking a grocery-store owner is a case in point). An eclectic soundtrack opens and closes with the dreamy doo-wop strains of the Five Satins’ hit In the Still of the Night, mixes in the timely sounds of Jackie Gleason and Jerry Vale, and cheekily plants the theme to Jacques Becker’s French-Italian crime drama Touchez pas au grisbi in one incidental scene. Meanwhile, Robbie Robertson conjures a theme tune featuring spaghetti harmonica, slow-bowed bass strings and lolloping drums that sounds like it escaped from The Pink Room of David Lynch’s Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, perfectly capturing the heady cocktail of sadness, threat and tarnished glamour that runs through the movie. The Irishman is on Netflix from 27 November and also on theatrical release"
57,crime,Two Syrian defectors to go on trial in Germany for war crimes,"Anwar Raslan and Eyad al-Gharib thought they had escaped Syria’s civil war when they fled to Germany and applied for political asylum. But unlike most of those seeking refuge, they had once been part of the state’s machinery of oppression. When the conflict began, both men were members of the notoriously vicious intelligence service, which arrested, tortured and killed protesters and opposition figures. But both defected from the regime, and they seemed to have thought that would protect them from their past.  On Thursday Raslan and Gharib will appear at a regional court in the south-western German town of Koblenz, the first trial for war crimes relating to state torture in Syria since the start of the conflict nine years ago. Raslan, 57, is charged with crimes against humanity, rape, aggravated sexual assault and 58 murders at Branch 251, an intelligence unit with its own prison in Damascus, where he allegedly oversaw the torture of at least 4,000 people as a commanding officer between 29 April 2011 and 7 September 2012. The indictment lists prisoners being hung from their wrists, electrocuted, beaten until unconscious and subjected to a method called dulab, or wheel, where victims were forced into a vehicle tyre and then hoisted up and beaten. Eyad al-Gharib, 42, a more lowly official allegedly tasked with rounding up protesters, is accused of assistance to torture and murder in 30 counts. Six Syrians who were tortured at Branch 251 have been given the right to appear at the court as co-plaintiffs, though travel restrictions introduced since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in Europe mean only three are expected to be present when the trial begins. The Koblenz trial taking place because in 2002 Germany enacted the legal principle of universal jurisdiction for crimes against humanity, allowing the prosecution of serious crimes in its courts even if they happened elsewhere. A special war crimes unit at Germany’s federal criminal police was set up in 2003, initially investigating suspected genocides in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Yugoslav wars. As thousands of Syrian refugees applied for asylum in Germany between 2015 and 2017, the unit received more than 2,800 tipoffs about crimes allegedly committed under the regime of Bashar al-Assad. In the case of Raslan and Gharib, the initial tipoffs came at least partially from the men themselves. It appears that, when interviewed by German officials, they made little attempt to hide their part in the violent suppression of political dissent.  Raslan is understood to have deserted from the regime in 2012, after forces loyal to Assad carried out a massacre in his home town. He sought asylum in Germany in 2014. Living at a refugee shelter in Marienfelde, Berlin, Raslan did not change his name, and he was eventually recognised by other Syrians, including opposition supporters and a prominent human rights lawyer. Raslan appeared to have no fear of German authorities. According to reports in German newspapers, independently confirmed by the Guardian, Raslan entered a Berlin police station in February 2015 to request protection from Syrian and Russian intelligence operatives he believed had followed him to a recent doctor’s appointment. “He appeared to think there was nothing to it,” Christian Ritscher, an investigator for the German public prosecutor general in Karlsruhe, told the Süddeutsche Zeitung. Raslan, who was probably already on the radar of the German war crimes investigators when he sought official protection, was arrested in February 2019. Gharib too gave German investigators more information than they had expected. When interviewed for his asylum application in Germany in the summer of 2018, he freely said that in Damascus he had helped round up protesters and people taking pictures of the protests on their phones, who were transported to Branch 251. He claimed to have deserted in January 2012 because he had been asked to kill civilians, and because three of his colleagues had died in skirmishes near Damascus. His knowledge of the secret police’s procedures led to him being taken in for further questioning, initially as a witness. But he was reclassified as a suspect after revealing extremely detailed knowledge of torture methods, including the use of kettles to burn victim’s backs and the breaking of detainees’ legs with iron bars to stop them taking part in future demonstrations. A legal complaint about the interview procedure led to Gharib briefly being released, but this was rejected by the federal high court last June. The fact he did not try to flee from German authorities in the meantime is likely to count in his favour at trial. Whether Raslan and Gharib will plead guilty or not guilty is unclear. The pair are being represented by separate defence lawyers, who have both declined to comment on their strategy.  In the courtroom, the two Syrians’ role in the regime’s torture apparatus will be weighed against their decisions to defect. If it comes to sentencing, “the court will also have to take into account what these men did after taking part in human rights abuses”, said Patrick Kroker, a Berlin-based criminal lawyer working with some of the co-plaintiffs in the case. The hope among the Syrian diaspora is that the trial, which could last two to three years, will not just test the guilt of two individuals but also lay bare the workings of a violent system that suppressed and murdered thousands of civilians. "
58,crime,'Crimes not reported' as public lose confidence in police,"The police watchdog has warned that public confidence is being damaged with officers “rumbled” for struggling to investigate crimes – such as burglary – and by stop and search, which is 10 times more likely to target black people than white. Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS) said the public is increasingly not bothering to report certain crime types, generally less serious offences such as car crime. Matt Parr, HM Inspector of Constabulary, warned victims faced varying chances of their reported crimes being investigated, depending on where they lived. The low level but more frequently occurring offences are known as “volume crimes”. While policing generally is in good shape, the inspectorate said, forces face pressures from a decline in resources coupled with rising demands. The inspectorate is criticised by many in policing for being slow to speak out about government cuts. Parr said public faith in policing was in jeopardy: “I think these levels of volume crime resolution are corrosive for the long-term relationship between the public and police. “There are some worrying trends – victims of domestic abuse, sexual assault, where victims are no longer supporting the prosecution – is a more complex and worrying issue. “But I think particularly in the volume crime area the public has rumbled that the police capacity to deal with this is extremely limited. There are some strikingly low figures about car crime resolution meaning most of the public simply give up reporting it because the chances of anything positive happening are so slim.” Parr said questions needed to be asked:“whether we, as a society, are prepared to tolerate a situation where so much volume crime isn’t properly investigated”. Following an inspection of all 43 forces in England and Wales, a HMICFRS report, Divergence Under Pressure, noted the decline in the number of crimes reported which led to a criminal charge: “The likelihood of the police bringing someone to justice following a criminal investigation is decreasing. In England and Wales, a suspect was charged in 7.8% of recorded crimes last year, down from 9.1% the year before.” The police inspectorate also warned that stop and search could damage the already low confidence black Britons have in policing. Stop and search is rising as a response to concerns about violent crime. Police believe it is essential but the vast majority of stops do not lead to an offence being detected and the inspectorate warned of massive disproportionality for black people: “The negative effect of poor police and community relations should not be underestimated.” The inspectorate found that the worst forces for investigating crimes were Cleveland, Northamptonshire, Warwickshire and West Mercia."
59,crime,'Crime against humanity': UN expert calls on Australia to stop selling weapons to war-torn Mali,"The independent United Nations human rights expert in Mali has called on Australia to cease selling arms to the war-torn country and urged the international community to do more to stop nations “actively producing and selling weapons” in conflict zones. The Guardian revealed on Wednesday that the Australian government had issued 16 permits to arms manufacturers to export weapons or military technology to Mali in 2019. Mali has been in near-perpetual conflict for eight years. Last year, while Australia was approving the weapons sales, the UN warned that internal conflict was causing an “unprecedented humanitarian crisis” in Mali, displacing hundreds of thousands of people and putting millions of civilians at risk.   Related: Australia sold weapons to Mali as UN warned violence creating 'humanitarian disaster'    Alioune Tine is currently monitoring the deteriorating human rights situation in Mali as the UN’s independent expert. Just last month, Tine warned the multiple failures of the state – in administration, justice and security – were facilitating “mass violence with impunity” in central Mali. He told the Guardian that Australia should stop exporting arms to Mali. Tine said the diffusion of arms in the region should be considered a crime against humanity, and urged the international community, including the UN security council and African Union, to do more to pressure those nations exporting arms to conflict zones. “What solutions exist to stop the spread of weapons, end violence and its tragic consequences in the Sahel, which actively poses a threat to the existence of states, results in millions of deaths and precipitates humanitarian catastrophes?” Tine said. “The international community, notably the security council of the United Nations and the African Union, must hold countries which are actively producing and selling weapons accountable, and pressure them to cease these practices in all conflict zones, including the Sahel.” “The democratisation and the diffusion of weapons must be considered to be a crime against humanity.” The Australian government says its export licences are only issued after thorough assessments on whether arms will be used to breach human rights or any of Australia’s international obligations. If there is an overriding risk that the weapons could be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of humanitarian law, defence says it will not issue an export permit. The department has, however, refused to say what it is exporting, to whom, and for what purpose. Requests under freedom of information law for such details have been refused. Human Rights Watch, Oxfam and Save the Children have all called for greater transparency on Australia’s arms sales.    This is why we need more transparency from the Australian government around arms sales.  https://t.co/vFJA9ivvd1&mdash; Elaine Pearson (@PearsonElaine) March 11, 2020    Tine said the African Union’s Agenda 2063 seeks to put an end to the use of weapons, as well as controlling the quantity of weapons circulating in the Sahel, a massive stretch of Africa that incorporates central Mali. “In the Sahel, the intent behind the possession of weapons and the practice of violence has never been democratic in nature,” he said. “Today, no less than 20 million weapons circulate in the Sahel (including kalashnikovs, heavy machine guns, rocket propelled grenades, and surface to air missiles).” “In Libya, between 800,000 and 1 million weapons are estimated to be in circulation.” Nikita White, from Amnesty International, said the organisation had repeatedly called on the Australian government to publicly report the details of its international arms transfers. “As we approach the fifth anniversary of the conflict in Yemen it would behove our government to remember that Australia is obliged under the Arms Trade Treaty not to authorise weapons transfers to countries where there is an overriding risk these weapons could be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international human rights or humanitarian law.” White said Australians had a right to know whether weapons from Australia were being sent to countries where they risked being used to commit war crimes. “All parties to the conflict in Yemen, including the coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have committed serious violations of international humanitarian law. The coalition has carried out indiscriminate attacks, killing and injuring civilians and the conflict has displaced millions and put up to half of Yemen’s population at risk of starvation.”"
60,crime,Australia's rural drug use tops city consumption: crime commission analysis,"Drug use in regional Australia is outpacing consumption in capital cities, according to new data. Figures released by the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission on Monday show that while Sydney is still the capital for cocaine, and heroin is most frequently found in Melbourne, it is in regional Australia where drug use is most pronounced. The data – which analyses wastewater from sites across Australia – reveals that in regional Australia the average use of methamphetamine, oxycodone, fentanyl, MDMA, cannabis, alcohol and nicotine outstripped capital city consumption. Now in its third year, the commission’s wastewater analysis shows how much of each drug is being consumed around the country, underlining the size of the market. Perhaps most concerning for law enforcement, some drugs have been intercepted at a greater rate than others. While almost twice as much MDMA was seized as was used, heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine seizures remained at half or less-than half of consumption.   Related: Humiliating and potentially unlawful: punitive police tactics cast shadow over music festivals    The commission’s chief executive, Michael Phelan, said the latest figures showed demand for drugs “has not gotten any better”. “Australians have an insatiable demand for all sorts of narcotics and synthetic drugs,” Phelan told reporters in Brisbane. The figures show that population-weighted average consumption of methamphetamine, cocaine, MDMA and heroin in capital city and regional areas all increased in the period measured. Besides heroin use in regional areas, all of those drugs saw the highest consumption levels since measurement began. The data did, however, show an overall drop in the use of prescription opioids such as oxycodone and fentanyl, though in some areas, including Tasmania, the use of the former increased. Sewage analysis cannot differentiate between neighbourhoods or suburbs, and the waste being sampled is a mix of that flowing from prisons, hospitals, offices, homes, hotels and shopping centres. It also cannot distinguish between prescribed or illicit opioid use, or whether nicotine intake is from tobacco, e-cigarettes, patches or gum. The commission aims to establish baseline data of substance use across Australia, claiming the latest data collection represents 55% of Australia’s population, or 12.9 million people. Its results are used to inform government policy and decision making, as well as law enforcement activities."
61,crime,"UK’s organised crime threat at record level, warns National Crime Agency","Britain risks losing the fight against organised crime unless police receive significant new resources to tackle the “chronic and corrosive” threat from such groups, the head of the National Crime Agency has warned. In a chilling assessment, the NCA’s director general, Lynne Owens, said the threat from organised crime groups was at unprecedented levels. “It is chronic and corrosive. The message needs to be heard by everyone.” She added: “People should understand that serious and organised crime kills more of our citizens every year than terrorism, war and natural disasters combined.” In a rare political intervention, the head of an agency often described as Britain’s equivalent to the FBI reopened the debate on police funding, arguing that without significant investment the UK’s forces would fall further behind the criminals exploiting encrypted communications technology and dark web anonymity. “Against a backdrop of globalisation, extremism and technological advances, serious and organised crime is changing fast, and law enforcement needs significant new investment to help combat it,” said Owens, ahead of this week’s launch of the NCA’s annual strategic assessment into the impact of organised crime. Last year Whitehall’s spending watchdog revealed the jobs of 44,000 police officers and staff had been lost since 2010, when the coalition government came to power, and that the Home Office had failed to even forecast the possible impact. The writer Misha Glenny, who will chair a panel of senior officers at the NCA’s report launch in London on Tuesday, said the austerity drive had allowed powerful crime syndicates to flourish in the UK.   Related: Review: McMafia by Misha Glenny    Glenny, whose book McMafia documented the globalisation of crime after the break-up of the Soviet bloc, said that when it was published in 2008 organised crime was viewed as a global concern and its impact on most British citizens was minimal. “In the past 10 years what is really striking is how this industry has grown inside the UK. Austerity has been absolutely critical in this, partly because of the reduction in police capacity but also because of the continuing increase in inequality. A lot of victims of organised crime tend to be people on the margins who don’t have a voice. When you get an impoverishment of the population, which is what we have had over the last 10 years, you get an increase in desperation, and that opens up opportunities,” added Glenny. Transnational criminal networks, the exploitation of technological improvements and “old-style violence” is allowing serious crime gangs to “dominate communities”, the NCA assessment will say this week. “It will reveal the changing nature of organised crime and its wholesale undermining of the UK’s economy, integrity, infrastructure and institutions,” said the NCA in a statement. The assessment, described as the most comprehensive yet by the NCA, will also chart the rise of poly-criminality where organised groups operate in several illegal trades such as drugs, firearms and human trafficking. Last year the agency mapped 4,629 OCGs (organised crime groups) inside the UK with tens of thousands of members and says the threat has since continued to grow. One area of enduring concern remains the use of encrypted and anonymisation technology, the latter primarily on the dark web, that have eroded the ability of investigators to detect offenders.    One area of enduring concern remains the use of encrypted and anonymisation technology, the latter primarily on the dark web    On Saturday, the NCA celebrated the conclusion of an eight-year investigation by seizing £6m worth of assets, including an award-winning luxury hotel and a £100,000 Bentley, from alleged members of an international money-laundering group. The assessment is also expected to warn that advances in technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the introduction of 5G, will present further potential opportunities for criminals. Uncertainty surrounding Brexit will also be identified by the agency as an area for criminal exploitation. Last year the NCA raised concerns that crime groups would exploit “the design and implementation of a new UK customs system, or increased challenges for EU and UK law enforcement in locating and extraditing international fugitives, if the UK were to lose enforcement or intelligence-sharing tools”. The report will also document the latest developments on modern slavery and human trafficking, organised immigration crime, cyber-crime, money-laundering, drugs and guns. So-called “county lines” drug supply networks are still expected to affect all 43 police forces in England and Wales."
62,crime,The Lib Dems have the most radical approach to crime and justice,"From the off, the Conservative party hardline approach on crime and justice under Johnson’s premiership became clear: 20,000 new police officers on the streets was one of his first pledges, followed by increased use of stop and search, prison expansion, more Tasers, and longer jail sentences – all of which have ended up in the manifesto. So, clearly, tough on crime. But what about the causes of crime? Very little on offer. The manifesto briefly mentions a prison education service focused on work and a new approach to drug addiction treatment to reduce drug deaths.  But this is important. This is despite the government’s own serious violent crime strategy acknowledging that like other types of crime and antisocial behaviour, violent crime has a clear link to “poor life outcomes”. Low educational attainment, poor health including mental health, unemployment, socio-economic factors, weak ties to family and exclusion rates all have links to crime. Furthermore, the evidence shows that at least with regards to non-sexual and non-violent crimes, a more rehabilitative, community approach is more effective. Labour promises to set new standards for community sentences and introduce a presumption against prison sentences of six months or less for non-violent and non-sexual offences. It will rebuild youth services and invest in a youth justice system in which schools, local authorities, health authorities and youth services divert young people away from the pathways towards crime. And it will tackle the disproportionate levels of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) children in custody. But there are other areas where the party looks to strengthen the security framework. It also pledges to create “modern” prisons, hire 2,000 more prison officers than the Tories and overhaul use of stop-and-search but doesn’t specifically promise to reduce its application. The Liberal Democrats have one of the most radical offers. The manifesto talks about adopting a public health approach to violent crime, a line the previous home secretary, Sajid Javid, appeared to be warming to before Johnson took power, transforming prisons into “places of rehabilitation and recovery” and makes a specific pledge to cut the number of people in prison by introducing a presumption against short prison sentences and ending sentences for the possession of drugs for personal use – a first step to decriminalisation. Most radically, it wants to legalise cannabis in the UK by introducing a legal, regulated market for the drug. The party would introduce limits on the potency levels and permit cannabis to be sold through licensed outlets to adults over the age of 18. This would be following the steps of other countries such as Canada, and some US states. Labour offers a Royal Commission, which drug reform experts have warned would take years and could deliver nothing but the status quo."
63,crime,NSW police commissioner 'misleading' for linking strip-searches to knife crime,"The New South Wales police commissioner, Mick Fuller, has been accused of being “shrill and misleading” after he claimed reducing strip-searches could lead to an increase in knife crime despite less than 1% of all searches in the state being conducted for that reason. Following a NSW coroner’s recommendation that police limit the use of strip-search powers at music festivals to cases of suspected drug supply, Fuller claimed in an interview with the Sydney tabloid newspaper the Daily Telegraph on Monday that a reduction in the use of the controversial power could lead to increased knife crime. Comparing NSW to London, where the use of stop and search powers and knife crime is a major law and order issue, Fuller told the Telegraph young people should have “a little bit of fear” of police and said questioning “the legitimacy of policing” had “a negative impact on public safety”.   Related: NSW Labor calls for review of strip-search laws, asking 'where's the justification?'    Fuller claimed knife crime in the UK had gone “through the roof” after police scaled back the use of stop and search powers in 2014 – a broader power not necessarily the same as a strip-search – and “isn’t taking over Sydney” because of the use of strip-searches. But data shows NSW police rarely search people they suspect of being in possession of a knife or weapon. Of the more than 20,000 searches conducted by police in the period between 2015-16 and 2018-19, less than 1% were done on the basis of a suspicion the person was in possession of a knife or other weapon. Instead, the vast majority were based on the suspicion the person was in possession of illegal drugs. In the 2018-19 financial year, 91% of strip searches were conducted for that reason. The data was first published in a report commissioned by the Redfern Legal Centre and conducted by University of New South Wales law academics Michael Grewcock and Vicki Sentas.  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning        Using NSW police data, the report also found that knife offences accounted for less than 1.5 % of charges resulting from strip-searches in the period between 2016 and 2019. Grewcock told Guardian Australia advocates for reform of strip-search powers had never called for police not to be able to search people suspected of carrying weapons. “The point is that this is not an argument about strip-searching for weapons. When police are strip-searching 16-year-old girls at Splendour in the Grass in ways that are plainly quite abusive this has nothing to do with weapons,” he said. “Police aren’t looking for knives when they’re strip-searching people at music festivals. “This is the concern raised by us, the Redfern Legal Centre, people like [Greens MP] David Shoebridge and others: that, particularly with the use of drug dogs, strip-searches are being used to police small quantities of drugs and we’re saying that should stop. “I think it’s quite a shrill and misleading response from the police commissioner.”   Related: ‘Devastating’: the drug inquest findings that condemn ‘wholesale’ strip searches    Samantha Lee, the Redfern Legal Centre’s police powers solicitor, agreed, saying advocates wanted police to target things like weapon possession. “This is precisely what RLC is calling for, that strip-searches be limited to serious offences such as weapon offences and drug supply,” she said. Last week the NSW deputy coroner, Harriet Grahame, released findings of an inquest into six deaths at music festivals in NSW. Besides recommending a pill-testing trial and the scrapping of drug dogs at festivals, Grahame also said strip-searches should be dramatically curtailed to only being used in cases of suspected supply. The “wholesale practice of strip-searching young people” was of “grave concern”, Grahame said. The NSW police have reacted strongly to the report. In her findings, Grahame revealed the commissioner had attempted to stop her considering strip-searches as part of the inquest, and following its release Fuller personally said he opposed pill testing."
64,crime,Crime in Progress review – the secret history of the Trump-Russia investigation,"In January 2017 a meeting took place in a deserted building in Foggy Bottom. It was conspiratorial. The office in downtown Washington belonged to David Kramer, long time aide to the Republican senator John McCain. His furtive guest was Ken Bensinger, a reporter for BuzzFeed. Kramer had brought with him a series of confidential memos. They concerned Donald Trump, the man who was about to be sworn in as US president, and his murky ties with Russia. Kramer laid them out on the table. In delicate fashion, he then excused himself and said he had to make a phone call and pay a visit to the bathroom. Bensinger whipped out his iPhone. He photographed the papers, one by one. Kramer came back half an hour later. Kramer had served as a US assistant secretary of state under George W Bush and was deeply appalled at the prospect of a Trump presidency. For good measure, he shared the memos with other news organisations and Obama officials. Kramer’s thinly deniable leak ignited a scandal that would consume Washington life for three long years. The memos didn’t quite ease Trump from power. But they did shed light on one of the biggest and longest-running mysteries in 21st-century politics: why is Trump so fulsome and such a suck up when it comes to Vladimir Putin, a KGB guy not over-blessed with charm? The author of the Foggy Bottom dossier was Christopher Steele, a former MI6 officer who spent a career digging up Russia’s dark secrets. His memos alleged that the Kremlin had been sup-porting and cultivating Trump for at least five years. And that in best KGB tradition it had acquired a sizeable amount of Trump kompromat, which could be deployed for blackmail purposes.     The lobby of the Ritz Carlton hotel in Moscow. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images    Steele knew Russia well. He served at the British embassy as the USSR fell apart, and swapped government spying in 2009 for private business intelligence. In spring 2016 a Washington-based research firm, Fusion GPS, got in touch. Might Steele use his network of sources to investigate Trump? Specifically, what Trump had got up to over the years in Moscow? Crime in Progress is billed as the secret history of the Trump-Russia investigation. It is more or less that: an entertaining and readable account of the dossier’s origins, and of the cosmic fall-out once Buzzfeed put it online, to Fusion’s fury. Trump, of course, denies wrongdoing and says he’s the victim of a witch-hunt. He has called Steele a “failed spy” and Marxist plotter. The book’s authors Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch co-founded Fusion a decade ago. As Wall Street Journal alumni they know how to tell a story. Crime in Progress doesn’t radically alter our understanding of the collusion saga, but there are plenty of colourful details and anecdotes. Once Trump shuffles off stage – in 2020 or later – a movie version seems highly likely. Fusion began its own research into Trump in August 2015, at the behest of a Republican client. It found damning open-source evidence: court documents, corporate bankruptcies and ties to organised crime. It turned to Steele to get intelligence from inside Russia. Many strands pointed there. What Steele might find was uncertain. “We threw a line in the water and Moby-Dick came back,” Simpson writes dryly. According to Crime in Progress, Steele’s first Fusion memo sketched out the Putin-Trump relationship. It included an eye-popping claim that the FSB spy agency – once directed by Putin himself – had videoed the future president in a compromising situation. In 2013 Trump had allegedly cavorted with prostitutes at the Ritz-Carlton hotel. The future president had watched a “golden showers” show, it said. That the FSB bugged hotel rooms in Moscow was an open secret, known to western diplomats and spies. Still, Simpson and Fritsch were stunned. After reading the report, Fritsch exclaimed: “What the fuck?” Simpson said: “I know.” Steele assured them the memo was credible. It drew on seven sources, including a Moscow foreign ministry official, a former Russian intelligence operative, and two witnesses from inside the Ritz. Crime in Progress doesn’t tell us who the sources are, alas. There are a few tantalising clues: a single accomplished “collector” gathered much of the intelligence, we learn. Steele calls him – or her – a “remarkable person with a remarkable story who deserves a medal for services to the west”. Great care was taken to keep identities secret. The fate of Sergei Skripal – poisoned in Salisbury by a visiting Moscow death squad – was all too possible.     Christopher Steele, the former MI6 agent who compiled a dossier on Donald Trump. Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA    Once it became clear that Trump was in bed with Russians, Steele alerted the FBI and Downing Street. The book claims he had a memorable encounter with Sir Richard Dearlove, former head of MI6, in the Garrick Club. Dearlove intimated that the Theresa May government in which Boris Johnson served as foreign secretary was suspicious of Trump’s Moscow ties. It had made a political decision not to “push the matter further”, Dearlove told Steele. (Dearlove, contacted by the Guardian, has rubbished the book’s account of this meeting) Simpson and Fritsch made their own ultimately doomed attempts to cry fire over Trump and Moscow. They sought out Dean Baquet and David Remnick, editors of the New York Times and New Yorker respectively, the Washington Post’s national security team and other senior US journalists, Crime in Progress alleges. All were interested in the dossier’s explosive content. But publishing it was another matter. The book’s blunt conclusion: the media failed. There was wall to wall coverage of Hillary Clinton’s underwhelming emails, hacked by Russia’s GRU spy agency and given to WikiLeaks. But the more important story – that Moscow had potentially compromised a White House candidate – went unwritten. Simpson and Fritsch are scathing about the FBI. On the election’s eve it told the New York Times there was “no clear Trump link to Russia” – a misleading statement, even in an age of lies. After the dossier leaked, livid Republicans went on the counter-attack. Trump’s allies in Congress denounced Fusion and tried to subpoena its bank records. There were lawsuits from Russian oligarchs, hit-pieces from rightwing US media, cyber-raids. These were bruising times. Simpson acknowledges his firm was in a “shitload of trouble”. With an almost $2m (£1.5m) legal bill it very nearly went under. And what of Robert Mueller? The special counsel’s investigation into collusion was sincere but flawed, the book says. Mueller confirmed Steele’s reporting: that the Russians sweepingly and systematically interfered in the 2016 vote. But Mueller, Simpson and Fritsch argue, didn’t follow the money and was overcautious. In the end he failed to find sufficient evidence to prove a criminal conspiracy, in part because of obstruction by the president and his allies. Three years on, the authors believe the dossier was mostly right. Many of Steele’s allegations have been borne out or have proved “remarkably prescient”, they argue. Others remain “stubbornly unconfirmed”. A handful – including a claim that Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen met with Russians in Prague – “appear to be doubtful though not yet disproven”. Cohen and other Trump friends are in jail. In July Mueller gave evidence to Congress. A day later Trump picked up the phone and rang Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The riveting impeachment hearings on Capitol Hill suggest the Ukraine drama is season two to the original Russia boxset: with Trump again soliciting favours from a foreign power in order to smear a political opponent. Another day at the Oval Office, another alleged crime.

66,crime,The best recent crime and thrillers – review roundup,"    The Girl Who Lived Twice (MacLehose, £20, translated from Swedish by George Goulding) is the third instalment in David Lagercrantz’s continuation of Stieg Larsson’s Millennium series featuring ferocious uber-hacker Lisbeth Salander and crusading investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist. While Lagercrantz’s prose is more serviceable than the peculiarly clodhopping original writing, by this point the main characters have, sadly, become subject to the law of diminishing returns – in particular Salander, who is now just another all-purpose kick-ass heroine; despite the all-guns-blazing ending, there’s a half-heartedness to the story of her continued battle with twin sister Camilla. Far more intriguing, despite its unlikely beginnings, is the investigation into an ill-fated Everest expedition, although the necessity of shoehorning the narrative into the Millennium framework distances the action, thereby lessening its dramatic impact.      At the start of Lisa Jewell’s latest psychological thriller, The Family Upstairs (Century, £12.99), Libby, who has just turned 25, inherits a house in Chelsea. Adopted, she has little knowledge of her origins, but now she learns that the property belonged to her family and that she was found there as a baby, alone but for the corpses of her birth parents and an unknown man. Her two siblings, then teenagers, had disappeared, and haven’t been heard of since. The narrative baton passes between Libby, who is trying to discover more about the past; mother-of-two Lucy, virtually destitute on the Côte d’Azur; and Henry, who tells the story of how his parents became victims of charismatic David Thomsen, who moved into their home and made himself theleader of a micro-cult, stripping them of all their possessions. The connections between the three, and the true extent of the devastation, gradually become clear. Creepy, intricate and utterly immersive: an excellent holiday read.      Take It Back by Kia Abdullah (HQ, £12.99) explores uncomfortable issues around class, gender, religion and prejudice. When Jodie, a 16-year-old white girl with facial deformities, accuses four Muslim teenagers of raping her, who is telling the truth? The boys, who corroborate each other’s stories, come from hardworking immigrant families and have a lot more going for them than pitiful Jodie, who lives on a squalid estate with her neglectful alcoholic mother and is routinely bullied at school. One of the few people who believes her is her lawyer, Zara Kaleel, who has defied her family in throwing over both her marriage and her membership of a prestigious chambers, and now works with victims of sexual assault. The trial becomes a flashpoint and, as battle lines are drawn, Kaleel is branded a traitor to the Muslim community and the truth begins to look ever more complicated. This is a superb legal thriller that fairly crackles with tension.      The second outing for Martyn Waites’s Tom Killgannon, The Sinner (Zaffre, £18.99), takes place after the courtroom action is over. The former undercover cop, now leading a quiet life in Cornwall under witness protection, is tasked with posing as a prisoner in order to discover where serial child killer Noel Cunningham has buried his two final victims. Once in jail, Tom is in the process of befriending his repulsive cellmate when gangster-turned-prison-kingpin Dean Foley, behind bars as the result of Tom’s efforts, recognises him. Not only is Foley out for revenge, but Tom’s handlers on the outside have stopped taking his calls … Pacey but atmospheric, with a palpable sense of claustrophobia and menace.      Former foreign correspondent Tim MacGabhann’s debut novel, Call Him Mine (W&amp;N, £16.99), paints a picture of Mexico that would not find favour with the tourist board: pollution, drug cartels, lawlessness, missing people and a mountain of dirty money. Journalist Andrew and his photographer lover Carlos are working on a piece about the country’s former oil capital, Poza Rica, when they come across the mutilated body of a student activist. Carlos’s desire to investigate further gets him tortured and killed. Andrew, grieving and jittery on a diet of coffee and LSD, sets off on a quest for answers that leads him into a web of corruption stretching all the way to the boardrooms of America. Strong stuff, but MacGabhann’s blend of violent action and vivid, even lyrical description is laced with dark humour and is very readable.      Those who prefer something gentler should pick up The Case of the Wandering Scholar (Bloomsbury, £14.99). The second book in Kate Saunders’s Victorian series featuring archdeacon’s-widow-turned-sleuth Laetitia Rodd begins with a missing person. It’s 1851 and Jacob Welland’s dying wish is to be reunited with the brother he hasn’t seen for 15 years, but eccentric Joshua, who left Oxford University to live the life of a rural tramp, is proving hard to find. Laetitia heads out to the countryside in search of him, but all is not well between Rachel and Arthur Somers, the old acquaintances with whom she is staying, and she soon finds herself with more than one mystery to solve. With a well-crafted plot, an engaging protagonist, and astute nods to the literature and theological squabbles of the period, this is a perfect novel for a summer afternoon. • Laura Wilson’s The Other Woman is published by Quercus."
67,crime,We victims of hate crime can use anger as a force for good,"It was a surreal, nearly out-of-body experience to sit frozen in panic on the tube, as I realised the people around me reading tabloids and scrolling through newsfeeds were looking at a photo of Melania Geymonat and me. The previous week, I went about my normal life, albeit with a headache and a bruised face, in the city that afforded me anonymity. But the sensationalised coverage of the “London bus attack” warped last summer into a dystopian, invasive episode.   Related: Do these homophobic attacks mean we’ll again have to hide our same-sex relationships? | Amelia Abraham    It is hard to convey the loss of autonomy and agency from being the unwilling subject of a photo that goes viral. Never having sought publicity, I was suddenly everywhere, reduced to a “lesbian on the bus” (the media continues to misidentify me as such; I’m bisexual) after Melania and I were photographed as the victims of a homophobic attack. Following the trajectory of viral stories, the headlines disappeared abruptly, but we were pursued for months by politicians, reporters, celebrities, and businesses who thought we could benefit their brands and bottom lines. Then the wait began for the trial of our attackers to drag the episode back into the headlines, but by November, I was ready, and stronger.     ‘The CCTV footage shows the aggressive targeting of people for their identity.’ Images show the attack on Melania Geymonat and Christine Hannigan on a London bus on 30 May. Photograph: Metropolitan Police/PA    The media distorted and exploited our story rather than focusing on marginalised hate crime victims who suffer far more than broken noses. There were bright spots, though, borne of Melania’s sharing and openness. Friends and strangers told us that previously intolerant relatives’ hearts had softened as a result of our story, and that the incident forced them to confront their own traumas. We connected with important organisations: Citizens UK is lobbying the Law Commission to classify ​misogyny​ as a hate crime and to make ​hate crime reporting​ intersectional. ​#WeAreTheBlackCap​ is a grassroots campaign that’s been workingfor nearly five years to reopen the historic gay bar and LGBTQ+ performance venue, The Black Cap, in Camden, rather than see it converted into more unaffordable luxury flats plaguing London. The Anne Frank Trust equips young people with the knowledge, skill and confidence to challenge prejudice and discrimination. I might have found myself propelled on to a platform I neither wanted nor felt qualified to stand on, but I have accepted that the attack conferred some responsibility on me. In the autumn, I read Audre Lorde’s 1981essay The Uses of Anger: Responding to Racism, which insists anger must be mobilised into a collective labour of love to fight systematic and interconnected injustice and oppression. You cannot be outraged by homophobia but indifferent to racism; supportive of disabled rights but not those of migrants; feminist but transphobic. Speaking of potential collaboration between black and white women to fight racism, Lorde writes “we have been raised to view any difference other than sex as a reason for destruction ... to face each other’s angers without denial or immobility or silence or guilt is in itself a heretical and generative idea. It implies peers meeting upon a common basis to examine difference, and to alter those distortions which history has created around our difference. For it is those distortions which separate us. And we must ask ourselves: Who profits from all this?” In court, I saw the CCTV footage for the first time of the encounter on the bus. The boys corner us, looming and jeering, while Melania tries to deflect, as we often do in those scary situations. After a few minutes, I walk directly back to the boy throwing coins and a brawl erupts. The footage shows the aggressive targeting of people for their identity, and what it looks like when you’ve had enough of it. Squaring up to five teenage males was obviously not the most judicious recourse, but I will not back down from the simple sentiment: stand up for each other, and fight back. Lorde’s words now motivate me in the face of that incident in the summer – and the recent election result. The UK reinstated a party that exploits differences in service of enriching themselves, destroying the planet, and keeping their foot on the necks of anyone who is not a rich, white, able-bodied straight man. “Anger expressed and translated into action in the service of our vision and our future is a liberating and strengthening act of clarification, for it is in the painful process of this translation that we identify who are our allies with whom we have grave differences, and who are our genuine enemies.” • Christine Hannigan is from the US and based in London, where she researches the privatisation of urban infrastructure and spaces"
68,crime,Call for universities to stop keeping students and parents in dark on crime stats,"When Nigel Herring received a call at 3.30am from his daughter Lydia, a student at Salford University, he knew something was wrong. She had returned home from a night out with her housemates to find they had been burgled: one bedroom had been ransacked and all their laptops were gone. “Hearing her panicking and crying and knowing we were two hours’ drive away made us feel so helpless,” says Herring, a bus driver and part-time firefighter, who lives near Whitby, North Yorkshire. When Lydia started as a fresher a year ago, Herring says he felt able to relax because she needed to use a key card everywhere on campus, and security guards were very visible. Her second year was different: “When we visited the house to help her move, I did think there were a lot of trees and shrubs round it. But you’ve got to let them make their own decisions,” he says. Now the Complete University Guide, an independent guide to UK universities, is urging the Office for Students (OfS) to consider compelling universities to collect and publish statistics on crimes, including burglary, assault and bike theft, so students and parents can make more informed choices. Salford University is unusual in the sector because it already publishes monthly data on its crime rates – which it says are much lower than most of its competitors. Salford’s chief security officer, Trevor Jones, himself the father of a first-year student, says security doesn’t stop at the campus gate. Students can use the emergency messaging app Callmy if they are scared anywhere in the city, which connects instantly to Jones’s control room. If they are being followed, they can shelter in a number of shops, cafes or pubs under a safe-haven scheme. Jones runs regular sessions teaching students to be streetwise and protect their homes.   Related: #MeToo on campus: UK universities investigate sexual assaults themselves    “When students come back after the holidays we’ll be sending out reminders saying if you’ve got new phones or laptops for Christmas, look after them. We advise students how to look after belongings and to watch out for phone snatchers,” he says. Privately, urban universities say any league table of crime on campus would be unfairly skewed against them. And campus-based universities argue their students are more likely to report crimes to the university in the first place, because they are aware of the security team. The Complete University Guide sent freedom of information (FOI) requests to 143 universities asking about crime rates on campus, and how they monitor them. They found 31 universities did not collect central information about crime on campus, while 77 did – but only four said they made this information public. Dr Bernard Kingston, chair of the CUG guide, who wants to see the OfS intervene, says: “In our discussions with universities there has been a clear view that crime data would not be actively published for fear of reputational damage. However, the same argument could be made for many other types of information about universities.” Dr Dominique Thompson, author of a new parenting guide, How to Grow a Grown Up, and a university GP for nearly 20 years, says students need to learn quickly when they get to university – but not all do.  She points out, for example, that several student burglaries often happen in the same street in one night. “The police say this is because burglars will sit outside watching while everyone is getting ready for a night out, and then go in when they’ve seen all the houses emptying. Obviously, coming home to a door that’s been kicked in can be pretty traumatic, and students then worry the burglars will return.” Thompson denies universities are hotbeds of crime, but says: “Students may not want to talk about security as it’s a bit frightening, but it is a conversation parents need to have.” Although universities compile their crime data in different ways, the new FOI responses suggest real variation in crime levels across the sector. Levels of violence recorded at some universities were higher than elsewhere. For instance, the University of Essex recorded 54 acts of violence in the two years from 2016 to 2018, and both Kingston University and the University of Surrey recorded 43 acts of violence. By contrast, Bournemouth University recorded no acts of violence over those two years; Huddersfield University recorded fewer than five, and Salford recorded four incidents which it categorised as “assaults”. However, what is included may vary, with some universities including threatening behaviour or verbal assault under the category of violence.   Related: University Guide 2020: university profiles from A to Z    A spokesperson for Essex says the university is open about student safety and provides support to students as well as working closely with police across its three campuses. But, she says: “We are concerned that any comparison between universities would be misleading. Comparing campus universities, often spanning hundreds of acres with large numbers of residential students, with a city-centre university, is almost meaningless.” Kingston University says the latest police data show Kingston is one of the safest boroughs in London. “The university takes the personal safety of its students and staff very seriously.” This includes police attending the freshers’ fair to advise on safety, a 24-hour security service, and CCTV across all sites. The University of Surrey says the safety of students and staff “is a top priority for us” and crimes are treated “extremely seriously”. “Our highly visible and approachable security team operates 24 hours a day all year, actively encourages reporting of crimes and contributes to us being recognised by students as one of the safest places to study in the UK.” Bike theft is a big issue at many universities, reflecting a wider national problem. According to their FOI responses, Leeds University recorded 257 bike thefts between 2016 and 2018; Nottingham University recorded 242; and the University of Manchester 238. A spokesperson for Nottingham, which publishes all its crime statistics in an annual security report, says: “We meet regularly with the local beat sergeant to discuss how we can assist in the arrest of prolific known offenders, and support the police at a time when it is facing increased pressure on resources.” The university’s security team compiles evidence, including CCTV footage, which has contributed to 36 offenders being dealt with in the courts in the past year. But, they say, the penalties for bike theft are not a sufficient deterrent. Manchester’s spokesperson says: “The university provides a diverse range of crime reduction services, especially in relation to cycle theft. These include a subsidised cycle lock scheme and free bike registration.” Until now the CUG guide and others have used postcode-based police data to form a picture of how safe universities are, but critics say this pulls in unrelated crimes from the local area that have nothing to do with students and staff. Andrew Wootton, director of ProtectEd, which accredits university security and safety services, wants universities to collect statistics on student crime victims so they can understand what is happening. But he feels pressuring them to publish is unnecessary. “The bigger issue is how universities prevent these problems. More than two-thirds of students are under 24, so that means huge numbers of young people away from home for the first time. Universities need to make sure they are giving them the best advice and support.”"
69,crime,Senior officer suggests austerity fuelled surge in violent crime,"Funding cuts to police and public services that previously helped stop people, especially the young, from offending has helped fuel the surge in violent crime, a police chief has said. Supt Darius Hemmatpour of Scotland Yard’s violent crime task force, said stabbings and other life-threatening attacks in London spiked after 2017, and suggested that austerity was a factor. Speaking at the Police Superintendents’ Association annual conference he said: “Austerity has obviously impacted on individual families and households. “Public sector services were cut. There comes a point that services previously available were no longer there. “People on the edge of criminality may have previously had an intervention that may have diverted them away, but with the loss of those services, that intervention was not there.”   Related: Knife crime is linked to Tory austerity, Sadiq Khan to say    He added: “If you take 20,000 police officers off the streets of England and Wales, because of austerity, that creates a void.” Hemmatpour’s comments echo statements from others in policing, linking violent crime to the effects of austerity. He said a massive focus and deployment of resources was now slowly reversing the trend for those aged under 25.   Boris Johnson has pledged to recruit 20,000 police officers over the next three years, the exact amount lost after funding cuts by previous Conservative governments since 2010. Senior ministers claimed at the time that crime would not rise, but the most serious offences did. Hemmatpour said changes in drugs markets were also a factor, with phenomenon’s such as county lines leading to violence between competing drugs gangs. He said knife victims were suffering more ferocious injuries, with surgeons reporting up to eight woulds inflicted in an attack: “Five years ago you would see two to three knife wounds, now there are seven to eight.” He added that disputes were becoming more intense, fuelled by social media: “Before there might be a punch. What social media has done is antagonise people, you can really rile people. “I’m not sure killing someone is in the thought process, to say: ‘That was my endgame’. I just think it is done with such hatred and venom, the reality and the severity of those stab wounds lend themself to homicide.” Weapons being used now include “Rambo-style knives”, tornado and zombie knives, Hemmatpour said. Met chiefs have said they wanted to cut the level of stabbings, especially those suffered by those under 25 years of age. Hemmatpour said there were now 370 fewer victims under 25 because of a phalanx of measures but the level was still too high. Stop and search was a vital tactic, he added, with the Met having increased its use to 25,000 a month as well as expanding the use of section 60 powers which allow stops without reasonable suspicion.   Related: Knife crime is a real problem, but stop and search isn't the solution | Katrina Ffrench    In one day, Sunday, police started investigations into three deaths in London following a drive-by shooting in north-west London, the fatal stabbing of a mother also in north-west London, and the death of a man in south-east London who died after being hit by a bullet he had fired which ricocheted off a nearby car. Privately, despite all the extra effort, police think the level of homicides in London this year is on course to be around the same as the 135 killings seen in 2018."
70,crime,Johnson's crackdown on offenders will only entrench crime,"It is “justice week” in the new Boris Johnson government, where “Britain’s Trump” is living up to the transatlantic comparison by laying down his vision for law and order in England and Wales. Johnson’s hardline approach will put more police on the streets, increase use of stop and search, and incarcerate more offenders with longer sentences. “I want criminals to be afraid, not the public,” read the headline to his Mail on Sunday column. But so far the prime minister appears to be getting tough on crime without being so tough on – or interested in – its causes. Under Johnson’s changes, more police officers, not just senior staff, will be able to authorise section 60 powers, which allow forces to designate specific areas where searches can take place without reasonable grounds of suspicion for a fixed period of time. This enlarged pool of officers will need a lower degree of certainty, so they must reasonably believe an incident involving serious violence “may” rather than “will” occur.   Graphic   The move unwinds one of the few more progressive moves made by his predecessor, Theresa May, who in 2014 restricted the use of section 60 as part of a broader package to limit the use of stop-and-search powers in the face of evidence that black people were far more likely to be stopped by the police than white people. This disproportionality continues. Black people make up 15.6% of London’s population, while white people make up 59.8%. In 2018, 43% of searches were of black people, while 35.5% were of white people, according to official figures released last year from the London mayor’s office for policing and crime. Johnson, as mayor of London, along with Kit Malthouse, his then deputy for policing, who is now the policing minister, vigorously promoted the intensive use of section 60 in parts of the capital from 2008 onwards as a means of tackling knife crime. Marian Fitzgerald, a former principal researcher in the Home Office research and statistics directorate and now visiting professor of criminology at the University of Kent, said this did nothing to reduce knife crime and inflamed tensions between communities and the police. “Far from reducing knife crime, the Johnson-Malthouse approach further entrenched a problem, which has become more intractable ever since,” she said. “In doing so, they were also replicating the conditions which gave rise to the riots which erupted in Brixton in 1981 and rapidly spread to other parts of the country. “At their height in London, between 2008 and 2011, the proportion of section 60 searches which resulted in an arrest for carrying an offensive weapon of any sort was consistently less than 0.5%.”   Graphic   Up to £2.5bn has been promised by Johnson to create 10,000 additional prison places. But this is not a new initiative. A prison safety and reform white paper published in 2016 and the Conservative party manifesto for the 2017 snap election promised “to modernise the prison estate, replacing the most dilapidated prisons and creating 10,000 modern prison places”. The Ministry of Justice said the “first new prison” would be built at HMP Full Sutton – but Full Sutton has been earmarked for expansion since 2017. The ministry has been seeking permission to expand the capacity to more than 1,400, but the proposals have been met with significant objections in the local area. But even if the policy was new, it goes against the grain of evidence that suggests ex-home secretary Michael Howard’s “prisons works” mantra is flawed. Peter Dawson, the director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: “Doing away with overcrowded and outdated prisons makes a lot of sense. But governments have been promising that for decades, and they always underestimate what’s involved. “According to the prison service’s own figures, it would take 9,000 new spaces just to eliminate overcrowding – not a single dilapidated prison could be taken out of use before that figure was reached.”  Not only will more prison places be created under Johnson’s brand of justice, but prisoners could be locked up for longer too. Violent and sexual offenders will be the subject of a review of sentencing, as will the most prolific offenders. The general rule that a prisoner serving a fixed-term sentence is normally released automatically halfway through their sentence will be reviewed. But Johnson is reportedly set to trash the work of former justice secretary David Gauke, who struck a refreshing tone in his approach to prison, welcomed across the criminal justice sector. Gauke, who was praised by experts as taking a balanced and evidence-based approach, advocated moving away from ineffective short-term sentences, as figures show about two-thirds of offenders on prison terms of less than 12 months reoffend, compared with a third of those given a court order. Christina Marriott, the chief executive of the Revolving Doors Agency charity, said: “Any review of sentencing should take a good, hard look at short-sighted short prison sentences.” She said a broad consensus among experts and practitioners was “bolstered by the government’s own data, which shows that short prison sentences drive up crime and make people less safe”. The efficacy of Johnson’s policies will continue to be vigorously debated. But there seems to be greater agreement that this wave of populist, headline-grabbing tough-on-crime policies are further evidence that Johnson is simply gearing up to fight a general election. Charlotte Pickles, director of the Reform thinktank, said: “Boris Johnson’s criminal justice reforms are a monumental waste of money. His proposed sentencing reforms ignore evidence that shows that longer prison sentences are ineffective at deterring crime or reducing reoffending. “His unequivocal embrace of stop and search is dumbfounding – research shows it does little to prevent violence. Intelligent investment is clearly needed, but these pledges are costly election baubles, not a serious attempt to make this country safer.”"
71,crime,Boris Johnson’s ‘crime fighting’ crusade is mere posturing,"The most pressing issue facing Britain this month is not its falling crime rate. Yes, that reads falling crime rate – it has, indeed, been falling since 1995. The trouble is that it is not falling faster than Boris Johnson’s electoral prospects. Hence a month-long blitz of headline-seeking announcements on “fighting crime”. We have had 20,000 more police, 10,000 more prison places, enhanced powers of stop-and-search and convicts to get “the sentences they deserve” – a concept of Trumpian fatuity. The much-trumpeted idea that Johnson is some sort of Tory liberal in disguise is ridiculous.   Related: Will PM's police hiring spree make streets safer?    Any cynical politician can trawl through what are called “police-recorded crime statistics” and find a few to suit the macho moment. In Britain, such figures serve to boost police budgets, stir fear and anti-immigrant hate and lead to the highest incarceration rate in western Europe. They have nothing to do with crime. As proper statisticians know, police-recorded crime is about police activity and a propensity to report. Hence currently “soaring” historic sex crime. The only reliable figures are from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (there are separate ones for Scotland and Northern Ireland), which receive no publicity as they have been falling for a quarter of a century, probably as the nation prospers. Where there appears to have been a genuine increase is in violent crime related to the illicit drugs industry, to “county lines” dealing networks and the growth of gangs. Yet the government of which Johnson is now leader has spent a decade cutting back on rehabilitation and probation, and starving anti-gang youth support. Prison conditions are reportedly deteriorating almost by the week. Theresa May stymied efforts to cut incarceration rates. Through all this, the key dysfunction underlying a significant amount of serious crime, the illegality of recreational drugs, is effectively “sponsored” by Home Office primitivism. The hottest spots for drug use are the government’s own jails, which the prime minister wants to expand. Criminology libraries groan with evidence rejecting the idea that longer sentences, more imprisonment, more police and tougher stop-and-search bring down crime. They are a return to the dark ages. The causes of crime in Britain lie embedded in the social economy. They lie in stupid and unenforceable laws and, nowadays, in the inadequate regulation of the internet. The answers lie in tedious and unspectacular remedies, such as school and community institutions, in the design of cities and the care of vulnerable families. Britain is not a crime-ridden country and it is cynical hypocrisy to maintain otherwise. Johnson is about to become surely the first prime minister in modern history to needlessly inflict a crushing economic sanction on his own country – purely to help him win his party leadership. He should at least concentrate on mitigating that blow, not on populist electioneering. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"
72,crime,Fighting online disability hate crime,"Disability hate crime is an issue we face every day, but is not often talked about (Report, 10 May). Figures showing that online disability hate crime has hit record levels in England and Wales are very concerning, and highlight that we need to talk about the issue in order to tackle it. For too long, I and other people with learning disabilities have been excluded from digital spaces out of fear of abuse. We have a right to feel safe online. What needs to change is the behaviour of the abusers, not the victims. Through #ImWithSam, we have been campaigning to raise awareness of this issue among policymakers, the general public and, crucially, among people with learning disabilities, so that they recognise when a crime is happening and what they can do about it. So far, we’ve trained more than 1,000 police officers to help tackle learning disability hate crime. Online disability hate crime should have tougher laws. Abusers should be prosecuted, and their profiles taken down. Social media companies also have a role to play. They should make their safety procedures easier to understand, so people with learning disabilities know how to better protect ourselves. This cannot continue. We need change now – and I hope that the government takes the problem of online hate crime seriously, so people with disabilities are free to express themselves online, free from fear.Mark BrookesCampaigns adviser, Dimensions • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

73,crime,Youth clubs and knife crime,"Statistics quoted in the Guardian confirm that there is a correlation between swingeing cuts to youth services across England and the high incidence of knife crime committed by young people in some communities (Report, 7 May) The closure of much-needed youth clubs is only the tip of the iceberg because professionally managed and delivered youth provision encapsulates the whole range of services designed to meet the developmental needs of young people, from outreach work, advice and information drop-in sessions, anger management and conflict resolution, to drugs and alcohol advice sessions. For many young people living in deprived communities, local youth clubs have often been the springboard to opportunities that lead to meaningful employment and lifelong volunteering, and participants have developed a range of skills such as resilience, personal safety and leadership. Outdoor activities and youth-led drama and arts initiatives have been decimated by a government that appears to be driven by austerity measures, with little consideration for ordinary young people. Although the prime minister has invited a range of professionals to discuss the implications of knife crime in meetings at No 10, the fact that professional youth workers do not appear to have been included is very significant.Norma HornbyWarrington, Cheshire • The all-party parliamentary group’s recognition in its report on knife crime of the positive role played by youth clubs and other youth work provision in young people’s lives is welcome, if somewhat overdue. The report also adds valuable evidence to that gathered since at least 2014 – for example, by the trade union Unison – on the huge budget cuts to local authority youth services that have resulted in the loss of hundreds of clubs and thousands of jobs. For youth workers, however, the committee’s starting point and primary focus also carry risks. One stems from its at least implicit preconception of young people as problems with deficits that need to be eradicated. This contrasts sharply with what for most youth workers has to be their top preoccupation: the untapped and perhaps even unrecognised potential of the young people who, by their own choice, have engaged with them. A second risk, flowing from this, is that any new funding provided for youth work on the back of this report’s recommendations will, in the words of the Cambridgeshire spokesperson, be “targeted … for those children and young people who are most vulnerable”. Where in these updated forms of “child saving” will there be a priority for what another APPG report defined as “non-formal education that focuses on the personal and social development of participants … through engagement with young people’s culture and community”?Bernard DaviesAuthor of Austerity, Youth Policies and the Deconstruction of the Youth Service in England, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

74,crime,Rural crime in Britain hits seven-year high,"Rural crime has hit a seven-year high, costing the UK £50m in 2018, a report says. In its annual study of offences against farmers and rural businesses, the insurer NFU Mutual found rural crime in 2018 was up 12% on the previous year. The insurer said farmers and country people were having to deal with “repeated thefts by gangs who take advantage of farms’ isolated locations to steal machinery, raid tool stores and even butcher sheep in the fields”. The report says the sharp rise was driven mainly by the theft of tractors, quad bikes and other farm vehicles, which was up 26% in 2018. The cost of agricultural vehicle theft claims to NFU Mutual rose by 26% to £7.4m in 2018. Quad bike and other vehicle theft claims rose from £2.3m in 2017 to £2.6m in 2018. Claims for stolen livestock increased from £2.4m to £2.5m. Tim Price, a rural affairs specialist at NFU Mutual, said the last time rural theft reached such levels was in 2011 when international gangs “took advantage of a largely unsecured countryside”. “Today, we are seeing another rise as organised criminal gangs with links to money laundering and drugs find ways to beat security and steal farm vehicles,” he said.   Rural crime   The biggest increase in rural crime was in Scotland, up 62%, although its rural crime cost remained below the UK average. The north-east had the second highest regional rise, at 25%, and East Anglia the third highest, 22%. The cost of rural theft fell in two regions: Wales, down 7%, and the south-west, down 1%. “In a single generation, country people have seen rural crime change from the opportunist theft of a single lamb to brazen heists of tractors worth over £100,000 and rustlers stealing hundreds of sheep,” Price said. “We are even seeing agricultural vehicles being stolen to smash into village shops to rob cash machines. As well as causing huge structural damage to buildings, these raids can lead to shop owners not replacing ATMs for fear of further attacks.”"
75,crime,Senior ICC judges authorise Afghanistan war crimes inquiry,"Senior judges at the international criminal court have authorised an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Afghanistan, overturning an earlier rejection of the inquiry. The ICC investigation will look at actions by US, Afghan and Taliban troops. It is possible, however, that allegations relating to UK troops could emerge in that process. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, on Thursday attacked the ruling by the ICC’s appeals chamber as “reckless” and said it would outline measures in the coming weeks to prevent US citizens being brought before the court. “This is a truly breathtaking action by an unaccountable political institution masquerading as a legal body,” Pompeo told a news conference following the ruling. “All the more reckless for this ruling to come just days after the United States signed a historic peace deal on Afghanistan, which is the best chance for peace in a generation.” The ICC judges also approved that the scope of the investigation should include CIA black sites operated in Poland, Lithuania, and Romania, where detainees were taken. The court had last year rejected the request to open an investigation and said any prosecution was unlikely to be successful because the expectation was that those targeted, including the US, Afghan authorities and the Taliban, would not cooperate. Pompeo said at the time that Washington would revoke or deny visas to ICC staff seeking to investigate alleged war crimes and other abuses committed by US forces in Afghanistan or elsewhere. The court’s chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, later confirmed that her US visa had been revoked. But on Thursday the ICC’s appeals chamber said the lower court had misinterpreted some of the court’s rules, and it declared that the investigation should be allowed to go ahead.  Jamil Dakwar, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s human rights programme, said: “This decision vindicates the rule of law and gives hope to the thousands of victims seeking accountability when domestic courts and authorities have failed them. “While the road ahead is still long and bumpy, this decision is a significant milestone that bolsters the ICC’s independence in the face of the Trump administration’s bullying tactics.” Reading out the decision, the chair of the appeals tribunal, Piotr Hofmański, said: “The prosecutor is authorised to commence investigation in relation to events dating back to 2003 as well as other alleged crimes [related to] Afghanistan.”  Bensouda has said there is information that members of the US military and intelligence agencies committed acts of torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, rape and sexual violence against conflict-related detainees in Afghanistan and other locations, principally in the early years of the conflict. She has also said the Taliban and other insurgent groups have killed more than 17,000 Afghan civilians since 2009 and that Afghan security forces are suspected of torturing prisoners at government detention centres. Preetha Gopalan, the deputy head of UK litigation at the human rights organisation Reprieve, said: “This decision is welcome news to everyone who believes that the perpetrators of war crimes should not enjoy impunity, no matter how powerful they are. “This is the first time the US will be held to account for its actions, even though it tried to bully the ICC into shutting this investigation down. That the ICC did not bow to that pressure, and instead upheld victims’ right to accountability, gives us hope that no one is beyond the reach of justice.” Ahmed Rabbani, a Pakistani taxi driver who was rendered to Afghanistan and tortured for 540 days by US personnel, was among the victims who supported the appeal. He has been held in Guantánamo since 2004 without charge or trial. In a statement released through Reprieve, he said: “If the people who tortured me are investigated and prosecuted, I will be very happy. I would ask just one thing from them: an apology. If they are willing to compensate me with $1m for each year I have spent here, that will not be enough. I am still going through suffering and torture at present. But I would be happy with just three words: ‘We are sorry.’” The decision last year to halt the investigation provoked dismay among international human rights organisations and allegations that the ICC had caved in to bullying by the Trump administration. One line of investigation the ICC prosecutors were following involved the CIA’s alleged mistreatment of detainees. Nikki Reisch, Counsel for the global justice clinic at NYU School of Law, said: “On behalf of our client, Mohammed al-Asad and his surviving family, we applaud the [ICC] Appeals Chamber for rejecting the repugnant logic of the US torture programme, which sought to place detainees in a legal black hole and deny them access to justice for the abuses they suffered. At a time when authoritarian tendencies are on the rise, the decision sends an important signal to all states that might does not make right, and that no one is above the law.” Katherine Gallagher, of the Center for Constitutional Rights, said: “Today, the International Criminal Court breathed new life into the mantra that ‘no one is above the law’ and restored some hope that justice can be available – and applied -to all. For more than 15 years, like too many other victims of the US torture program, Sharqawi Al-Hajj and Guled Duran have suffered physically and mentally in unlawful US detention, while former senior US officials have enjoyed impunity. “In authorising this critical and much-delayed investigation into crimes in and related to Afghanistan, the Court made clear that political interference in judicial proceedings will not be tolerated.” The ICC, which began operations in The Hague in 2002, is a court of last resort for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity allegedly committed by nationals of a signatory state or that allegedly took place on the territory of one of its member states."
76,crime,"Russia committed war crimes in Syria, finds UN report","A UN investigation into atrocities committed in Syria has for the first time accused Russia of direct involvement in war crimes for indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas. The latest report from the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria focuses on events of July 2019 to January this year, and in particular attacks by “pro-government forces” on civilian targets like medical facilities, driving 700,000 civilians from their homes.   Related: Idlib province bombing kills 21 in single day    The commission focused on two incidents in which it found substantial evidence that Russian aircraft were directly involved in the bombing of civilian areas. The panel has in the past suggested possible Russian responsibility for war crimes, but this is the first time it has found proof of Moscow’s culpability. The first incident was a series of air strikes on a market place in Ma’arrat al-Nu’man, a densely populated area 33 km south of Idlib city, on 22 July. The commission report describes the attack as a “double tap” air strike, in which a second wave of bombing hit the same target when rescue workers were on the site. Forty-three civilians, including four children, were killed and at least 109 injured. The second attack investigated was the 16 August bombing of a compound for displaced civilians standing alone in fields just outside Haas in southern Idlib governorate. That attack killed 20 people, including eight women and six children, and injured 40 others. “Based on the evidence available, including witness testimonies, video footage, data imagery as well as reports by flight spotters, flight communication intercepts and early warning observation reports, the commission has reasonable grounds to believe that a Russian aircraft participated in each incident described above,” the report said. “In both incidents, the Russian Air Force did not direct the attacks at a specific military objective, amounting to the war crime of launching indiscriminate attacks in civilian areas.” Russia has denied responsibility for the mass killing of civilians in Syria, insisting its air campaign in support of the Damascus regime is solely targeted against terrorist groups. While frequently condemning daily atrocities in Syria, the UN usually seeks to avoid naming those responsible. It relies on the government of Bashar al-Assad and its Russian backers to distribute humanitarian relief around much of the country. The commission of inquiry is made up of three independent experts, Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro a Brazilian legal scholar, Karen Koning AbuZayd, a veteran American UN official, and an Egyptian human rights expert, Hanny Megally. The panel was established by the Human Rights Council in 2011 to provide continuing reports on human rights violations in the Syrian conflict.   Related: 'We have nothing left': displaced Syrians wait out war in Idlib    “This is a huge development,” said Charles Lister, a Syria expert at the Middle East Institute. “The UN very rarely attributes attacks like this, and it is really important that they do so in a report like this. Given the position of the UN in Syria though, it’s not surprising it is tucked away in the report and they haven’t made a big thing of it.” The Russian-backed government offensive on Idlib has caused a mass exodus of refugees towards the Turkish border and direct confrontation between Turkish and Russian forces. • This article was amended on 4 March 2020. An earlier version incorrectly described a “mass exodus of refugees into Turkey”. The refugees travelled towards the Turkish border, but it is currently sealed."
77,crime,"Coronavirus threats are crimes, says CPS after spate of cough attacks","Prosecutors have said anyone making threats of coronavirus infection will face serious criminal charges, after reports of police officers, shop workers and vulnerable people being deliberately coughed at by people claiming to have the disease. 
The Crown Prosecution Service said such behaviour could constitute common assault, and attacks on emergency workers specifically were punishable by up to two years in prison. 
In one incident an RSPCA officer trying to rescue an injured swan was abused and spat at by teenagers who told her to “have corona”. 
Max Hill QC, the director of public prosecutions, said: “Emergency workers are more essential than ever as society comes together to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. I am therefore appalled by reports of police officers and other frontline workers being deliberately coughed at by people claiming to have Covid-19. 
“Let me be very clear: this is a crime and needs to stop. The CPS stands behind emergency and essential workers and will not hesitate to prosecute anybody who threatens them as they go about their vital duties.” 
 
  
  
   
    What do the restrictions involve?
    
    People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:
    
     Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible
     One form of exercise a day – for example a run, walk, or cycle – alone or with members of your household
     Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person
     Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home
    
    Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:
    
     Close all shops selling non-essential goods, including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship
     Stop all gatherings of more than two people in public – excluding people you live with
     Stop all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals
    
    Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.
    
   
  
  
 
On Wednesday Darren Rafferty, 45, admitted to three counts of assaulting an emergency worker after claiming to have coronavirus and directing coughs at Metropolitan police officers arresting him for another offence. He will sentenced at Snaresbrook crown court next week. 
Another man, David Mott, 40, was jailed on Wednesday after threatening to spit at police officers in Blackburn who had asked him what he was doing out with two others following the government’s announcement of stricter physical distancing rules on Monday night. 
Appearing at Blackburn magistrates court, Mott admitted possession of an offensive weapon, possession of a class B drug and threatening behaviour. He was jailed for 26 weeks. 
Leanne Honess-Heather, an RSPCA officer, said she was approached by five boys aged between 16 and 17 as she tried to help a stranded swan at Rush Lyvars fishing lake in Hullon Saturday. She said they abused her after she asked them to step back.  
“They seemed to take offence to this, which led to two of the group spitting directly into my face, going in my mouth and eyes, as they yelled ‘have corona bitch’ at me,” she said. 
Stricter guidance strengthening the CPS’s approach to assaults on emergency workers was published in January after analysis revealed it had prosecuted almost 20,000 cases in the first year in which attacks on emergency workers were made a specific offence. 
Police chiefs said on Tuesday that the coronavirus pandemic could “bring out the worst in humanity” after a spate of opportunistic crimes hindered efforts to control the crisis.

78,crime,UK organised crime gangs profit most in Europe from darknet drugs sales – report,"Organised crime groups based in the UK generate more money from selling illegal drugs on the dark web than in any other country in Europe, according to the EU’s drugs agency. Darknet vendors in the UK were estimated to have sold drugs worth more than £24m with a total weight of 2,825kg in 2017-18. Although they did not generate as much revenue, dark web vendors in Germany were estimated to have traded a higher quantity of drugs, 3,153kg, worth over £16m. The disparity could reflect price variations and the differences in types of drugs offered. However, the true figures were almost certainly much higher. Including on the darknet, drug users across the EU spend more than £26bn on illicit substances each year. A number of online marketplaces where drugs are sold have been closed in recent years by international law enforcement agencies, but the dark web markets ecosystem has proved resilient and take-downs did not significantly impact revenues, the 2019 EU drug markets report noted. The report said the number of online stores run by single vendors had grown in response, and the market was expected to continue to both fragment and migrate to encrypted communication apps such as Discord and Telegram. It is estimated that the number of people in England who buy drugs on the dark web has more than doubled since 2014 amid similar rises in other countries. Darknet vendors in the UK sell mainly cocaine and cannabis, along with stimulants such as MDMA and dissociatives including ketamine.   Related: The white stuff: why Britain can’t get enough cocaine    However, a number of vendors in the UK also sell fentanyl, a powerful painkiller 50 times stronger than heroin. Some UK-based fentanyl vendors recruit criminals in other countries where they enjoy large customer bases to sell the dangerous opioid on their behalf, according to the report. The use of postal and parcel services to transport drugs has expanded rapidly in the past two years, posing added dilemmas for law enforcement agencies. Dr James Nicholls, from Transform Drug Policy Foundation, said the report showed that international law enforcement agencies were finding it “almost impossible” to deal with the expansion and innovation of the illicit drug market. “Research cited in the report shows that when one darknet market is taken down another takes its place, having no effect on the overall scale of the drug market,” he said. “Law enforcement are playing ‘whack-a-mole’ and it is not working. We need a different approach. The only way to undermine organised crime, and to reduce the enormous harm that illegal drug markets create, is to legally regulate drug supply.”   Related: The Guardian view on the case for legalising drugs: time to be reasonable | Editorial    The director of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, which compiled the report, said it represented “a clear wake-up call for policymakers” to address an “increasingly global, joined-up and digitally enabled” rapidly growing drug market. “Hyper-production of drugs, within and beyond EU borders, is leading to high availability of natural and synthetic substances,” Alexis Goosdeel said. “This means that consumers now have access to a diverse range of highly potent and pure products at affordable prices.”"
79,crime,Men accused of raping girl in Spanish town convicted of lesser crime,"A Barcelona court has acquitted five men accused of raping a 14-year-old girl of the most serious charges of sexual aggression and convicted them instead of sexual abuse on the grounds that the victim was under the influence of drugs and alcohol. The five men were jailed for between 10 and 12 years on the charge of continuous sexual abuse. A sixth man was acquitted on the grounds that he had not actively participated in the incident, in the town of Manresa, in north-east Spain. The prosecution had asked for the men to be convicted of sexual aggression, which carries a 15 to 20-year sentence, stating that the victim had been unable to defend herself. However, the court ruled the men “were able to carry out these sexual acts without resorting to violence or intimidation” because the victim was “in an unconscious state” from drugs and alcohol “and didn’t know what she was or wasn’t doing”. The victim was awarded €12,000 (£10,300) compensation for an attack the court described as “extremely intense and particularly degrading”. The judges rejected a claim by the accused that they were unaware the girl was under 16 and so below the age of consent. The attack took place at a party in an abandoned factory in October 2016. The case has been dubbed the Manresa manada, after the notorious case of the five men calling themselves La Manada, or the “wolf pack”, who were jailed for 15 years earlier this year for the rape of an 18-year-old woman during the running of the bulls in Pamplona in 2016. The Pamplona case led to an outcry and triggered protests across Spain after the five were initially cleared of gang rape but convicted of the lesser charge of sexual abuse. In June, the supreme court in Madrid overturned the lower court’s verdict, ruling that the victim had been subjected to “a genuinely intimidating scenario in which she never consented to the sexual acts perpetrated by the accused”. The case also prompted the then government to announce a review of Spain’s sexual offences legislation. Altamira Gonzalo, of the women jurists’ group Themis, condemned Thursday’s verdict. “The Barcelona court continues to believe that women must put up a heroic resistance,” Gonzalo said. “They have taken a benevolent view of men who, with their trousers round their ankles, took turns at raping a 14-year-old girl who, as well as being under the effects of alcohol, was in a situation where she couldn’t defend herself.” She added: “The judges have had no difficulty seeing this from the point of view of the aggressors but that not of the victim.” Viviana Waisman, president of the human rights group Women’s Link Worldwide, also expressed concerns over the verdict. “From the media reports we’ve seen of the Maresa case, we believe that [the court] could have viewed the situation as intimidating for the victim, given she was a minor in an abandoned space with several attackers who were older than her,” said Waisman. “The supreme court’s ruling in the Pamplona wolf pack case clarified the concept of ‘environmental intimidation’ and looked at things from a gender perspective.” Given that, she added, the judges could have come to the conclusion that sexual aggression had been committed and ruled accordingly. Giving evidence in July, the Manresa victim said one of the accused was a friend with whom she had had sexual relations a week earlier and whom she trusted. She said he was the one who led her to the shack where he raped her and then invited his friends to do likewise, telling them they each had 15 minutes. While under English law sex with a minor is statutory rape whether consent is given or not, a lawyer at the Madrid branch of Women’s Link said that in Spain the question hinged on whether violence and intimidation were used, with the criteria the same for both minors and adults."
80,crime,"Make environmental damage a war crime, say scientists","International lawmakers should adopt a fifth Geneva convention that recognises damage to nature alongside other war crimes, according to an open letter by 24 prominent scientists. The legal instrument should incorporate wildlife safeguards in conflict regions, including protections for nature reserves, controls on the spread of guns used for hunting and measures to hold military forces to account for damage to the environment, say the signatories to the letter, published in the journal Nature. The UN international law commission is due to hold a meeting with the aim of building on the 28 principles it has already drawn up to protect the environment in war zones. Prof Sarah Durant of the Zoological Society of London, one of the signatories to the letter, said the principles were a major step forward and should be expanded to make specific mention of biodiversity, and then adopted across the world. “The brutal toll of war on the natural world is well documented, destroying the livelihoods of vulnerable communities and driving many species, already under intense pressure, towards extinction,” she said. “We hope governments around the world will enshrine these protections into international law. This would not only help safeguard threatened species, but would also support rural communities, both during and post-conflict, whose livelihoods are long-term casualties of environmental destruction.” Work in this field began in the 1990s after the Iraqi military set fire to more than 600 oil wells during a scorched-earth retreat from Kuwait in 1991, but the idea dates back at least to the Vietnam war, when the US military used Agent Orange to clear millions of hectares of forest with dire consequences for human health and wildlife. More recently, the effects of conflict have been evident in the Sahara-Sahel region, where collapsing populations of cheetahs, gazelles and other species have been linked to the spread of guns following Libya’s civil war. Battles in Mali and Sudan have resulted in a rise in the number of elephant killings. José Brito of the University of Porto, another signatory, said: “The impacts of armed conflict are causing additional pressure to imperilled wildlife from the Middle East and north Africa. Global commitment is needed to avoid the likely extinction of emblematic desert fauna over the next decade.”"

82,crime,"‘When you go to the police, you think everything will be OK’: the woman fighting for victims of crime","Claire Waxman is drinking tea from a white mug bearing the slogan: “I’m not bossy, I just have better ideas.” It was a present from her daughter, she explains, rather than her colleagues, but for the record, London’s first commissioner for victims certainly is brimming with ideas. Having published the London Rape Review last summer, a study of more than 500 rape cases exploring why prosecution rates are so low, Waxman is about to launch a crucial piece of research on one controversial aspect of the process: the requirement for rape complainants to hand over their mobile phones for police examination. Reading text messages that may shed light on any relationship with the accused is one thing, says Waxman, but she is concerned that the practice is leading to far broader digital fishing expeditions that drag out investigations and lead to victims dropping out. Victims, she believes, are being treated more like suspects. “It’s adding on six months, if not longer, on investigations,” says Waxman, whose initial review found it now takes almost a year from reporting an attack to a file being submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). “The longer it takes, [the greater] the impact on the victim and the likelihood of them withdrawing from the process, because in that time frame they can’t really access counselling services freely – they’re told that if they do so, their notes may be requested by the police and the CPS.” The entire process, she says, is far too “invasive ... The whole way in which we structure these investigations is very much against the rape victim and against their ability to cope and recover.” Some 58% of alleged victims in her review had dropped out before their case reached court – many citing the distress caused by reliving the details during the investigation or a desire to move on from a traumatic experience. (Interestingly, the attrition rate was three times higher for female rape victims than male ones). The issue of so-called digital disclosure shot to public attention in 2017, after a handful of high-profile rape trials collapsed following phone messages or pictures coming to light. After that, says Waxman, police started routinely asking for mobiles to be handed over, and she has heard some hair-raising stories about the way private information has been used. She was particularly struck by one case in a which a woman had a recording app on her phone, which she used for work meetings. “She didn’t realise the app often stayed on and continued recording, and so it recorded conversations between her and her partner. Those conversations were then listened to by the police.” The woman was asked by the police “in quite an attacking way” why she had discussed the case at home with her partner. “It was quite shocking because they were looking at material that really shouldn’t be looked at, because it’s like surveillance. It’s almost like going into a coffee shop where you’re sitting with your partner or friend discussing, as you would, what’s happening in your life, personal things, and a police officer recording that.” The case was subsequently dropped. Another rape survivor was horrified to find a selfie in which she was smiling, taken hours before she was attacked, being used out of context in court. “They used it to say: ‘Look, she looks very happy’, but they didn’t talk about the time it was taken. And she had no right to respond.” Waxman’s review will look at what intimate information police are asking for, what impact wading through vast caches of phone data has on the length of investigations, and how much of it is ultimately useful in court. “I speak to the judiciary about it and they say: ‘I’m not interested in what she said to her friend about sex.’ But the police and CPS position has been very much about: ‘Get everything and then we’ll see what’s reasonable, what we need to consider, because there could be something in that that undermines the case.’” Even in cases of stranger rape where there is no relationship with the accused to examine, she says, school or medical records are routinely scrutinised for anything potentially affecting the victim’s credibility. The Metropolitan police is currently trialling a data-search tool called Magnet, to see if it can sift out relevant information from victims’ phones without undue invasion of privacy. But Waxman’s hunch is that some legal constraints on what can appropriately be accessed may be necessary. “If you think about the younger generation and how they use their phones – they don’t speak on a phone, everything is recorded and sent as a voice message. So everything is on there, every thought, every feeling.” It’s clear that, after two and a half years at City Hall, Waxman still approaches the job from the perspective of someone who has herself been a victim of crime. She was stalked for more than a decade by a former fellow student at her sixth-form college, who repeatedly defied court orders to stay away; the experience prompted her to found the charity Voice4Victims, campaigning for improved legislation for victims of crime generally. She recently revealed that, 14 years on, she was still waiting for a court-ordered compensation payment. She is clearly uncomfortable discussing her experience now – she deliberately doesn’t use her stalker’s name in interviews – and thought hard about the risks of taking a job that might bring her to public attention. But she says the experience taught her how vulnerable victims can feel. “You have this misconception that when you report to the police, everything will then be OK. I think the very sobering and sad realisation is that not only is it often not OK, it makes it far worse for that individual because of how fragmented the justice system is, how a victim is very much the afterthought throughout the entire process. “You’ve already been disempowered by whatever happened and that justice process only works to disempower you further.” She lost count of the number of times she had to take her stalker to court but “each time I vowed never to go back into it again because it was so awful. But I didn’t see any other way out. It was all-consuming, highly traumatic, re-victimising.” Waxman is delighted that the Met has established a stalker threat assessment centre, a pilot project seeking to identify at an early stage obsessively fixated stalkers who may not be deterred by the law. Police attitudes have improved, she says. However, “I still get regular cases coming to me and I’m looking at it thinking: ‘I can’t believe the police haven’t gripped this.’ It concerns me that we’re still not recognising a lot of these behaviours.” Elsewhere in her work, she welcomes potential moves to curb the so-called “rough sex” defence used in several recent murder trials, by men claiming to have strangled or beaten women to death in sex games gone wrong. (The former Labour minister Harriet Harman has led moves to tighten the law, as part of a domestic abuse bill going through parliament this spring.) “It’s being used far more widely now as a defence and it’s incredibly concerning, because these victims are not consenting to be killed.” Waxman is concerned about whether there will be enough money to make good on the bill’s central premise, a duty on local authorities to provide enough refuge places for women fleeing domestic violence. “With all these things, unless there is proper investment and sustainable funding, the issue on the ground is that victims and survivors really struggle to access quality and specialist support services.” Years of cutbacks to the police, CPS and courts have had a “huge impact” on the service that victims of crime receive. “The whole system has been stripped away over the last decade. I don’t say this lightly: the justice system has been creaking for years and it’s at breaking point; it needs proper investment.” Which brings us to the role of Priti Patel, the home secretary. Patel has campaigned for stronger victims’ rights since she was a backbencher and Waxman, who has had several meetings with her over the years, stresses that she has never found Patel anything other than “very supportive” and “very lovely to me”. But does she think the home secretary makes a credible champion of victims with bullying allegations hanging over her? “Not currently now, unfortunately. Whether there’s truth in the allegations or not I don’t know, but obviously that does impact her currently. If you are committed to supporting victims, you don’t really want to be accused of creating victims or making someone a victim of abuse.” Her current post is in the mayor of London’s gift, and with Sadiq Khan up for re-election in May, Waxman cannot be entirely sure what the future holds for her. But she clearly intends to make the most of whatever time she has. “It’s a role that should be here regardless of who the mayor is; without it one doesn’t know what’s happening on the ground for victims and survivors. It’s influenced so much change not just here in London but the national agenda,” she says. “I’m not political, for me it’s all cross-party work. I just want the work done for victims.” And with that, she heads back to her desk, clutching the cold tea she hasn’t had time to drink. • This article was amended on 12 March 2020. Earlier versions said the attrition rate was three times higher for male rape victims than female ones, when it is three times higher for female than male. "
83,crime,The best recent crime and thrillers – review roundup,"    If your idea of a cold war thriller is a “white saviour” hero with conservative values rescuing the world from the Soviet menace, think again: American Spy (Dialogue, £14.99), Lauren Wilkinson’s intelligent and pacy debut set against the background of a real coup d’état, injects new life into this tired formula. It’s 1987, and black FBI agent Marie Mitchell, her career stalled by racism and sexism, is recruited by the CIA as the bait in a honeytrap. The target is Burkina Faso’s president Thomas Sankara, and the aim is to destabilise his fledgling government, whose Marxist leanings run counter to American interests. Despite misgivings, Mitchell accepts the job; once in West Africa, and having become emotionally involved with her subject, she is increasingly ambivalent about what she is doing, and why. Written as a record for her sons after an attempt on her life five years later, this is a complex, powerful story of divided loyalties, double consciousness and moral ambiguity.      Spy novels by women tend to be few and far between, so it’s an unexpected pleasure when two come along at once. Charlotte Philby is the granddaughter of double agent Kim Philby; having a spy in the family may be the reason why her first novel, The Most Difficult Thing (Borough, £12.99), is a blend of espionage and domestic suspense. Anna is besotted with secretive Harry, whose unnamed paymasters are very interested in the unscrupulous business dealings of their mutual friend David’s billionaire father. In order to obtain inside information, Harry encourages Anna into David’s arms, and marriage and children follow. Burdened with guilt from her childhood and lacking support, Anna becomes increasingly bewildered. Everyone has an agenda in this intriguing exploration of deceit and duplicity, as Philby rachets up the paranoia to Highsmithian levels.      In the hands of a lesser writer, the premise of The Chain (Orion, £12.99) would be preposterous, but Adrian McKinty has invested his conceit of a kidnapping pyramid scheme with an appalling plausibility. The technique of the chain letter is employed: for your child to be freed, you must not only pay a ransom but also kidnap somebody else’s kid to continue the sequence, and the consequences for anyone who refuses to cooperate are brutal. It is, as one of its architects says, “The goddamn Uber of kidnapping with the clients doing most of the work themselves.” When 13-year-old Kylie is snatched from a bus stop near her home in Massachusetts, her mother is plunged into a nightmare as she is forced to do the unthinkable in order to save her daughter. Told in a spare, punchy style, this is a blazing, full-tilt thriller that entirely justifies the hype. Read, and pass it on.      Alex Marwood’s fourth novel, The Poison Garden (Sphere, £12.99), begins with the Jonestown-style massacre of Doomsday cultists who live off-grid in the foothills of Snowdonia. Only 20-year-old Romy and a few of the children, including her two half-siblings (the leader has cherry-picked the most attractive women as sexual partners), have survived. The action flips between past and present as Romy struggles to understand the “Dead” – as the cult calls people in the outside world – and searches for the sister of her (really dead) mother. Romy’s aunt Sarah provides a parallel narrative; herself the product of a bizarre Christian sect, she is coming to terms with the strange nephew and niece that social services have foisted on her. Intelligently assimilated research, a slow build with a growing sense of unease and a chillingly believable plotline add up to the best sort of dark psychological thriller.      Although Guillaume Musso has topped the book charts in his native France for some years, The Reunion (translated by Frank Wynne, W&amp;N, £14.99) is the first of his novels to be published in the UK. In 1992, Vinca Rockwell, an American student at an elite boarding school on the Côte d’Azur, ran away with her philosophy tutor, Alexis Clément, and the pair were never seen again. That, at least, is the official version. Her friends know better: and when they attend a reunion 25 years later and discover that the gym is scheduled for demolition, they realise there is trouble ahead … There’s a cartoonish amount of melodrama as the complicated relationships, tragic misunderstandings, bodies and culprits pile up, but it’s a fun read, spiced with pop-cultural references.      Finally, a welcome reissue of a French classic. First published in 1966, The Lady in the Car with Glasses and a Gun by Sébastien Japrisot (translated by Helen Weaver, Gallic, £8.99) is the fever-dream tale of beautiful Dany, who decides, on a whim, to take her boss’s convertible for a joy ride. She heads south from Paris, but things get disconcerting when people she’s never met, in places she’s never been before, swear that they recognise both her and the distinctive vehicle. Far-fetched but utterly captivating, this is a perfect diversion for a sunny afternoon. • Laura Wilson’s The Other Woman is published by Quercus."
84,crime,The Captor review – sexy true-crime melodrama,"Since this diagnosis was invented, Stockholm syndrome has become almost a cliche: the psychological disorder making captives feel irrational loyalty and even love for the people holding them prisoner. But why? The victims’ unconscious need to rationalise their own humiliating submission? The brutal power relation of oppressor and oppressed creating its own attachment? Canadian film-maker Robert Budreau offers his own answers with a fictionalised version of that bizarre event that gave birth to the term – the extraordinary 1973 robbery in Stockholm during which an escaped convict stormed into a bank brandishing a submachine gun, took hostages, demanded his old cellmate be released from jail and brought to his side, and negotiated directly via telephone with Prime Minister Olof Palme himself. His traumatised, mesmerised captives came to believe that this charismatic robber was somehow on their side, against cops and politicians who might sacrifice them to show the world they were tough on crime. (Budreau’s script is based on Daniel Lang’s 1974 New Yorker article.)              Budreau has reinvented the robber, Kaj, as someone with an American background and Ethan Hawke has been cast in the role. (In real life, the Swedish culprit could in fact speak English with an American accent.) Noomi Rapace is the mousy and bespectacled bank teller Bianca who is so intensely thrilled by the life-or-death drama that she starts to fall for her assailant. The film slightly fudges the issue of whether they had sex.  Budreau’s keynote of black comedy depletes the tension and suspense, but this does feel plausible in its stranger-than-fiction chaos, and Budreau interestingly modifies an event from real life: Kaj persuades Bianca secretly to wear a bullet-proof vest so he can fake-shoot her, impressing the police with his ruthlessness. Hawke and Rapace show how this is a sado-masochistic act of love. An absurd or rather absurdist true-crime melodrama. "
85,crime,Is showing compassion to migrants a crime?,"On 11 June, a federal jury in Tucson, Arizona refused to convict the immigration activist Scott Warren on felony charges that could have sent him to prison for twenty years. What had Warren done to merit such extreme punishment? In January 2018, he committed the unconscionable act of offering food, water, and lodging to two migrants who had crossed the US-Mexico border without authorization. Warren is a member of the group No More Deaths, an organization founded in 2004 to stop the epidemic of migrant fatalities occurring in Arizona’s unforgiving Sonoran desert. Their work is constant, necessary, and honorable. After all, more than 7,000 people have perished crossing the US-Mexico border, according to US government statistics, though the actual number is almost certainly much higher. Over a third of those deaths are in the Arizona desert. But the work of No More Deaths is now under threat. While most Americans are aware that Trump has increased border enforcement since coming into office, fewer probably realize that migrants are not the only ones targeted by his administration. New guidelines issued by the then attorney general, Jeff Sessions, in 2017 order prosecutors to prioritize “any case involving the unlawful transportation or harboring of aliens”.   Related: Jurors refuse to convict activist facing 20 years for helping migrants    With Warren’s arrest, the Trump administration is putting humanitarianism itself on trial. (A hearing on 2 July will determine if Warren’s case proceeds.) That the jury deadlocked in this case is a small sign of hope for those of us who hold on to the basic, though essential, notion of our shared humanity. Make no mistake about it, however. Warren’s trial is yet another example of that specific kind of nastiness that is coming to define our age – one that venerates political borders over human life at almost any cost. Ours is an era when cruelty masquerades as policy and compassion is increasingly viewed as a crime. Nor is this solely an American phenomenon. All over the western world, governments are militarizing their borders, ratcheting up immigration enforcement, and prosecuting humanitarian workers. The British volunteer Tom Ciotkowski is currently on trial in France, facing up to five years in prison on assault and contempt charges. Last summer, Ciotkowski was filming French police checking the IDs of volunteers distributing food to refugees and migrants in Calais. When he observed a police officer pushing and kicking another volunteer, Ciotkowski complained, only to be pushed himself and then arrested. Amnesty International has taken up his case. Then there’s the case of the German boat captain Pia Klemp, currently facing criminal charges in Italy. Klemp is reported to have assisted in the rescue of more than 1,000 people in the burial waters known as the Mediterranean (where more than 18,000 people have died in the sea since 2014). Anti-migrant sentiment was already high in Italy, but with the rise of rightwing populists such as Italy’s interior minister, Matteo Salvini, the crackdown on migrants and humanitarian actors has expanded. Klemp faces up to 20 years in prison for assisting illegal immigration. More than 111,000 people have signed a petition demanding her release. Today’s criminalization of humanitarian assistance is sustained, widespread, and growing. A recent study by openDemocracy discovered that “more than 250 people across 14 countries have been arrested, charged, or investigated under a range of laws over the last five years for supporting migrants”. The study found that there had been a dramatic increase in this harassment over the last 18 months and that it had targeted such figures as “a priest nominated for the Nobel peace prize, a football player, firefighters, rural farmers, ex-soldiers, pensioners, a university professor and several local politicians”. The cases make for painful, if sometimes ridiculous, reading. The Swiss pastor Norbert Valley was arrested in the middle of a church service for sheltering a Togolese man who had just been denied asylum. A high-profile couple in Denmark were convicted of the crime of “harboring” for giving a Syrian migrant family a lift and taking them home for coffee and biscuits. A French mountain guide was charged last year with aiding and abetting illegal immigration after he rescued a Nigerian woman about to give birth in the snow and drove her to the hospital. He got lucky after prosecutors later dropped the charges, citing “humanitarian immunity”. She delivered her baby that night. Populists and nationalists will malign these humanitarian volunteers as witting or unwitting helpers of human traffickers, but that’s simply not true. There is not a shred of solid evidence to substantiate such a claim. The real danger lies not in the humanitarianism but in its criminalization. In both Europe and the United States, discourses about dangerous migrant hordes invading our civilized lands abound. The migrants, we’re told, pose a fundamental threat to our values, to who we are. But when our leaders make compassion itself a crime, just what set of values do they think they’re protecting? Who needs an invader when we can destroy ourselves, perfectly well, one trial of a humanitarian volunteer at a time.

86,crime,Insights... military service is not a magic bullet for reducing crime,"We’re in an era of “bring-backery” – blue passports are on the way and grammar schools would be if Theresa May had got her way. Any day now a politician is bound to call for the return of military conscription of our youths into national service. David Cameron was trying to get there with his National Citizens Service, before events, as they say, got in the way. Lots of countries still do this, especially if they’re near to Russia and its tendency to annex bits of other states. That’s not the issue for the UK, but politicians like the idea of military service knocking our wayward teenagers into shape, physically and otherwise. So is military conscription what 21st-century Britain needs to get discipline up and crime down? No, says an Economic Journal study of conscription in Sweden. Indeed, it has the exact opposite effect, with military service significantly increasing the chances of young men committing crime afterwards – convictions go up by 32%. The effect is driven by young men from disadvantaged groups or who had criminal histories. In part that is because military service means they are less likely to get established in jobs. In fact, conscription (even of the Swedish variety) widened inequality – reducing earnings and employment for those from disadvantaged groups while increasing incomes for those from more wealthy backgrounds.   Related: Macron’s national service sparks criticism from French left    So there’s a lot more our politicians can do to help the youth of today – from providing better job or housing security to doing something about climate change.

87,crime,Police report 16% rise in violent crime on Britain's railways,"The number of violent crimes recorded on Britain’s railways rose by 16% last year, official statistics show. In 2018-19, there were 13,591 such offences – including attempted murder and serious and common assault – compared with 11,671 in the previous year.   Related: Knife crime in England and Wales rises 8% over year    The British Transport Police (BTP), which published the figures, said preventing serious violence and knife crime on the rail network remained one of its highest priorities. There was also a significant rise in all crimes, with 68,313 offences recorded between 1 April last year and 31 March 2019 – a 12% increase on 2017-18. Adrian Hanstock, the deputy chief constable of the BTP, said the record number of passengers using the railways was behind the jump in crime rates. Theft, antisocial behaviour and shoplifting accounted for a large proportion of the overall increase “as stations become increasingly commercial environments”, he added. “Despite this increase, when put into context it is important to remember that the chance of becoming a victim of crime on the railway is very low,” Hanstock said. “Of course, any rise in crime is of concern to us and we are tackling this head on through our problem-solving initiatives at key locations.” The largest share of overall offences was recorded by BTP’s north of England division, where there were 27,377 offences last year. The division also had the largest number of recorded violent crimes in 2018-19, at 5,729. There were six homicides on British railways in 2018-19, including the murder of Lee Pomeroy, 51, who was stabbed to death after an argument on a train. The force also reported a surge in the number of vulnerable people it dealt with, including through providing mental health support. Officers and rail staff performed 2,529 lifesaving interventions, up 32% on the year before. Hanstock said: “It is troubling that the railway still attracts those in mental health crisis. Officers and rail staff work incredibly hard to safeguard those with vulnerabilities and help them access the most appropriate care and support.” He noted that “county lines” drug trafficking was of particular concern to the force. He said: “We’ve set up dedicated teams to oversee this important area of safeguarding, sharing valuable intelligence with our national partners, including the National Crime Agency. “As a result of our close collaboration with other law enforcement partners, large quantities of drugs have been seized and, importantly, a number of vulnerable youngsters have been protected from these toxic criminal networks.”"
88,crime,Chinese cyberhackers 'blurring line between state power and crime'," A group of state-sponsored hackers in China ran activities for personal gain at the same time as undertaking spying operations for the Chinese government in 14 different countries, the cybersecurity firm FireEye has said. In a report released on Thursday, the company said the hacking group APT41 was different to other China-based groups tracked by security firms in that it used non-public malware typically reserved for espionage to make money through attacks on video game companies.  FireEye said despite the group’s focus on financial gain, the espionage activity linked to it was more closely aligned with the behaviour of state-sponsored actors. APT41, which has been in operation since at least 2012, had repeatedly gained access to game development environments, with a particular focus on in-game currency, FireEye said. In one case, it generated tens of millions of dollars in the game’s virtual currency, which was then credited to more than 1,000 accounts.   Related: Australia joins condemnation of 'huge, audacious' Chinese hacking plot    FireEye said some of the group’s attention to video game companies could be seen as a precursor to espionage activity. In one case in 2014, it inserted malicious code into legitimate video game files in order to distribute malware. The group used similar methods to target supply chain companies. FireEye found an email address used in spear-phishing attacks for both a Taiwanese newspaper in 2016 and for a cryptocurrency exchange in 2018, suggesting email reuse by APT41, and also identified source code overlap in malware used in a 2016 attack on a US-based game development studio and supply chain compromises in 2017 and 2018. APT41 targets industries associated with China’s economic plans, or to gather intelligence for upcoming mergers and acquisitions, or political events. FireEye said APT41 had targeted organisations in 14 countries over seven years – France, India, Italy, Japan, Myanmar, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, South Africa, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the UK and the United States. The sectors targeted were healthcare, high tech, media, pharmaceuticals, retail, software companies, telecoms, travel services, education, video games and virtual currencies. Some of the espionage-related activity included intruding on a retailer planning an unpublicised partnership with a Chinese company, targeting telecommunications companies’ call records for data collection, and sending spear-phishing emails to Hong Kong media organisations known for pro-democracy editorial content. FireEye said that it assessed “with high confidence” that APT41 was attributable to Chinese nationals working on behalf of the Chinese state, and APT41’s capabilities and targeting had widened over time, potentially putting more organisations at risk. “APT41’s links to both underground marketplaces and state-sponsored activity may indicate the group enjoys protections that enables it to conduct its own for-profit activities, or authorities are willing to overlook them,” the report said. “It is also possible that APT41 has simply evaded scrutiny from Chinese authorities. Regardless, these operations underscore a blurred line between state power and crime that lies at the heart of threat ecosystems and is exemplified by APT41.” FireEye’s senior vice president of global threat intelligence, Sandra Joyce, said in a statement APT41 was well-resourced and skilled. “Their aggressive and persistent operations for both espionage and cybercrime purposes distinguish APT41 from other adversaries and make them a major threat across multiple industries.” APT41 is distinct from APT10, which the security firm Cybereason said in June had compromised at least 10 global telecommunications companies seeking to obtain data on high-value targets."
89,crime,Mother of Him review – unflinching crime drama with Tracy Ann Oberman,"Matthew Kapowitz is a Canadian teenager under house arrest for raping three girls. A storm of camera flashes are seen outside his home as a voracious media pack begins constructing its story of a middle-class family with a child-monster in its midst. We do not glimpse the world beyond his front door. Evan Placey’s potent play is about the seismic fractures such a crime creates inside the family home, although the power of the media to demonise the child criminal’s family is a major theme. This is contentious and courageous subject matter for the stage and Placey’s script addresses it unflinchingly. As in Bruce Norris’s Downstate, Placey does not set out to explain or humanise Matthew. He dramatises the dynamic between the supposed monster and those closest to him. Almost all of the characters are caught between guilt, bewilderment, culpability and anger at Matthew’s crime, and none more so than Brenda, his mother. Matthew (Scott Folan) remains a wan, inscrutable figure who does not account for his actions. This is the story of motherhood at its most tormented. Brenda is a single mother of two boys and a high-powered career woman. Tracy Ann Oberman’s steely eyed performance as Brenda shows her still to be desperate to “fix things”. She is caught between the rock and hard place of seeing Matthew’s actions as those of a rapist and those of a child – her child. Placey’s rich and multilayered script takes us into tough and rarely visited territory to ask difficult questions: to what degree is the mother of a child-rapist answerable for his actions? Where should Brenda’s allegiances lie? She questions her love for Matthew and speaks of hate. Other hard-edged sentiments are bravely spoken aloud; when she sees the rape victims for the first time she admits: “I resented them.”     Relevant as ever … Scott Folan, Tracy-Ann Oberman and Anjelica Serra. Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian    Her attempts to get answers out of Matthew are met with blankness and while his emotional repression reflects the inability to articulate reason or regret, it is frustrating on a dramatic level. The closest he gets to an explanation is a single, unfinished sentence to Brenda: “You know I never meant …” There is an occasional sense of emotional distance between actors in the toughest scenes, too, though there are moving moments between Brenda and her youngest son, Jason (Hari Aggarwal) to whom she can still show tenderness without feeling compromised.   Related: Playwright Evan Placey: 'I don’t censor the world for young people'    Matthew’s fate is cleverly foregrounded in the visual symbolism of Lee Newby’s monochrome grey set, which has a Lego-like quality, quickly rearranged from a bedroom to a kitchen to Matthew’s bedroom. It looks like a home while recalling the grey concrete of a prison. Based on a real event and first staged almost a decade ago, Mother of Him is as relevant as ever in its exploration of motherhood and troubled, problematic, porn-fed young masculinity. • At Park theatre, London, until 26 October."
90,crime,The girl in the box: the mysterious crime that shocked Germany,"In the Alpine foothills in the far south of Germany is a vast lake called the Ammersee. Its shores are dotted with centuries-old villages where wealthy families from Munich buy large second homes and tourists drink beer at waterfront restaurants. At the north end of the lake is a pair of such villages, Eching am Ammersee and Schondorf, less than two miles apart. Separating them is a block of spruce forest that attracts hunters, joggers, mountain bikers and in the late summer 38 years ago, kidnappers preparing to commit what would become one of the country’s most notorious postwar crimes.   Related: The girl in the box: the mysterious crime that shocked Germany – podcast    After class on Tuesday 15 September 1981, the first day of the new school year, a 10-year-old girl named Ursula Herrmann returned to her house in Eching. Ursula, the youngest of four siblings, practised piano with her oldest brother Michael, and then headed off to her late afternoon gymnastics lesson in Schondorf, cycling through the forest along the lakeside path. When the gym class was over, she went to her cousin’s house in Schondorf, where she ate dinner. At 7.20pm, Ursula’s mother phoned the aunt to say her daughter needed to come home. The shadows were lengthening but it was still light, and the cycle ride would only take 10 minutes. Half an hour later, she was still not home. Her mother again called the aunt, who said Ursula had left 25 minutes before. Both of them immediately knew something was wrong. Ursula’s father rushed into the forest from Eching, and her uncle did the same from Schondorf. They met in the middle, along the path. Ursula’s name rang out through the darkening wood. But there was no reply. Within an hour neighbours, police and firemen had joined the search, torch beams raking the water and struggling to penetrate the thick undergrowth. With midnight approaching, and rain falling, a sniffer dog led its handler away from the lake, into the brush. There, 20 metres from the path, was Ursula’s little red bike. But she was nowhere to be seen.     Ursula Herrmann, aged 10.  Photograph: Lka Bayern/EPA    At first light the search intensified. Dozens of officers wearing raincoats and rubber boots spread out through the dense forest, on the border of which stands Landheim Schondorf, an expensive private school founded in 1905 and favoured by Bavaria’s political and business elite. As a helicopter hovered overhead, a police boat and divers scanned the shallows of the lake. Local radio carried the shocking news of the missing girl in an idyllic part of the country: 1.43m (4ft 7in) tall with short blonde hair, wearing dark green cords, a grey woollen cardigan and red-brown sandals; the daughter of a teacher and a housewife. On the Thursday morning, when Ursula had been missing for more than 36 hours, the phone rang in the Herrmann house. When Ursula’s parents picked up there was silence, and then a short, familiar jingle, which they recognised from the traffic bulletin on the Bayern 3 radio station. More silence ensued, and then the jingle played again before the caller hung up. Three more similar calls – baffling and sinister – followed over a period of hours. A team from the local police department, now stationed inside the Herrmann home, began recording the calls. At noon the next day, the postman delivered an envelope addressed to Ursula’s father, marked urgent. Inside was a ransom note composed using letters and words cut out from tabloid newspapers. “We kidnapped your daughter,” the note began, in broken German. “If you ever want to see your daughter alive again, then pay 2m deutschmarks [£450,000] ransom.” The kidnappers, expecting the letter to have arrived a day earlier – before the calls began – explained that they would phone the Herrmanns using a jingle as their call sign. “Just say if you will pay or not pay … if you call the police or do not pay we will kill your daughter.” When the phone rang that afternoon, and the jingle sounded, Ursula’s mother agreed to pay the ransom. She also asked for proof of life: what were her daughter’s nicknames for her two stuffed toys? When the kidnappers did not reply, she became frantic. “Talk to me, say something, something from Ursula!” That same evening, the kidnappers posted a second letter, which arrived on Monday 21 September, with curiously specific instructions regarding the ransom. The kidnappers wanted the money to be paid in used 100-deutschmark bills, packed in a suitcase. It was to be delivered to an as yet unnamed location by Ursula’s father, who was to drive alone in a yellow Fiat 600 going no faster than 90km/h.     One of letters sent by the kidnappers, composed of newspaper cuttings. Photograph: EPA    Unlike some other residents of Eching, and the parents of the pupils at the boarding school in Schondorf, the Herrmanns were not wealthy. They had only been able to build a home near the lake because Ursula’s great-grandfather had purchased some grazing land there decades earlier. A neighbour raised part of the ransom, and the state agreed to cover the rest. The Herrmanns waited desperately for more instructions. But there were no more letters and no more calls. Nor did the police have any strong leads. Two weeks passed. The police decided to search the forest again. More than a hundred officers were assembled, with 10 sniffer dogs. The wood was divided into four parts, and each quarter into small grids. The teams began searching every grid, one by one, using metal rods to probe the ground. By the fourth day of searching, a gloomy Sunday, they had covered most of the forest. Ursula had been missing for 19 days. At 9.30am, there was a loud shout. In a tiny glade about 800m away from the lake path, one of the officers had struck something solid when probing the soil. Another policeman rushed over and, after wiping away the leaves and scraping through a layer of clay, discovered a brown blanket covering a wooden board. He removed it only to find second board, which appeared to be the lid of a box. It was 72cm by 60cm – the size of a small coffee table – painted green and locked from the top with seven sliding bolts. Using a spade, he forced the lid open, and peered in. There was Ursula. Her body was cold, lifeless. The officer wept when lifting her out. * * * Two detectives were sent to break the news to Ursula’s parents at their home, a short walk away. While her mother was too distraught to ask any questions, her father asked repeatedly: had his daughter been hurt before her death? The truthful answer was no. An autopsy concluded that Ursula died within 30 minutes to five hours of being buried. Since there was no sign of struggle, or even movement, inside the box, the doctors assumed she had been drugged beforehand, possibly with nitrous oxide. It appeared that the kidnappers had planned to keep Ursula alive. The box, 1.40m deep, was fitted with a shelf and a seat that doubled as a toilet. It was stocked with three bottles of water, 12 cans of Fanta, six large chocolate bars, four packets of biscuits and two packs of chewing gum. It also contained a small, bizarre library of 21 books, from Donald Duck comics to westerns, romance novels and thrillers with titles such as The Horror Lurks Everywhere. There was a light and a portable radio tuned to Bayern 3, the same station that broadcast the traffic jingle. To enable Ursula to breathe, the box had a ventilation system made from plastic plumbing pipes, which extended to ground level. But whoever designed it had failed to realise that without a machine to circulate the air, the oxygen would quickly run out. The police believed they were hunting more than one kidnapper, because of the size and weight of the box. At 60kg, it would probably have needed at least two people to carry it into the woods. The perpetrators must have known the forest well, for they had chosen a remote site within it, and had avoided attention while digging the hole and hacking paths through the dense brush. In Eching and nearby villages, parents who previously let their children roam free were now terrified to let them out of sight. The shock was amplified by the frenzied press coverage. On the day of the funeral, after much harassment from journalists, Ursula’s brother Michael, a shy 18-year-old, lost his temper with a photographer who held a camera right in front of his face, and knocked the camera to the ground. Desperate to find the culprits, the police offered a DM30,000 reward for information, and tips poured in. One name that came up was Werner Mazurek. He was 31, lived with his wife and their two children just a few hundred metres from the Herrmanns. A trained car mechanic who left school at 15 and now ran his own TV repair business, Mazurek was good with his hands. He was imposing – tall, with a beer-drinker’s stomach – and quick-tempered, and not well liked in Eching. He was also heavily in debt, owing a bank more than DM140,000, so he had a motive.     A police sketch of the box in which Ursula’s body was found Photograph: HAND OUT    Questioned by police a week after Ursula’s body was found, Mazurek could not initially recall his movements on the night she went missing. It took him 24 hours to provide an alibi: he had been playing the board game Risk with his wife and two friends. But a search of his home and workshop revealed nothing that linked him to the crime. Later that month, the forensics team examining the box found a fingerprint on a piece of duct tape, raising hopes of a breakthrough. Thousands of locals, including Mazurek, were fingerprinted, but no match was discovered. The police still suspected that Mazurek was involved. At the end of January 1982, they arrested him, along with two of his friends, and interrogated them for several days before releasing them. A month later, another of Mazurek’s acquaintances was questioned. Klaus Pfaffinger was an unemployed mechanic with a drinking problem. His landlord, who was owed rent, had told police that in the weeks before the crime he had seen his tenant driving his moped with a spade strapped to the side. Pfaffinger initially protested his innocence. But on the second day of questioning, when the interrogators took a break and he was alone with the police secretary, he said a startling thing: “What if I know something?” When the interrogators returned, Pfaffinger told them that Mazurek had asked him to dig a hole in the forest in early September 1981, promising payment of DM1,000 and a colour television. Pfaffinger said he had dug the hole and had later seen a box embedded inside. Convinced they had cracked the case, the detectives drove Pfaffinger to the forest that separated Eching and Schondorf. They asked him to lead them to the burial site. To their dismay, he was unable to locate it, or even come close. On returning to the police station, he announced: “I am revoking this confession, it’s not true what I said.” During at least 10 subsequent interrogations in the following months, he refused to repeat his confession, and was eventually released without charge. By the summer of 1982, after his name was smeared, Mazurek was preparing to move away from Eching with his family. The lead detective who had pursued him was replaced, and the net cast more widely. Some 100,000 colour posters requesting help with the investigation were distributed nationwide. A television programme, Aktenzeichen XY ... Ungelöst – Case number XY … Unsolved – which would serve as the model for the BBC’s Crimewatch and America’s Most Wanted, featured a long segment on the Ursula Herrmann case. The new police team found more evidence of the kidnappers’ methods, including a wire that they had strung through the trees along the lakeside path to serve as an alert system during the abduction. But investigations of other suspects came to nothing. By the end of the 1980s, the investigation had wound down. Across Germany, most people still remembered the shocking unsolved case of the 10-year-old girl buried alive in the box. Ursula’s parents and siblings, meanwhile, were doing their best to move on with their lives. Though they grieved deeply for Ursula, who they remembered as an intelligent, energetic girl who loved to sing and paint, they did so in private, never speaking to the press. Soon after their youngest child’s death, the parents had made a conscious decision not to let the hunt for the kidnappers consume the family, or the tragedy define their lives. Without any known perpetrators to blame, they tried to think of it as a terrible accident. It was hardest for Ursula’s mother, who believed she should have gone to fetch her daughter from her cousin’s house. Ursula’s father and sister turned to their strong Christian faith to find peace. Her youngest brother eventually found solace in surfing.     A model of the box on display at the district court in Augsburg. Photograph: Karl-Josef Hildebrand/EPA/Shutterstock    Michael, the elder brother, who was in his final year of school at the time of the crime, was playing music at a friend’s house on the night Ursula disappeared. When his mother called in a panic, saying his little sister was missing, he rushed home and joined the search for her in the forest. He was devastated when her body was found. “Then it quickly turned into: what can I do with this now?” he told me recently. “Because I knew the ‘why’ could never be answered. I decided: I am alive and I have some tasks to do.” * * * In the mid-2000s, the Bavarian state office for criminal investigations started looking in earnest at its backlog of cold cases. The most famous was the Ursula Herrmann kidnapping, which had by then appeared three times on Case number XY … Unsolved, and was still a stain on the reputation of the local police and judiciary. Prosecutors hoped that the development of DNA profiling over the previous two decades might help crack the case. The mass of evidence from the original investigation, including the ransom notes and the box, was painstakingly re-examined. Numerous hairs were found, from which the forensic experts were able to build the DNA profiles of several different people. Now they just needed a match. In 2007 they got one. A genetic sample recovered from a screw on the box matched that found on a glass in the Munich penthouse of a wealthy woman who was brutally murdered there in May 2006. But the police excitement about a breakthrough was short-lived. On trial for the Munich killing was the victim’s nephew, who was only a few years old when Ursula was kidnapped. After extensive forensic investigations, the judges ruled that no link could be established between the two criminal cases, and the nephew was convicted for the Munich murder. How the match with the sample from the Herrmann case occurred remains a mystery – though very rare, mistakes do occur in genetic profiling. For the prosecutors looking at the Herrmann case, time was running out. Her death had not been deemed a murder, but rather kidnapping with deadly consequences, a crime that carried a 30-year statute of limitations. In five years, the people responsible would be in the clear. The state prosecutors went back to the 1980s case files, to look at the main suspects. Klaus Pfaffinger, the unemployed man who briefly claimed to have dug the hole, was dead. But Werner Mazurek was still alive, and living with his wife in the north of Germany, where he ran a boat accessories businesses and, with a friend on Tuesday evenings, a snack bar that bore the advertising slogan: “Norbert’s pig and Werner’s beer, the finest at the harbour pier”. In 2007, Mazurek was placed under surveillance and an undercover officer deployed to befriend him. Police planted recording devices in his car and his house, and tapped his phone. In October that year, his home was searched and he was asked to provide a saliva sample. It did not match any of the genetic profiles found on the box.     Ursula’s brother Michael at the court during the murder trial in 2009. Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance Archive/Alamy    The prosecutors had one hope left. Among the items taken from Mazurek’s house during the search was an old reel-to-reel tape recorder. In the calls to Ursula’s parents in the days after her disappearance, the kidnappers had played a jingle. Was it possible that this device was used to record that jingle from the radio all those years ago? A sound expert, who had access to the original recordings of the 1981 calls, spent months conducting tests on the tape recorder, concluding that it was indeed used in the kidnapping. On 28 May 2008, nearly 27 years after Ursula’s death, Mazurek was arrested and flown to Augsburg, a city near Eching. Ursula’s parents, who were still living in the same house by the Ammersee, had been notified a few days before that an arrest was imminent. They were also told they could be part of the trial. Under the German legal system, relatives of the victims of certain serious crimes are allowed to formally join the prosecution as nebenklage, or co-plaintiffs. This gives them the right to view the evidence, request witnesses and put questions to the judges. Ursula’s parents did not want to be confronted again by the horrifying details of their daughter’s death, all these years later. Instead, it was agreed that the co-plaintiff would be their oldest son, Michael, who was by then in his 40s, teaching religion and music at a girls’ secondary school in Augsburg. He was a quiet, family man, but also one who is “not content with half-truths”, as his old friend Michael Hofstetter, who was with him in Eching on the evening Ursula disappeared, recently told the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. “He has such a very deep sense of justice that drives him.” * * * The trial opened in February 2009 before a packed court in Augsburg. Mazurek, characterised in one newspaper as a “bearded giant”, sat in front of his wife, who was also on trial as an accessory to the crime. Reading from a 20-page statement, Mazurek insisted he was innocent. “I know I was certainly not a good citizen, sometimes rude, and we’ll see many attempts to portray me as a bad person. But I have nothing to do with this act.” The prosecution had no difficulty finding evidence of his poor character. Mazurek’s daughter and stepson had few good things to say about him as a father. He had also had other scrapes with the law, including a fraud conviction in 2004 for falsifying documents. Then there was the story about the dog. In 1974, Mazurek returned from the Oktoberfest beer festival to find that the family dog, a mixed-breed named Susi, had overturned the rubbish bin in the kitchen. Mazurek grabbed the dog and locked it in the basement freezer. The next day his wife at the time, who would soon divorce him, went to the freezer to get some meat only to discover Susi there, frozen to death. Mazurek later said he had punished the pet “with exile to Siberia”. The prosecution laid out the circumstantial evidence against Mazurek. He had a motive as he needed the money, and the means to secretly build a box, because he owned a workshop. While Ursula was missing he had been observed listening to police radio, and a piece of leather used in the box construction was cut from a belt owned by someone with a large stomach, like Mazurek. And, in 2007, after police searched and bugged his house, they listened in on a phone call between him and an old friend from Eching where they discussed the statute of limitations for the Ursula Herrmann case. But the key elements of the prosecutors’ case were the revoked confession by Pfaffinger – that he dug the hole at Mazurek’s request – and the tape recorder. They insisted the confession was credible. As the old police files showed, Pfaffinger’s confession was accurate in several ways: he had described the burial site in detail, from the size of the forest glade and the dimensions of the hole to the soil conditions. The lead police investigator in 1982 was convinced Pfaffinger deliberately misled him during the forest visit, when he could not locate where the box was buried. Testifying in court, all these years later, the same policeman described Pfaffinger as an “excellent actor and practised swindler”. The tape recorder was the most important, and controversial, piece of evidence. When questioned by police in 2007, Mazurek said he had purchased it only a few weeks earlier, at a flea market while on a short holiday with his wife. But he could not prove who sold it to him, and nobody at the market could recall such a device being on sale that day. The state’s expert, whose speciality was phonetics rather than audio, described how, in the recording of the ransom calls, you could hear a couple of clicking sounds – the buttons of a tape recorder being pressed during the recording of the jingle. When she pressed the buttons on the tape machine, she had, in her words, an “aha” moment. The sounds were identical. Other subtle characteristics of the recording also corresponded precisely to the specific machine in front of her. It was, she said, “probable” that the very same tape recorder found in Mazurek’s house was used in the ransom calls.     Detective chief superintendent Detlef Puchelt shows a picture of the tape recorder that was used as evidence. Photograph: Christof Stache/AP    Summing up, in March 2010, the senior prosecutor reminded the court that Ursula had been “buried alive in a box”, revealing the “cold-bloodedness and mercilessness of the perpetrator”. The three judges and two jurors were convinced, finding Mazurek guilty and sentencing him to life imprisonment. His wife was acquitted, due to lack of evidence. In court, everyone seemed happy that Ursula’s killer had finally been put away. Everyone, that is, except one person. * * * At the start of the trial, few people in court had taken much notice of Michael Herrmann. Despite his distinctive appearance – he wears his grey hair in a ponytail and at the time also sported thin sideburns down to his jaw – he is unassuming, not the kind of man who draws attention to himself. After graduating from high school, he studied teaching in Augsburg, and then opened a music store, selling instruments and equipment, including tape recorders. He got married, had three children and fostered a fourth. He loved watching them grow up, seeing them share his love of music, finding their own way in life. People who knew what happened to Ursula sometimes asked if it made Michael anxious about his own kids, but for some reason it didn’t. Nor did he ever think about looking for the perpetrators himself; that was the job of the police. Though he felt at peace in his life, his sister’s death still felt to him like an “unclosed circle”. The trial, and his status as a co-plaintiff, offered an opportunity to close it. While most nebenklage are passive observers in court, Michael decided to take his role far more seriously. He would not allow the family to be victims a second time. Before the trial started, to the surprise of his state-assigned lawyer, Michael had requested full access to the case files, which ran into tens of thousands of scanned pages. In the first few weeks of the trial he got through 6,000 pages, locking himself in the study at home at night, unable to stop reading. His memories of Ursula were strong: he recalled how, despite her liveliness, she was also cautious and at times sensitive, growing upset when some of her schoolmates repeatedly misbehaved. But reading through the typewritten police reports he realised he had forgotten many of the details of the horrifying days in September 1981, even the fact that he had helped Ursula with her piano practice just a few hours before she was kidnapped. It was, he felt, like his brain has somehow blanked out that part of his life. To Michael, there was much to suggest Mazurek might have committed the crime, but there were also things that troubled him about the prosecution case. He could not understand why Pfaffinger’s revoked confession was now being treated as plausible, when it was dismissed all those years before. From the police files it was clear that Pfaffinger had a serious alcohol problem. While in detention he claimed to have experienced hallucinations. He was also chronically work-shy; questioned in 2008, his former wife called him a “lazy guy” who would never have agreed to dig a large hole. As the court heard, Pfaffinger’s confession was not even signed; the investigator wrote it down from memory weeks later. And, as with Mazurek, there was no DNA proof connecting Pfaffinger to the crime. Before the trial, the police exhumed Pfaffinger’s body but there was no match to the genetic profiles they had discovered among the evidence a few years before. Most concerning to Michael was the tape recorder. With his background in music, he knew a lot about acoustics and sound engineering, and could not understand how a tape recorder could be definitively linked to the ransom calls all those years ago. Even if the reel-to-reel device had been used to record the jingle from the radio, as the prosecution alleged, the kidnappers would still have had to transfer that recording to a second, more portable device, since the calls to the Herrmann house were made from pay phones. The acoustic environments in the booth and at the kidnapper’s home would also have influenced what the police eventually heard and recorded at the other end of the phone line. Michael’s lawyer advised him not to make a big deal out of it. “She said: ‘you don’t do this as a nebenklage’. But I did not think about habits, I just did what I thought was right,” Michael told me. He wrote a letter to the court, calling the sound expert’s report about the tape recorder “incomplete or one-sided”. The judges were not happy, but by law they were obliged to read out the letter in court. It was a highly unusual and sensational intervention – a member of the prosecution team, the victim’s brother, no less, acting in favour of the defence. When the verdict against Mazurek was announced, Michael made a statement at the courthouse. “I am not convinced of his guilt,” he said. “But neither am I convinced of his innocence.” Instead of the circle being closed, it had opened further. * * * Six months after the trial, in late 2010, Michael began to notice a strange, high frequency noise in his left ear. At night the hissing would wake him up and prevent him falling back asleep. Even worse, it often tormented him during the day, especially when was he trying to teach music. He had never experienced tinnitus before, and thought it might relate to the trial. The court-appointed psychologist, on hand to assist relatives of crime victims, examined him and agreed that the stress of the court case was indeed the likely cause. During the trial, Mazurek had sent Michael a letter – not to thank him for questioning the tape recorder evidence but to suggest that they were somehow on the same side. From prison Mazurek kept writing, and even sent a Christmas card. In 2013, Michael finally replied. “I was surprised to receive a letter from you, because it is certainly clear to you that despite all the doubts I have about your guilt, I have considerable reservations about your person,” he wrote. “If you are not the culprit I wish [for] more new insights and that you can be rehabilitated. If you are the culprit, go to hell.” By then, Michael was increasingly sceptical that Mazurek was guilty. After the trial ended, Michael kept returning, night after night, his ear ringing, to the case files, which he had stored on his computer, meticulously arranging the evidence in folders. It had put strain on his marriage – he separated from his wife in 2012 – but he could not let it go. He felt he owed it to his parents, to himself, even to the German public, to pursue the truth. “What drives me is ethics – doing what is morally right,” he told me. “It was just wrong for the case to end like it did.”     Werner Mazurek in court Photograph: Christof Stache/APN    So he came up with a plan. In 2013, he filed a civil claim, seeking €20,000 in damages from Mazurek for causing his tinnitus. It was a legal ruse: since Mazurek would defend the case on the basis that he was wrongfully convicted and so could not be considered responsible, the court would have to reconsider the facts of the criminal trial before coming to a conclusion. It would be an opportunity, Michael believed, “to get nearer to the truth”. “The judges knew what was going on, and they were pissed off,” Joachim Feller, who has been Michael’s lawyer since 2012, told me when we met at his offices in Landsberg am Lech, an ancient town about 20 minutes drive from Eching. “They tried several times to stop it going forward.” The court insisted that an independent psychiatrist examine Michael, and to rule on whether his tinnitus was caused by the trial. After the psychiatrist confirmed it was, the case finally went ahead in 2016. It dragged on for more than two years. Unlike with the criminal trial, where the media focus was on Mazurek, it was now on Michael. He found himself having to explain to his pupils in his music and religion classes, who knew him as a reserved, kind teacher, why they were seeing his face in the newspapers and on TV. He took journalists to Eching, and into the forest where Ursula was kidnapped. Even so, apart from Herrmann’s close family and friends, few understood why he was pursuing the case. A local journalist who covered the criminal and civil cases told me his newsroom colleagues often asked him why Herrmann “could not just let it go”. “I myself am still trying to work out why Michael Herrmann is acting like this,” the journalist said. “He is quiet and calm, but still he looks into the files … There is a little obsession.” As the civil trial went on, it became clear that he was not the only person with doubts about the original verdict. Appearing for the defence was a retired physicist and amateur sound expert named Bernd Haider, who had built his first tape recorder from scratch in the 1960s and lived in a village just a few miles from Eching. He vividly remembered the coverage of the crime from 1981, though he had never heard of Mazurek before his arrest. Haider had followed the 2009 trial in the media and, like Michael, was highly sceptical about the tape-recorder evidence. Later, he had borrowed a similar machine, got hold of the ransom call recordings, and tried to see if it was possible to replicate the phonetic expert’s findings. After a year of testing, he concluded it was not, and offered his assistance to Mazurek’s lawyer. When I visited Haider this spring, the borrowed tape recorder was still in his loft. After a lunch of wiener schnitzel and potatoes, he told me: “Michael Herrmann was the only person in the original trial who understood what the problem with this evidence was. He said ‘it’s impossible’, but he was sitting on the wrong side of the court!” Towards the end of the civil case, Michael gained another ally. In London, a German academic named Barbara Zipser read an article online about his efforts to get to the truth. Zipser was a child in Germany when Ursula was kidnapped, and recalled the horror she felt then. In terms of its impact, it was the German equivalent of the Madeleine McCann case, Zipser told me when we met this year. “I thought: whoever did this, I want that person in jail,” she said. Since Zipser’s speciality is linguistic profiling – at Royal Holloway, University of London, she uses modern profiling techniques to identify authors of ancient Greek medical texts – she decided to compare the ransom notes sent by the kidnappers to samples of Mazurek’s writing, which Haider had posted on the internet. Zipser analysed the words used, and the writing style. Whoever composed the ransom notes was well educated, she said, a native speaker pretending to be a foreigner by writing in broken German. “I am sure it was not Mazurek,” Zipser told me. Her opinion only hardened after she went to meet Michael in Germany, and spent many hours going through the case files with him. “I know this is an incredible story but I’ve seen the evidence, and Michael has done very good investigative work,” she said. “I support him in his findings.” For a few years after the criminal trial Michael thought there was still a 50% chance that Mazurek was the kidnapper. Now he puts it at 1%. In August 2018, the civil case concluded and the court ordered Mazurek to pay Michael €7,000 for causing his tinnitus. It was a victory that to Michael represented a loss, since to arrive at the decision the judges first needed to agree with the criminal court that Mazurek, together with an unidentified accomplice, was indeed the man who had kidnapped Ursula. In an open letter to the Bavarian state and the media, Michael wrote: “My sister’s fate has stayed with me for 37 years, and to this day, it is unclear who was actually responsible for her death. Could it be that the Augsburg legal system is not actually interested in solving the case of Ursula Herrmann, the death of my little sister? … If the court decides to close the proverbial lid, it should be well aware that one cannot shut the truth away.” * * * Since Mazurek was arrested in 2008, he has been represented by Walter Rubach, one of Bavaria’s best-known defence lawyers. Rubach sees things in black and white. If a client asks him whether he believes in their innocence – as Mazurek did in 2008 – he brushes away the question. “I told him I don’t believe any of my clients,” Rubach told me in his chambers in Augsburg. “My job is to work out if there’s enough proof and evidence to convict them.” In Mazurek’s case he was convinced from the start that there wasn’t. “It was clear that Mazurek was a person who could have committed something like that. But there were no hard facts – it was a circumstantial case at its finest,” Rubach said. “I am still upset at how he was convicted. What is it you say in England? Rather let 10 guilty men go free than hang one innocent one.” Though Rubach has had little personal interaction with Michael, he has watched him across the court, and likes and admires him. “What he has done, as a co-plaintiff, going against the decision of a court – this never happened before in Germany.” From his prison cell in Germany’s far north, Mazurek is still trying to clear his name. After I wrote to him this year, he replied saying he had hired a private investigator to track down the man who he says sold him the tape recorder in 2007. “I am just angry and I am awaiting the 11th anniversary of my time in jail,” he wrote. On a mild Sunday morning in April, I met Michael in Augsburg. As he had been most days in court, he was dressed casually, in trainers, blue jeans and a black jacket. Despite his legal setbacks, and the tinnitus that continues to bother him, he comes across as calm and warm, and possesses a dry sense of humour. As we drove through the Bavarian countryside towards Eching, he tried to explain the meaning of überfordert, the word he used to describe the police in 1981: “It means when the task you have is bigger than your capabilities – like Brexit.” Michael knows the case material so well – he has put in far more hours of research than any of the lawyers for the defence or prosecution – that when he speaks, it is with the precision and detachment of a special investigator, rather than a relative. After parking the car beside the road between Eching and Schondorf, he noted it was probably where the kidnappers had parked when bringing the box to the forest. An SUV track led into the woods. “We need to walk 141 metres,” Michael said, and then look 20 metres to the left, to locate the spot where Ursula was buried. “We don’t know if she was sedated and carried or if she was forced to walk there,” he said. “But we know she was taken on paths specially cut through the forest.” Michael’s father died several years ago, and in 2016 his mother moved out of the family home in the village to Augsburg. But his younger brother Hannes – the surfer – still lives in the house, along with two Syrian refugees who rent out the bottom floor. Michael phoned him – he did not want to show up with a journalist, unannounced – and Hannes invited us in for coffee. We never spoke about Ursula. As with his oldest sister and their mother, Hannes has never talked to the media about his sister’s death, though Michael says that in private his family supports his work on the case, as do his children and his new partner. But in public, at least, he is alone in his quest to reopen the case. After lunch at a restaurant beside the lake, where sailboats bobbed in the distance, we walked along the road towards the forest, the route Ursula took on her way to gym class nearly 40 years ago. The spruce trees are much taller than they were then, and the undergrowth less thick, but the path is the same: three metres wide, compact gravel. Cyclists on electric bikes sped by. After a few minutes, as we neared a small jetty leading to a wooden hut used by bathers, Michael stopped on the path. “This is where Ursula was kidnapped,” he said. “It’s where her bike was found and where the bell-wire ended.” The bell-wire is the 140m-long coil of insulated copper wire the kidnappers used as part of a warning system. Though the police had noticed the wire while searching for Ursula, they only learned of its significance more than a year later, when investigators visited the private boarding school in Schondorf to talk to pupils about the case. Two students came forward, saying that seven or eight months after the kidnapping, when chasing an owl through the forest, they had found the bell-wire strung through the trees next to the lakeside path. The boys then did a very strange thing: they took the wire down, measured it on the school athletics track, and then kept it in their dormitory in a locked box, until the police visit. On examining the wire, the investigators realised it must have been used during Ursula’s abduction. While one of the kidnappers waited for the victim, the other presumably served as a lookout further along the path, with their finger on a button that would light up a bulb or sound a buzzer at the other end of the wire. Michael believes the wire is one of the key pieces of evidence that could help identify the real kidnappers. Besides hunters, joggers and cyclists, the boarding school pupils also knew the forest well. Yet it appears that none of them were fingerprinted at the time of the investigation. Another piece of evidence also hints at the possible involvement of younger people in the plot: an impression on the paper of one of the ransom notes revealed a mathematical probability tree, of the sort taught to teenagers. Michael also notes that in a comic found in the box, one of the main characters drives a Fiat 600, the car that was mentioned in the ransom note and which was rare in Germany at the time, suggesting the kidnappers may have read the comic. Late last year, in an effort to have the case reopened, Michael submitted a dossier of all his new evidence and theories to the state prosecutor’s office in Augsburg. In April, when I interviewed Matthias Nickolai, spokesman for the public prosecutor, he acknowledged that many people still had questions about the verdict in the criminal trial, but insisted the judges had arrived at the correct decision in 2010, and that it was “final and absolute”. In August, this became official, when the prosecutor’s office announced it would not be reopening the case. Through his lawyer, Michael told the local press that he would be making no more public statements about the case, nor giving interviews, which the media interpreted as him finally giving up. But when I emailed him recently he said this was not true. “I didn’t say that I am not going to take it any further,” he wrote. On 15 September, a few days after I received that message, it was the 38th anniversary of Ursula’s kidnapping and death. As they have done for the last few years, Michael, along with his two siblings and his mother, travelled to the graveyard in Eching where Ursula is buried. Just the four of them, no partners. There they remembered the little girl who left her cousin’s house on her red bike on a summer’s evening and never came home. •"
91,crime,The new approach keeping looked-after children out of crime in North Yorkshire,"On the face of it, 15-year-old Matty is not like many children in care in North Yorkshire. He has a part-time job, goes to college, and plans to study A-levels. But a few weeks ago he was kicked out of his family home after being arrested for possession of a knife. 
The teenager, who had never previously been in trouble with the police, was taken into care and placed temporarily with a family friend until he can be found somewhere permanent to live. Care workers also want to steer him away from a troublesome group of friends. 
“He is on the edge,” said Jezz Pratt, a former police officer turned children’s worker. “The next two to three months are going to be crucial for him. He’s one of those where you could see him in five or six years and he’s happy with a house and a job.” Or, he adds, Matty could be yet another looked-after child who ends up homeless or involved in serious criminality. 
Matty is one of 66 children in care in North Yorkshire who are part of a pioneering scheme that aims to stop the “systemic problem” of the criminalisation of looked-after children. Those living in care are 15 times more likely to be criminalised than other children, according to research by the Howard League for Penal Reform. Often, looked-after children are prosecuted over minor incidents that would never warrant police action if they happened in family homes. 
 
  
  
   
    
    Children in the dock is an investigation into the youth justice system in England and Wales, which in 2018 saw 26,881 children aged 10-17 cautioned or convicted of crimes ranging from shoplifting and joyriding to rape and robbery.
    No other EU country puts such young children on trial. Most other nations do not use an adversarial system which can see children separated from their parents and lawyers via bulletproof glass in what is essentially an adult courtroom with a different sign on the door.
    Officially, the focus in youth courts is on rehabilitation, tackling the underlying causes of youth offending. But although there has been an 88% drop in the number of children cautioned or convicted since 2007, reoffending rates have increased. Just over 40% of children who go to court reoffend within a year; for those sent to youth custody, that figure rises to 71.6%.
    Children who end up in trouble now are disproportionately likely to be of black, Asian or minority ethnicity. They are vastly more likely to be in care and they are extremely likely to have ADHD, autism spectrum disorders and communication difficulties. This series examines how the court system deals with these vulnerable children and explores whether there is a better way to break the cycle of offending and help them build productive and fulfilling lives.
    
   
  
  
 
The North Yorkshire initiative, called No Wrong Door, is based on a dedicated team of specialists including a police officer, a clinical psychologist and a speech and language therapist who are based at each of the region’s two council-run children’s homes, in Scarborough and Harrogate. There are no uniforms, no suits and no appointments – the professionals have a mentor-like relationship with the children based on informal chats over breakfast, in the car, or at the gym. 
And the scheme is having impressive results: an independent report by Loughborough University found a 38% drop in arrests, a 68% reduction in children going missing, a 33% fall in drug use, and hospital admissions reduced by 92% in its first 18 months from 2015 to 2017. 
The programme is being rolled out to six other children’s services and has attracted interest from more than 100 councils across Britain, as well as further afield in Australia, the US and the Caribbean. It has won praise from Ofsted, the chief social worker for England, Isabelle Trowler, and Sir Martin Narey, the former director general of prisons. 
The key to its success is having a specialist team all under one roof. “Kids fall out of bed and they need to speak to Ian [the clinical psychologist], they knock on his door,” said Cerena Butterworth, the team manager at the Scarborough home. Each child has a dedicated support worker, who is their consistent point of contact, while the police, council, psychologist and speech therapist – who ordinarily would have little contact with each other – work closely in the interests of the child. 
Although a police officer is based at the children’s home every day, there are no handcuffs or helmets. “If uniform turns up here, the kids are in crisis because what’s the background for the kid? They see a very negative view of the police because it’s the police turning up arresting mum or dad,” said Neil Millican, the resident police officer, dressed casually in jeans and shirt. “They go into fight or flight mode and they just fight. Then we’re having to arrest them for assault and they are in that cycle.” 
Kirsty Basnett, the speech and language therapist, found that 51% of North Yorkshire’s looked-after children (and as many as two-thirds of those in residential care) had previously undiagnosed speech and language communication needs (SLCN), such as stammering and lack of eye contact, as well as wider problems with understanding language. 
One girl with a previously undiagnosed SLCN was being arrested on a daily basis for breaching bail conditions that prohibited her from visiting a particular street in Scarborough. She would become angry at being arrested, leading to further arrests. Only when she was diagnosed did professionals realise that she simply could not understand the terms of her bail condition. They took her to the street to explain where she was not allowed to go and overnight she stopped offending. 
“These kids would never normally be seen by someone like me,” said Basnett. “These are kids that are often forgotten about. People see the behaviour but don’t connect that with the communication difficulty – that’s why we need to be embedded [in children’s homes], otherwise it’s just lip service.” 
“It comes down to: would it be good enough for my child?” said James Cliffe, who runs the Scarborough home, where Halloween decorations are dotted around a CS Lewis quote on the dining room wall: “You can’t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending.” On Matty, Cliffe said the coming weeks would be crucial, but he was optimistic: “I am very hopeful for him.”"
92,crime,Weatherwatch: a heatwave can lead to a crime wave,"You might expect tempers to boil over and violence to spike in a heatwave. You might also expect heat to make people lethargic and less likely to exert themselves. Crime statistics show that both effects are real. In Britain, we spend more time outside in summer, and the whole pattern of crime changes, so it is not just a matter of warmth. However, statistical studies in many countries, comparing warmer years with cooler ones, strongly suggest that temperature affects violence. A study in New South Wales found that the number of cases of assault each day rose as it got hotter, but dropped when the temperatures passed 30C. Non-violent crimes, such as fraud, did not increase the same way. Researchers in Korea found a direct association between temperature and assault, while in Finland violent crime appears to rise by about 2% per degree temperature increase. In Chicago, an analysis of 5m police reports since 2001 shows a steady increase of crime rate with temperatures up to 32C, but falling off after that. The reasons behind these effects have not been fully studied, but the intuitive explanation may be the best one. High temperatures make people more impulsive, and violent acts get committed literally in the heat of the moment."
93,crime,"In Greater Manchester, youth crime is up but fewer go to court. Why?","Despite a 75% drop in the number of children going through the courts in England and Wales since 2010, in many areas more children than ever are being accused of crimes, according to figures obtained by the Guardian. 
In Greater Manchester, for example, figures released to the Guardian under freedom of information (FOI) laws show that children aged 10 to 17 were suspected of 24,250 crimes from March 2018 to March 2019, compared with 14,429 in 2012-13 – an increase of 40%. 
During that time, the number of youths charged almost halved, going from 3,231 in 2012-13 to 1,742 in 2018-19, a drop of 46%. 
The difference is how they are now being dealt with. The Youth Justice Board says fewer children are being cautioned or convicted because there has been a big push towards out-of-court disposals such as restorative justice, which brings those harmed by crime or conflict and those responsible for the harm into communication.

But in Greater Manchester at least, restorative justice is being used less than ever. In 2018-19, 2,650 offences were dealt with using restorative justice, compared with 4,490 in 2012-13. 
What appears to have changed is how well (or badly) police gather evidence. In 2018-19, more than half of all cases involving children (14,044) did not proceed because although a suspect was identified, there was either “insufficient” evidence or “evidential difficulties”. In 2012-13, the figure was just 1,723. 
There has also been a big rise in detectives taking their time with cases and releasing children “under investigation” for months or even years without charge. Release under investigation (RUI) expanded hugely after April 2017 when a law change (the Bail Act) meant police could only bail people for an initial period of 28 days. 
As a result of decreasing police resources – Greater Manchester police (GMP) have lost 2,000 officers and 1,000 staff since 2010 after having their budget cut by £125m – it has become increasingly difficult to complete many investigations within a 28-day period and so forces use RUI instead. 
The practice has been criticised by the Law Society, which says RUI leaves the accused and victims in limbo with no updates on their case for an unlimited time. There is also evidence that people are being released under investigation who could be a risk to victims of crime and the public in general, rather than being put on bail as would be more appropriate. This particularly affects victims, who may be targeted again by the same perpetrator. 
Figures collected by the Law Society under FOI revealed that GMP released 9,579 people and bailed 1,846 in 2017-18 . A year earlier the force arrested and bailed 12,370 people. 
Where children are concerned, GMP failed to decide what to do with 1,256 youth cases in 2018-19, labelling them “decision pending”. These included one allegation of murder and 100 of rape. 
“Decision pending means that a case has been referred to a juvenile diversion panel or to the CPS and we are awaiting their decision,” GMP said. 
The force said the increase in youth crimes had resulted from changes to the way crime was reported. “In line with the Home Office crime recording standards, police services are recording crimes at incidents in 2018-19 which were not being recorded in the years 2012-13 and before,” a spokesman said. 
“These additional crimes have contributed to the increase in cases of evidential difficulty. By their nature, in the incidents where the commission of a crime is less clear, it will be more difficult to prove that an individual has acted unlawfully, which has a higher evidential threshold.” 
Charlie Taylor, the head of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales, said he was “really worried” about the abuse of RUI, which could be “completely unfair” to both child suspects and victims. 
 
  Callout callout-youth-courts ""> 
 
He said he had raised his concerns at a criminal justice board meeting this year attended by the justice secretary, the home secretary and the attorney general, telling them of a child accused of a sex offence who had been released under investigation for two years. As the investigation had dragged on without a conviction, the youth offending team had been unable to work with him and both the suspect and the complainant had been “left dangling for two years”, he said. 
“As a result of that conversation, both Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and the Crown Prosecution Service inspectorate are doing an investigation into it,” said Taylor. “There’s a consensus when it comes to RUI that it’s completely unfair. The police don’t particularly like it and it is just not proving effective, particularly for children, and it really worries me.” 
Olivia Pinkney, a chief constable and the national policing lead for children and young people, said RUI was bad for children. “Anything that runs even a month, let alone a year, is profound. Not only will they have grown up significantly in that period, but it can actually have a really material impact on education. You know, you miss a whole year of school, GCSEs, all of that stuff,” she said. 
“There are real practical implications of release under investigation. The Law Society are right. Policing has always said that we absolutely acknowledge the problem that the changes to the Bail Act were supposed to solve, but that the solution wasn’t the right one.” "
94,crime,I was charged with a crime and £135 costs after I forgot my railcard,"I have just read your article “Now you can forget your railcard once without being charged a fortune”. This came as some surprise as I have just been charged with a criminal offence for failing to carry a valid ticket and am facing prosecution. I had absent-mindedly left my young person’s railcard at home in June and was travelling on a discounted ticket bought from Govia Thameslink from Willesden Junction to Huntingdon. The full price was £30.20, but I paid £19.95. The ticket inspector gave me an email address and asked me to send through the railcard details which would be checked against their database. He did not ask me to pay the difference in ticket price or offer a penalty fare. This is the first time this has happened. Nevertheless I have received court documents asking me to submit a plea and saying that they will try to claim at least £135 of prosecution costs. A criminal record and £135 seems totally disproportionate given the discount I obtained was just over £10, and (as per your article) I was given to believe that the policy was different for forgotten railcards. DG, Huntingdon, Cambs Govia Thameslink says as a result of you sending proof of your valid railcard, “no further action will be taken. A letter has already been posted to him to confirm this.” Clearly, rail operators have to make sure passengers don’t fraudulently travel on cheaper fares, but operators should also give passengers the benefit of the doubt. The good news is rail companies offer digital versions of railcards that can be stored on a smartphone app. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

96,crime,Victorian government orders investigation into Crown casino crime allegations,"Victoria’s minister for gambling, Marlene Kairouz, says she has ordered the state’s casino regulator to conduct a snap investigation into a flood of allegations made against Crown Resorts and its Melbourne operation that include claims of links to organised crime and that its high rollers got waved through immigration without proper checks. Kairouz said her department would also review the regulation of junket operators who bring high rollers from China, some of whom have been linked by Nine to Triad gangs. The move follows the federal attorney general Christian Porter’s decision on Tuesday to refer allegations about the potential corruption of law enforcement officers to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. It also follows the revelation on Wednesday night that the powerful but secretive Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission is investigating casino junkets as part of an investigation that has been on foot since September 2013.   Related: Crown casino yet to fix money laundering risks and presence of alleged criminals, documents reveal    “The Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation will cooperate fully with any investigation,” Kairouz said. “I’ve asked the regulator to re-examine the allegations raised as a matter of priority and report back to me as soon as possible. “I’ve also asked the department, with the assistance of the commission, to examine the regulatory arrangements of junket operators.” She said anyone with information should come forward to authorities. Crown has been under siege since Saturday, when Nine began publishing reports in its newspapers and on its flagship television current affairs program 60 Minutes linking the casino company to triads and money laundering through its junkets. Nine has also claimed the Chinese president Xi Jinping’s cousin and the controversial businessman and political donor Huang Xiangmo were Crown high rollers, and alleged an Australian Border Force officer moonlighted for a Crown junket operator who is wanted by Interpol and operated an illegal hunting operation in country Victoria.  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning        On Tuesday, the independent MP Andrew Wilkie added fuel to the fire by using parliamentary privilege to air claims by a former driver for Crown that there were “no Border Force checks” when high rollers were brought into Australia on the casino’s private jets. Wilkie also detailed allegations of rampant illegal drug use and violence against women at the casino, telling parliament the whistleblower became numb to the sight of “women being degraded, women being abused, women slapped around”. On Thursday, the Guardian revealed that Crown had yet to satisfy the VCGLR it had complied with nine recommendations due to be in place a month ago that include beefing up anti-money laundering safeguards and doing more to keep criminals out of the Melbourne casino. “The Commission continues to undertake a thorough and rigorous assessment of the submissions made by Crown in respect to the recommendations and the outcomes will be reported back to government,” the VCGLR chief executive, Catherine Myers, said. The ACIC declined to comment on its work on casino junkets, which forms part of a broader special investigation named Targeting Criminal Wealth No.2. However, the Guardian has confirmed reports by Nine that the ACIC believes casino junkets present a significant risk of money laundering, partly because they operate as a shadow banking system, enabling money to move around the world and hide criminal wealth.   Related: Greens condemn Chinese high-rollers being offered wombat hunts    The ACIC also believes factors including the lack of transparency of junket operations and the anonymity of participants in them provide opportunities for criminal exploitation. It says the money laundering risk is made worse because the casino’s customers are the junket operators, rather than individual gamblers. This means that casinos are conducting important anti-money laundering “know your customer” checks not on gamblers but only on junket operators who may be difficult to fully profile because they are from overseas. Crown has consistently denied any wrongdoing and hit back on Thursday with full-page advertisements signed by its board slamming Nine’s coverage as “a deceitful campaign against Crown”. In a point-by-point response, Nine said its work was “carefully sourced” and Crown had refused to answer 63 questions put to it."
97,crime,Trump says he will not pardon Stone 'yet' as Barr agrees to testify over conduct – as it happened,"  1.24am GMT    Summary     The chair of the Iowa Democratic Party resigned, amind an ongoing delay in the reporting of caucus results.  Former justice department officials, career prosecutors, and lawmakers have expressed alarm at the reversal of a sentencing recommendation in the Roger Stone case following a tweet from Donald Trump. Four career prosecutors stepped down following the reversal, and one of them left the justice department entirely.  The attorney general Bill Barr has agreed to testify before the House judiciary committee.  The US and Taliban are reportedly close to agreeing to a partial week-long ceasefire.

Photograph: Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images    Marie Yovanovitch, the US ambassador to Ukraine who provided key testimony in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump said the state department is in trouble. “We need to re-empower our diplomats to do their job. We can’t be afraid to share our expertise or challenge false assumptions,” Yovanovitch said, speaking at Georgetown University, where she was being awarded by the School of Foreign Service. “Working off of facts is not the trademark of the deep state but of the deeply committed state ... Truth matters,” she added, echoing the words of National Security Council officer Alexander Vindman, who also testified about Trump’s conduct toward Ukraine.  Yovanovitch retired from the state department last month. In May, she was abruptly recalled from her post in Kyiv, after she was targeted by allies of the president, including his personal lawyer Rudy Guiliani and his associates.  The ambassador’s appearence at Georgetown was her first public appearance since she testified before Congress. The university invited her to a ceremony where she was honored for “Excellence in the Conduct of Diplomacy”. The award has been previously presented to secretary of state Madeleine Albright, former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan.       11.46pm GMT       Donald Trump has conditionally approved a peace deal with the Taliban, which would withdraw American troops from Afghanistan more than 18 years after the US invaded, according to reports. From the New York Times:   The deal will only be signed if the Taliban prove their commitment to a durable reduction of violence over a test period of about seven days later this month. If the Taliban do end hostilities and a deal is signed, the United States would then begin a gradual withdrawal of American troops, and direct negotiations would start between the Taliban and Afghan leaders over the future of their country. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo informed Afghanistan’s top leaders in separate phone calls on Tuesday that Mr. Trump had given tentative approval to this approach, according to a senior Afghan official briefed on one of the calls.   The administration has said it was working on a deal for months. Talks with the Taliban were temporarily stalled in September.

Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP via Getty Images    The Culinary Union, an influential force in Nevada politics, released a flier yesterday warning that Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for all plan would “End Culinary Healthcare” .  Ahead of the Nevada caucuses next week, the group, which has not endorsed a candidate in the primaries, singled out Sanders among the top six Democratic candidates running for president as the one who will end union healthcare. The Culinary Union represents 60,000 hotel and casino workers in Nevada and it provides health coverage for more than 130,000 people. Although Elizabeth Warren’s healthcare plan is similar to Sanders’ plan, the union flier says that hers would “Replace Culinary Healthcare after 3-year transition or at end of collective bargaining agreements”.  The Nevada Independent first reported the news. The union had previously cast both Sanders and Warren as candidates who want to take away hard-won union healthcare. In a statement issued today, the group’s secretary-treasurer Geoconda Argüello-Kline said, “It’s disappointing that Senator Sanders’ supporters have viciously attacked the Culinary Union and working families in Nevada simply because our union has provided facts on what certain healthcare proposals might do to take away the system of care we have built over 8 decades.” It’s unclear what effect the union’s despite with Sanders’ will have on his chances in Nevada . The group is encouraging members to participate, and directing them to early voting sites.  Sanders’s Nevada state director responded: “We will guarantee that coverage is as comprehensive or more so than the health care benefits union workers currently receive, and union health clinics, including the Culinary’s health clinic, will remain open to serve their members.”    Updated at 6.55am GMT     9.53pm GMT    Summary    Here’s a summary of where things stand:  Stunned reaction continued to unfold to a justice department reversal of a sentencing recommendation in the case of Roger Stone after Donald Trump complained on Twitter about the original recommendation. Four career prosecutors stood down from their posts in apparent protest following the reversal, and one of them left the justice department entirely. Trump said he did not want to comment on whether he was considering a pardon of Stone “yet”. “No one even knows what he did,” Trump said. Stone was convicted in October by a jury of his peers on seven felony charges including obstruction of justice and witness tampering for misinformation he gave to investigators examining Trump campaign ties to Russia. The House judiciary committee said attorney general William Barr, whom Trump congratulated for acting on his complaint about the Stone case, had agreed to testify on 31 March.  Justice department veterans reacted to the Stone case news with distress, saying that Barr was enabling Trump’s efforts to use justice as a sword against his political enemies and as a shield for his friends. A week after voting to acquit Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, Republican senators dismissed concerns about the sudden twists in the justice department:     GOP senators downplay Barr move to lessen Stone sentence. Some critical of timing of Trump tweet, but say they believe DOJ that it made the decision on Stone before Trump tweeted his fury at the sentencing recommendation of 7-9 years. https://t.co/wFvAmBZau0 pic.twitter.com/hfboOxsO6k&mdash; Manu Raju (@mkraju) February 12, 2020     In the Democratic presidential race, Bernie Sanders declared victory in New Hampshire, with Pete Buttigieg coming in second.

Axios broke the news on Tuesday night.  The lawyer, Jessie Liu, was US Attorney for the District of Columbia starting in September 2017 – a role in which she oversaw prosecutions of Trump allies or former allies including Stone, Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn. Late last year, Liu was tapped to become undersecretary for terrorism and financial crimes at the Treasury department, and she resigned her US attorney post in December. Then, suddenly on Tuesday, Trump withdrew the nomination – for reasons that have not yet come to light. Liu herself found out about the decision on Tuesday, Axios reported. There’s speculation that the withdrawal could be tied to the Stone case before he is sentenced next week or could be tied to the Flynn case, for which sentencing has not yet been set.

Here’s why they’re different and why we should all be concerned about DOJ’s new sentencing recommendation in the Roger Stone case, which rejects its own initial proposal for one more in keeping with what the President called for on Twitter. Among the Founding Fathers’ chief goals was to do away with a government where the king was above the law and had absolute power over the lives of his subjects. In our system, the President, like every other citizen, is meant to be subject to the law. The Founding Fathers were explicit about that intention when they debated the shape the new government they were creating would take. And that quintessentially American view that no man is above the law has been the case up until the presidency of Donald Trump.

Why? Because we’re a state that’s heavily diverse,” he said. “It’s really a state that represents what the country is all about.

Every Republican who voted to acquit Trump for his corrupt actions enabled and owns this.      In New Hampshire Tuesday night. Photograph: Elise Amendola/AP      Donald Trump can continue his corrupt rampages and vendettas because elected Republicans do nothing. They lack the courage and backbone shown by four career prosecutors who stepped down rather than facilitate the Attorney General’s corrupt scheme. But we are not powerless. Congress must act immediately to rein in our lawless Attorney General. Barr should resign or face impeachment. And Congress should use spending power to defund the AG’s authority to interfere with anything that affects Trump, his friends, or his elections. I am the only candidate to propose an independent DOJ task force to investigate crimes by Trump administration officials. Every Democratic candidate must commit to it—so Trump officials know they will be held accountable by career prosecutors once he is out of office. Abusing official power to protect political friends and attack opponents is common in authoritarian regimes like Putin’s Russia. Trump and Barr’s conduct has no place in our democracy. To end it, Congress must act—and the American people must hold them accountable in November.        5.54pm GMT       Wall Street yawns about Bernie Sanders because they think Trump would demolish him in a general election, Ben White writes at Politico:  An avowed democratic socialist narrowly won the New Hampshire primary, propelled by promises to jack up taxes on the rich, nationalize health care and take a sledgehammer to the nation’s banking behemoths.

Just last year, he gave a speech in which he blasted progressive district attorneys who “style themselves as ‘social justice’ reformers” and then “spend their time undercutting the police, letting criminals off the hook, and refusing to enforce the law”. When these prosecutors do bring charges, he complained, they seek “pathetically lenient sentences”. Barr’s message was clear: the integrity of the criminal justice system had to be protected at all costs.     In January. Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images    Given Barr’s track record of fulmination against weak prosecutors, it came as something as a surprise yesterday when he intervened in the case of longtime Trump associate Roger Stone. Stone – an attention-seeking Republican bit-player whose crimes against fashion alone warrant a heavy sentence – committed a series of felonies including obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and lying to Congress during the Mueller investigation. In turn, these crimes stemmed from Stone’s attempts to obfuscate his contact with WikiLeaks during the 2016 election. The crimes which Stone has committed are precisely the sort which threaten the ability of the criminal justice system to operate smoothly and fairly. No investigation can proceed effectively when a witness has to worry about a message he has received telling him to “prepare to die”, which is just one example of the missives which Stone dispatched to another Mueller witness, Randy Credico, in an attempt to force his silence. Precisely because they interfere with the operation of criminal justice system, federal sentencing guidelines deal with crimes like threatening witnesses particularly harshly. Rather too harshly, it turns out, for Bill Barr.

The warning is stark: attorney general William Barr’s intervention in the case at Trump’s behest crosses a historic line, beyond which the health of justice department independence and the integrity of the rule of law dwell under ominous skies. Trump has a long history of attacks on norms of justice department independence, stoking conspiracy theories about a deep state at work wherever the cogs of justice have ground too closely to him or his friends through investigations advanced by agencies ranging from the FBI to the special counsel’s office to the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.  Trump has snubbed justice to do favors for allies in the past with casual pardons of figures such as the race-baiting conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to campaign finance charges, and former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was convicted of contempt of court in 2017 for defying a judge’s order to stop racially profiling Latinos. But the willingness of Barr to intervene in specific cases to protect Trump allies while separately constructing special channels to investigate and potentially prosecute Trump’s perceived political enemies constitutes a major erosion in the basic structures of independent justice still in place, the president’s critics from both parties say. The conduct also appears to be part of a pattern. Last month, the justice department softened its sentencing recommendations in a case involving Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser. The alarm sounded by four prosecutors who removed themselves en masse from the Stone case has been heard throughout the network of career justice deparment officials, including a former attorney general:    Jonathan Kravis, Aaron Zelinsky, Adam Jed and Michael Marando — Department of Justice heroes.

Jill Filipovic: ‘Don’t count Biden or Warren out just yet’ Here is the story you’re going to hear about the New Hampshire primary: that it was Klobuchar’s night, and that her campaign has new momentum. And indeed, after a strong debate showing, she has seen a notable spike, going from being one of the many at the bottom to one of the few toward the top. But pundits like a horserace and, to mix metaphors, there’s an advantage to being the underdog. Elizabeth Warren has hovered around third in the polls for months; she was third in Iowa. And yet her showing was met with a shrug. This is affecting the coverage of Sanders, too. Even though he won New Hampshire, the narrative is that he did worse than last time. Of course he did! There are a ton of candidates in the race – it follows that votes will be divided more broadly. Novelty isn’t always the most accurate way to cover a race. [...] Art Cullen: ‘Klobuchar is the new credible centrist candidate’ It’s no surprise that Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg came out on top in New Hampshire as they bounced out of muddled Iowa. I was so bleary-eyed from watching a year’s worth of TV debates that I couldn’t see how Amy Klobuchar’s performance last weekend would vault her into the game. But it did. She parlayed a strong effort in Iowa into a finish just behind Buttigieg. Each of them heads to South Carolina with many questions in the African American community. Buttigieg had problems with his police department as South Bend mayor and Klobuchar was a prosecutor from Minneapolis who carries the same baggage Kamala Harris did.

But Trump has a major wind at his back in the form of a feeling among an unusually large number of Americans that they are better off than they were the proverbial four years ago, according to surveys including a new poll released Wednesday morning by Gallup.     Gallup: 60% of Americans say they are better off now than when Trump took office compared to just 36% who say they are not.That is higher than during the reelection campaigns of Obama, W, Clinton, or HW Bush.60% of independents say they&#39;re better off than three years ago. pic.twitter.com/d3SBMf0cx0&mdash; Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) February 12, 2020    Gallup:   Sixty-one percent of Americans say they are better off than they were three years ago, a higher percentage than in prior election years when an incumbent president was running. In the 1992, 1996 and 2004 election cycles, exactly half said they were better off. In three separate measures during the 2012 election cycle, an average of 45% said they were better off.

Strzok was fired in August 2018. At a rally in Minnesota in October, Trump read from messages between Page and Strzok, from August 2016, three months before the election. Apparently pretending to have an orgasm, the president said: “I love you, Peter! I love you too Lisa! Lisa, I love you. Lisa, Lisa, Oh God, I love you, Lisa. “And if [Hillary Clinton] doesn’t win, Lisa, we’ve got an insurance policy, Lisa! We’ll get that son of a bitch out.” The messages between Strzok and Page were made public during Mueller’s Russia investigation.

He also tweeted that Stone’s proposed sentence compared unfavorably to a shorter sentence handed down in 2018 to an unnamed “Swamp Creature”, thought to be a reference to James Wolfe, a former Senate staffer convicted of lying to the FBI.  Stone was found guilty last November of seven crimes including obstruction of justice, lying to Congress and witness tampering. He was the sixth former Trump aide to be convicted in cases triggered by special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.

Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPA    Meanwhile, Politico writes here about how powerless Democrats feel to curb Trump’s excesses after his impeachment acquittal. “Coupled with the president’s blatant retaliation against those who helped expose his wrongdoing, the Trump administration poses the gravest threat to the rule of law in America in a generation,” said Adam Schiff, who was the lead prosecutor in Trump’s impeachment trial. The Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal said Trump’s actions since the acquittal – including his firing of impeachment witness Lt Col Alexander Vindman and Vindman’s twin brother – have seemed “almost delightedly vengeful” and are cause for “very deep and profound concern and alarm”. Trump has also suggested the military take disciplinary action against Alexander Vindman.  Even some Republicans are worried – for their control of the Senate.  Trump “is always going to do a little crazy every week because a little crazy is what motivates his base”, one unnamed strategist told the Washington Post. “But this is a team sport, and he does not want to lose the Senate. You saw what happened when he misjudged 2018 and lost the House. He got himself impeached. The Senate is the backstop.”    Updated at 2.30pm GMT     12.30pm GMT       Entrepreneur Andrew Yang dropped out of the Democratic race last night after a quixotic campaign that drew a small but devoted following (“the Yang Gang”) but failed to make significant progress.

Could Bernie Sanders potentially wrap up the nomination on Super Tuesday – the 3 March primary date when numerous states including behemoths California, Texas and Massachusetts all vote, and a third of all delegates are awarded? With the moderate vote split, it’s possible, Democrats have been telling Axios:   Scenario #1: Bernie’s Super Tuesday vote share is five points ahead of the second candidate (say, 30% to 25%). Bernie would net 96 delegates more than the next-highest-performing candidate. At that point, it would be possible but difficult to overtake Sanders: To become the nominee, that survivor would need to beat Bernie by an average of 53% to 47% in in remaining contests. Scenario #2: Bernie’s Super Tuesday vote share is 10 points ahead of the second candidate (say, 30% to 20%). Bernie would net 198 delegates more than the next-highest-performing candidate. Overtaking Sanders would be unlikely: The field would need to clear, the and survivor would need to win each remaining contest on average 55% to 45% over Bernie. Scenario #3: Bernie’s Super Tuesday vote share is by 15 points ahead of the second candidate (say, 35% to 20%). Bernie would net 328 delegates more than the next-highest-performing candidate. The race would be all but over.  Here’s a link to the current delegate count, but obviously with only two small states having voted so far it’s not terribly illuminating. The current numbers are:  Buttigieg: 22 Sanders: 21 Warren: 8 Klobuchar: 7 Biden: 6  The winner needs 1,990 delegates.     Updated at 12.21pm GMT     11.57am GMT    Who is Amy Klobuchar?       Amy Klobuchar. Photograph: Barcroft Media/Barcroft Media via Getty Images    When the results came in from the three tiny towns that traditionally vote first in New Hampshire, Amy Klobuchar posted them straight to Instagram. “We’re off to a great start in New Hampshire today!” the Minnesota senator wrote about the midnight vote tallies from Dixville Notch, Millsfield and Hart’s Location that showed her ahead of the Democratic pack with a total of eight votes. But her joke presaged a successful night which has saved her campaign – for now at least. Klobuchar came in a strong third in New Hampshire with nearly 20% of the vote, behind her fellow moderate Pete Buttigieg on 24.4% and the Vermont socialist Bernie Sanders with 25.7%. Some of the credit can go to her punchy performance in Friday’s debate, in which she attacked Buttigieg for his youth and inexperience, telling him that “59 – my age –is the new 38 up here”. The jab also drew attention to the fact that the other top contenders Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden are all in their 70s. But Klobuchar kept the focus on the former South Bend mayor, slamming him for saying he would rather watch cartoons than Trump’s “exhausting” impeachment trial.  “It is easy to go after Washington, ’cause that’s a popular thing to do,” said Klobuchar. “It is much harder ... to lead, and much harder to take those difficult positions.” While Buttigieg presented himself as a “cool newcomer”, she said, “I don’t think that’s what people want right now. “We have a newcomer in the White House, and look where it got us. I think having some experience is a good thing.” Klobuchar was born in Plymouth, Minnesota in 1960, and practiced as a lawyer after studying at Yale and the University of Chicago Law School and then moving into politics.  She joined the Senate in 2006, and gained a reputation for working across the aisle, taking a trip to the Baltic states and Ukraine with Republicans John McCain and Lindsey Graham in 2016.  She played a memorable role in the heated confirmation hearings for supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, asking the judge if he had ever been blackout drunk. “I don’t know. Have you?” he asked, repeating the question aggressively. “I have no drinking problem,” she replied calmly. She had talked about her father’s struggles with alcoholism minutes before, and Kavanaugh later apologised.

One bizarre story recounted by the New York Times claimed she used a comb to eat a salad in the absence of a fork and then gave it a staff member, telling them to clean it. “Am I a tough boss sometimes? Yes,” she has said when asked about the allegations. “Have I pushed people too hard? Yes.”  Her policies as a presidential candidate are probably best described in relation to her more leftwing rivals. She thinks the Green New Deal – a proposed programme to tackle climate change and create jobs – is too ambitious and expensive, and makes the same argument about Medicare for All, the policy backed by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren that would replace the health insurance industry with a publically-run scheme.  Aware that she needed to seize her moment in the national spotlight, Klobuchar used her speech in New Hampshire on Tuesday night to look past her party and address the nation. “Hello America, my name is Amy Klobuchar and I will beat Donald Trump,” she vowed. But she faces an uphill struggle to unite the Democratic centrist vote – which is now split between Klobuchar, Buttigieg, Joe Biden and Mike Bloomberg, who plans to join the race on 3 March for Super Tuesday. “There is no evidence that she can get non-white voters,” one Democratic source told Politico. She is polling in low single digits in Nevada and South Carolina – the next states to vote – and is doing only marginally better nationally.  But as Sanders surges forward on the left and Biden fades, the Democratic establishment will eventually need to settle on a candidate. Klobuchar has a small window now to make the case that it should be her.     Updated at 2.38pm GMT     9.58am GMT       Bernie Sanders got the clean victory he was denied in Iowa last night in New Hampshire, with a win over rival Pete Buttigieg that was closer than expected but avoided the chaos of last week’s Iowa caucuses. With 87% of precincts reporting in the second race of the 2020 Democratic primary, the socialist Vermont senator had won 25.7% of the vote to 24.4% for the young former mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Amy Klobuchar, meanwhile, a moderate senator from Minnesota, will be pleased with her strong third place finish and 19.8% of the vote. It was another lacklustre night, though, for Elizabeth Warren, Sanders’ rival on the Democrats’ liberal wing, and Joe Biden, the former vice-president who had entered primary season the favourite and his seen his star dramatically wane.  Sanders’ share of the vote was way down on the 60% he received in this state in 2016, although that was pretty much a two-horse race with Hillary Clinton, in contrast to 2020’s panoply of candidates.  With around 26% in both Iowa and New Hampshire, it is clear he has a strong and loyal base of support, particularly among the young and those on the left, and he may now be the frontrunner. But he has not yet proved he can win over centrist votes within the party, some of whom are bitterly opposed to him for both policy and personality reasons. Rather than consolidating its strength, however, the centrist wing of the Democratic party seems only to be fracturing further.  Biden is in serious trouble, and rushed on yesterday to South Carolina, which votes on 29 February and is a must-win for him with its large African American population, seen as a key part of his voting coalition. But in between is Nevada, which is likely to be a very tight race between the centrist former VP and a buoyant Sanders.  Buttigieg placed strongly in New Hampshire, but is unlikely to make much headway among the diverse electorates of Nevada and South Carolina, and it’s notable that his national polling has not (yet?) seen a dramatic rise.  Klobuchar’s third-place finish last night gives her a chance to make the case that she should be the standard-bearer for the moderate wing. “Hello America, my name is Amy Klobuchar and I will beat Donald Trump,” she told a crowd last night, seizing her chance to address not just the Democratic party but the nation.  And Mike Bloomberg remains a great unknown, planning to join the race on 3 March for Super Tuesday after spending hundreds of millions of dollars advertising in large states. This continued division in the centre only benefits Sanders, who seems to have seen off Warren, his key competitor on the left. Warren’s candidacy hit the rocks when her policies – particularly her expensive comprehensive healthcare plan – came under a severe spotlight. The same may now happen to Sanders as he takes on the role of frontrunner.  The Republicans also held a primary race, as Trump was quick to point out. Trump got 85.5% of the vote, while the former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld got 9.2% – a much stronger showing than his result in Iowa last week, 1.3%.  You can see all the New Hampshire results here:    Related: New Hampshire primary results: track the votes as they come in    We’ll have live coverage of all the fallout here today.  Roger Stone case We’ll also cover the continuing controversy over the sentencing of Trump’s longtime friend and unofficial adviser Roger Stone.  Yesterday four lawyers who prosecuted Stone resigned in protest after their sentencing recommendation was overruled and slashed by Donald Trump’s justice department. The department’s move came after Trump tweeted of Stone’s original sentence recommendation: “This is a horrible and very unfair situation ... Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!”  Stone was found guilty last November of seven crimes including obstruction of justice, lying to Congress and witness tampering. He was the sixth former Trump aide to be convicted in cases triggered by the special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.  The justice department is supposed to operate independently of the White House in criminal investigations and prosecutions. The final decision on Stone’s fate will rest with US district judge Amy Berman Jackson, who repeatedly took a harsh tone with Stone during the trial in Washington. Stone’s sentencing is expected on 20 February.

98,crime,New Met police bid to share crime victims’ data with Home Office,"Scotland Yard has drawn up a new policy to ensure officers continue the deeply controversial practice of sharing data on victims of crime – including domestic and sexual violence offences – with the immigration authorities. After a previous legal challenge from campaigners to stop the “unlawful practice” the Met ditched the policy earlier this year. Yet it has emerged that the force has redrafted the controversial measure, issuing new guidance which is almost identical to the previous policy it withdrew. The move is now the subject of fresh legal action by Southall Black Sisters and a domestic abuse victim represented by the human rights group Liberty, in an attempt to prevent police passing on information about people suspected of being in the country illegally to deportation authorities if they come forward as victims or witnesses of crime.   Related: Green party calls for breakup of Home Office after Windrush scandal    Their case argues that handing over such people to the Home Office for immigration enforcement undermines the fight against crime and erodes public safety. It also means individuals may remain in situations where they are repeatedly abused or forced to participate in crime. One victim of violent and sexual domestic abuse, who is among those bringing the legal challenge against the Met, said that her husband had threatened to kill her, but that she had never reported him to police for fear that officers would report her to the Home Office. She was afraid that she risked being detained and potentially deported to her country of origin, where she faced persecution because her marriage had failed.     Pragna Patel of Southall Black Sisters. Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian    Aisha, not her real name, entered the UK legally and has worked for many years, but partly as a result of her husband’s abuse is currently deemed an “overstay”. She said she was “really frightened” about what might happen to her. “I worry that he is now so angry that he might just kill me as he has threatened to do. If I was not worried about the Home Office being told about me, I would contact the police as I am so scared of him. But I am stuck now,” she said. Following a judicial review brought by Liberty earlier this year the Met decided to drop the heavily criticised policy. Instead the force redrafted the policy in a document finalised on 11 August and called “vulnerable victims and witnesses with insecure immigration status”. It was launched three days later on 14 August. The Met’s new policy states: “Where police are investigating a crime, and during that investigation, whether on the initial report or subsequently, it becomes apparent that the victim/witness is also suspected of being an illegal immigrant, it is wholly appropriate that the officer in the case should contact immigration enforcement.” Debaleena Dasgupta, Liberty lawyer, said: “The Met is failing to protect victims of crime. Unless a data-sharing policy ensures all victims can seek police protection and report crimes without fear of immigration enforcement, it risks being unlawful. “She added: We hope the Met will withdraw this policy and replace it with one that allows victims to access their protection and seek justice.” Liberty has written to Met lawyers saying the “updated policy remains unlawful on exactly the same grounds as the previous one”.    The police must do the right thing and separate from the immigration enforcement arm of the state  Pragna Patel, Southall Black Sisters     Court documents from the human rights group to the Met state: “The policy sends a clear indication to investigating police officers that they should inform HOIE [Home Office Immigration Enforcement] of a suspicion that a victim is an illegal immigrant, in other words that passing this information on is mandatory.” Pragna Patel, director of Southall Black Sisters, said she had worked with “countless” women who “are frightened to exit from abuse and seek police protection because they fear being reported to the Home Office”. She added: “It’s time for the Met to decide who it serves – it can’t serve both the public and the Home Office at the same time since this leads to a conflict in duties and in discriminatory outcomes for abused migrant women. “The Met Police and indeed other police forces across the UK must do the right thing and separate from the immigration enforcement arm of the state.” A super-complaint into the sharing of data on victims with immigration enforcement authorities is currently being investigated by police watchdogs. It is being investigated by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, the Independent Office for Police Conduct, and the College of Policing, and could lead to recommendations including that police forces change their policies or working practices. Dasgupta added: “In the longer term the government must implement permanent separation between all essential frontline services and immigration enforcement so everyone can access support free from fear.” "
99,crime,Fear of Brexit disorder fuels Tories’ tough talking on crime,"The idea that yet another prison-building programme, and tougher sentencing, will reduce victimisation and increase public protection is a fallacy (Tories unveil law and order policy blitz amid election speculation, 12 August). In 1983, Leon Brittan instigated the biggest prison-building programme of the 20th century, alongside a tougher sentencing regime. It failed. In 1995, Michael Howard declared that “prison works”. He was wrong. There are no demonstrable relationships between prison numbers and recorded crime rates. This “blitz” will not solve the conventional crime problem. Nor will it deal with corporate criminality, income tax evasion, environmental pollution or deaths at work. The cultures of immunity and impunity that allow the rich and powerful to engage in routine criminal activity will remain. The changes will do little, if anything, to reduce the rampant levels of violence against women, nor far-right extremism, and nor will they introduce desperately needed structures of democratic accountability into the criminal justice system. But they will likely exacerbate the dramatic levels of violence in British prisons, where there are almost two self-inflicted deaths a week. Given the crisis in the criminal justice system, the hypocrisy of this headline-grabbing stunt is disgraceful.Joe Sim Professor of criminology, Liverpool John Moores University, Steve Tombs Professor of criminology, The Open University • It is not surprising to see the Tories resurrecting “law and order” to deflect from other troubles. However, it may be advisable to look at those troubles, in particular Brexit, as a major reason why these tougher measures are being proposed. A variety of official government statistics, police recorded information, occupational surveys in the NHS and any casual viewing of mainstream and social media reveal a sharp rise in negative and violent behaviour since the 2016 vote. Homicides are up from 570 in 2015-16 to 726 in 2017-18. Hate crime incidents increased from 62,518 to 80,392 over the same period. These figures are the highest since recording began in 2011-12. Knife killings are the highest recorded since statistics were first collected in 1946. Racist incidents against Metropolitan police officers rose from 428 in 2014-15 to 667 in 2016-17. There were 26,000 assaults on police in 2017-18. An NHS staff survey found 15% of employees had been assaulted by patients, their families and the public. The same survey revealed up to 75,000 assaults nationally in 2016-17. The media is increasingly showing attacks on paramedics and on police officers being attacked (and filmed) when attending incidents. Behaviour in the House of Commons has reached an all-time low and news reporters seem only interested in provoking rows and shouting. I would suggest that Brexit is as much a public protection issue as the sentences served by certain offenders. Fortunately, serious sexual and violent offenders remain relatively scarce. A sharp decline in standards of civility and the active promotion of a climate of disrespect and hate threatens our social fabric far more.Dr Mike NashEmeritus professor of criminology, University of Portsmouth • Your editorial (Stop and search won’t stop violent crime. We need to address the root causes, 12 August) quite rightly observes that Boris Johnson “has reverted to a familiar and failed Conservative playbook of ‘hard on crime, hard on criminals’ rhetoric”. The proposals to extend stop and search and increase prison places and police numbers all appear to be part of Boris Johnson’s positioning prior to a likely early election. Any moves towards an evidence-based “public health” approach to knife crime have clearly been ditched. There is one aspect of this, though, that you miss. The PM’s announcement eased restrictions on the use of section 60 powers across all forces in England and Wales. Knife crime is not endemic across England and Wales. The idea that this is a response to knife crime therefore is not plausible. This retooling of the state is in anticipation of resistance to Johnson’s future agenda. As we saw in the Thatcher years, a putative response to a panic about a rise in crime can cloak a rearming of the repressive machinery of the state for use against anyone who resists. When Priti Patel says she wants offenders to feel terror, what she means is that all those who will be written out of any future Tory settlement of the issues of the day should feel terror. This is a government committed to a course of action – a no-deal Brexit, which will make the poorest and most exploited poorer still. It is being packaged as a reclaiming of “freedom”. Once the nationalist, anti-immigrant rhetoric results in a brave new world where the NHS is flogged off to US insurance companies, unemployment rises, food prices go up and wages fall, Johnson will need the “terror” of the state as his ultimate defence. The idea he cares, or ever has cared, about the causes of crime is nonsense. As mayor of London, Johnson didn’t open new youth centres. He wasted £320,000 on water cannon. Oppression is his first instinct.Nick MossLondon • The only fear likely to be generated by the government’s stop-and-search policies is the fear justifiably felt by young black people up and down the country that they will be repeatedly harassed by the police when going about their lawful activities on the streets. The evidence consistently shows that well over 90% of those subject to “suspicion-less” stops are found to be entirely innocent.

100,crime,A Good Woman Is Hard to Find review – gritty Northern Ireland crime thriller,"The flicker of exploitation-movie glee in the title of Abner Pastoll’s third feature flowers horribly in the central dilemma facing single mother Sarah (Sarah Bolger) when her home is invaded by criminal bottom-feeder Tito (Andrew Simpson). Like The Wire’s Omar, he is a dealer who steals from other dealers, looking for somewhere to stash his ill-gotten gains. Not only must Sarah shield her two children from the interloper, but there’s the issue of whom the drugs really belong to. Set in an unnamed Northern Irish city (with soaring drone shots of Belfast), A Good Woman Is Hard to Find also semi-successfully blends in kitchen-sink grit, emphasising Sarah’s precarious status in trips to the supermarket where she struggles to settle the bill, and her vulnerability in the micro-aggressions she’s subjected to from the security guard. But the social aspect isn’t as morally resonant in the film as Paul Andrew Williams mustered in London to Brighton. The subplot about Sarah’s son – left mute after seeing his father stabbed to death – feels underdone. But the opportunistic genre-welding holds together thanks to vivid performances. Bolger makes a slightly implausible character arc completely convincing, graduating from panicky improvisation to grim determination. And Edward Hogg, as the teeth-baring Mancunian crime boss prone to discoursing on the correct use of metaphor (joining Sexy Beast’s Don Logan and In Bruges’s Harry in the ranks of pedantic Brit kingpins), confirms his standing as a sorely underused asset of the UK film industry. Extra points are earned for the best weaponising of a dildo. • A Good Woman Is Hard to Find is released in the UK on 25 October.           "
101,crime,Netanyahu calls for sanctions over ICC war crimes investigation,"Benjamin Netanyahu has called for sanctions against the international criminal court and people who work for it, a month after its chief prosecutor announced she intended to investigate alleged Israeli war crimes. “I think that everybody should rise up against this,” the Israeli prime minister said in an interview with Trinity Broadcasting Network, the world’s largest Christian television network. “The US government under President Trump has spoken forcefully against the ICC for this travesty, and I urge all your viewers to do the same. To ask for concrete actions, sanctions, against the international court – its officials, its prosecutors, everyone.” Netanyahu’s calls come months after Washington used a similar tactic to block a separate potential ICC investigation into its troops’ conduct in Afghanistan. It announced in March that it would deny entry to ICC officials, and later revoked a visa held by the ICC chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda. ICC judges later refused to open the investigation, citing a lack of cooperation from parties involved, including Afghan authorities and the Taliban, but also the US. It was not clear if Netanyahu intended to also block ICC officials from entering the country, which could hamper its work because Israel controls access to the West Bank and Jerusalem. The case involving Israel follows years of preliminary investigations. Bensouda said in December that she would seek to open a formal inquiry into alleged continuing war crimes in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. It would look at alleged crimes carried out by both Israelis and Palestinian armed groups, including Hamas, which has been accused of “intentionally directing attacks against civilians”, according to Bensouda’s office. She intends to investigate incidents during the 2014 Gaza war between Israel and Hamas. The case could also be expanded to include the alleged killings by Israeli soldiers of more than 200 Palestinians, including more than 40 children, at demonstrations along the Gaza frontier during the past two years. Separately, Bensouda argued there was a “reasonable basis” to believe that Israeli authorities had committed war crimes by moving Israeli civilians into the West Bank to live in settlements. Under the Geneva convention, signed after the second world war, the transfer of civilians into occupied land is prohibited. In his interview, Netanyahu, who intends to declare large parts of the Palestinian territories as Israeli land, said the ICC was impinging on “Israel’s right, the Jewish people’s right, to live in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel”. While Israel rejects the court’s jurisdiction and has not signed up to the international treaty, the ICC’s mandate is to prosecute people, not countries, including those from states that are not signatories. The Israeli government has also argued that as Palestine is not a state, it should not be allowed to petition the court. Palestine used its UN observer state status, gained in 2012, to join the ICC. Before opening the formal investigation, Bensouda has requested that ICC judges “confirm” the court’s jurisdiction over the occupied Palestinian territories."
102,crime,ICC to investigate alleged Israeli and Palestinian war crimes,"There is sufficient evidence to investigate alleged Israeli and Palestinian war crimes committed in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, the international criminal court has announced. In a landmark decision, the ICC said it saw “no substantial reasons to believe that an investigation would not serve the interests of justice”. The announcement ended years of preliminary investigations into alleged crimes by both Israeli forces and Palestinians, and signalled that the court was preparing to open a formal investigation. A statement published by the court’s chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, on the court’s website on Friday said her office “has concluded with the determination that all the statutory criteria under the Rome statute for the opening of an investigation have been met”. “In brief, I am satisfied that war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip”. Bensouda’s statement followed a legal opinion published earlier on Friday by Israel’s attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, arguing that the court had no jurisdiction in the West Bank or in Gaza – apparently intended to pre-empt an imminent decision. Despite the unprecedented statement by the court, which had been initially petitioned by the Palestinian Authority, Bensouda added that she had referred the question back to the court to “confirm” the court’s jurisdiction over the occupied Palestinian territories. “I have sought confirmation that the ‘territory’ over which the court may exercise its jurisdiction, and which I may subject to investigation, comprises the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza,” she said. “Such determination is made strictly for the purposes of determining the court’s ability to exercise its jurisdiction and the scope of such jurisdiction under the statute,” Bensouda added. The ruling was immediately condemned by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who described it as a “black day for truth and justice” and a “baseless and scandalous decision”. The Palestinian Authority, however, welcomed it in a statement demanding proceedings go forward without further delays. “After nearly five years of preliminary examination, the Palestinian people who seek redress in this court expect actions congruent with the urgency and gravity of the situation in Palestine and they rightly demand that these steps are taken without delay.”   Related: Netanyahu criticised in damning report on 2014 Gaza war    The full ruling by the court details the “reasonable basis to believe that war crimes were committed in at least three incidents during the 2014 Gaza war” by members of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), including “intentionally launching disproportionate attacks”. More widely, the ruling argued that the court believed there was a reasonable basis to believe that Israel had “committed war crimes … in relation to the transfer of Israeli civilians into the West Bank since 13 June 2014.” It added that the scope of any formal proceedings might be expanded to include “an investigation into crimes allegedly committed in relation to the use by members of the IDF of non-lethal and lethal means against persons participating in demonstrations beginning in March 2018. The investigation also identified evidence to support claims of war crimes against Palestinian armed groups, including Hamas. “In addition, there is a reasonable basis to believe that members of Hamas and Palestinian armed groups committed the war crimes [including] intentionally directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects and using protected persons as shields; wilfully depriving protected persons of the rights of fair and regular trial and wilful killing or torture and/or inhuman treatment and/or outrages upon personal dignity.” The question of jurisdiction is likely to be fiercely contested. Under the Rome statute that established the court, it can hear cases only if one of the parties is a signatory. While Israel, like the US, is not a party to the convention, the court accepted Palestinian membership in 2015. While the prosecutor’s office has argued that its “primary position” is that Palestine is a state for the purposes of the treaty that established it, in his legal opinion on Friday Mandelblit argued that because Palestine was not a sovereign state the court had no jurisdiction. “The claim that the Palestinians have purported to join the Rome statute does not meet, nor can it replace, the substantive test requiring criminal jurisdiction to have been delegated to the court by a sovereign state with a defined territory,” he said. A full ICC investigation could lead to possible charges being brought against individuals. States cannot be charged by the ICC. The nearly five-year preliminary investigation has looked at the 2014 war, which left 2,251 dead on the Palestinian side, the majority of whom were civilians, and 74 on the Israeli side, most of them soldiers. It has also looked at violence near the Israel-Gaza border in 2018. Earlier this month, the ICC prosecutor refused to press charges over a deadly 2010 Israeli raid on a flotilla bringing aid to Gaza, and urged that investigation to be shut. Nine Turkish citizens died in May 2010 when Israeli marines stormed the Mavi Marmara, which was among eight ships trying to break a naval blockade of the Gaza Strip. One more died in hospital in 2014."

In “the most Darren Aronofsky thing of all time”, the director decided on having the exclamation mark at the end of the title of his 2017 film before he’d even written the script, because it “reflects the spirit of the film … at the end of it, there’s a big exclamation point.” Somewhere in east London, a hipster bakery that sells sourdough starters is cursing him for beating them to that name.Grammar police verdict Starts wrong, ends badly.

104,crime,From drones to spice: how one academic uncovered the changing face of crime in prisons,"James Treadwell is professor of criminology at Staffordshire University. His research, commissioned by the Staffordshire Police, Fire &amp; Crime Commissioner, Matthew Ellis, has inspired a groundbreaking multi-agency approach to addressing rising levels of crime within the prison system. Alongside colleagues from the University of Leicester, Treadwell spent six months speaking to prisoners, prison staff and law enforcement agencies in Staffordshire to better understand criminality in custody and the ability of prisoners to manage organised crime from behind bars. It has been common, according to Treadwell, for the police to consider their job done once a criminal is behind bars. “Actually, if you put very serious criminals into prison without recognising that they continue to present an ongoing threat, it’s not ‘job done’ at all,” he says. “It’s merely a short stay of adjustment before they’re back to their old ways.” In Staffordshire – which has more prisons than any other area in the country – Treadwell’s research has led to new recognition that the police and the prison services have a shared mission. As a result, the two agencies have begun working together in new ways. “There’s a much better understanding of how the police and prison services can cooperate together to get good results,” says Treadwell. “And that’s led to the police commissioners in the Midlands being very much the ones who are feeding into the national government strategy to reduce drug-fuelled violence in prisons.”     Drones can be used to fly drugs into prisons to be sold within the system. Photograph: abadonian/Getty Images/iStockphoto    At the heart of the research is a drive to understand how crime in prison is changing and the factors that cause it. The researchers spoke to prisoners who’ve been involved in violence against other prisoners, or who’ve been victims of violence in prison. “We looked at what drives that – and it’s not just men living cheek by jowl in complex and difficult environments,” says Treadwell. “A lot of the violence is linked to the illicit economy in prisons and, in particular, the drug market moving inside.” The fact that prisons are profitable marketplaces is “a story of technological shift and transformation” in itself. New psychoactive drugs, such as spice and black mamba, can be sprayed on to clothing to be smoked, making them hard to detect but easy to transport inside prisons. These substances can also be flown over the wall of a prison using drone technology, while social media and mobile phones enable individuals to coordinate that trade. Consequently, drug use in prisons has become much more prevalent.   Related: Gamers, their search for inner meaning – and how that could transform the workplace    “Linked to the growth of drug taking in prisons is the fact that some prisoners – particularly those engaged in organised criminality – wish to try to control that market,” says Treadwell. “Those involved include former prisoners, prisoners, and sometimes the contacts of the prisoners on the outside as well. Essentially, crime in prison, particularly drug crime, has become very, very big business.” As the organised crime market has moved inside, there has been a decline in prison safety and an explosion of prison-based violence, often tied to the drug economy. The question at the heart of his research is how to police prisons when they’re essentially “a massive market for drug distribution”, and many of the key players aren’t fearful of criminal sanction, since they’re already behind bars. Part of the answer lies in the prison service better recognising the threats and problems that it faces. “The prison service can often be quite a reactive organisation, so if someone is causing trouble in a prison they can be seen as the problematic prisoner,” Treadwell explains. “But it’s often the prisoner who’s compliant and seemingly nice to staff who is supplying all the drugs into that wing and running an empire of sorts that intimidates, exploits, threatens, and undermines the good order and discipline of the prison.” While the system has got better at detecting organised crime, Treadwell says those prisoners create a challenge for a prison service formed in the Victorian period. “There can still be a tendency to think of organised crime as looking like the Krays when, in fact, the world, including organised crime, has moved on considerably.” Ellis describes the research as a detailed examination of “the very practical challenges” prisons in the West Midlands face daily and says it underpins the importance of all agencies involved with criminal justice working together to achieve their goals. “Doing that would result in a step change in the effectiveness of the whole criminal justice system for our society,” Ellis says. “That work is ongoing and the report serves as a stimulant to do more, understand more and, importantly, understand more about the priorities and challenges in other parts of the same criminal justice system.” The work fits into a broader picture of groundbreaking academic research at Staffordshire University, which is working to cement its position as a civic university. Treadwell says his work (which includes co-hosting a podcast, Crime Tapes) is driven by the desire to “be curious and daring” and by the recognition that the world is constantly changing. “The criminal use of drones to supply drugs to prisons was actually very foreseeable, and we can already see how cryptocurrencies will be involved in the drug trade in future, but you’ve got to prepare students to ask the right questions,” he says. “For a long time, those in academia were not looking at the right things, they were patting themselves on the back and congratulating themselves on falling crime, whereas in reality crime had just shifted.” Ultimately, Treadwell says his research is about making the world a better place. “I want to have prisons where people can be rehabilitated because they’re safe environments,” he says. “Prisons where prisoners aren’t preyed on by drug dealers and violent criminals, and where the state actually runs the prison, and not the mafia.”"
105,crime,"Police letting down older victims of crime, say inspectors","Older victims of crime are being let down by the police and the wider criminal justice system, according to the first inspection report on the age group. The police have only a “superficial understanding” of the crimes committed against older people, the report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services and Her Majesty’s Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate says. Older people account for 18% of the population but more than eight out of 10 victims of doorstop scams are elderly, the report says. Older people also comprise a quarter of domestic homicide victims. “Despite these statistics and the fact that we have an increasingly ageing population, the two inspectorates found that the police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) lacked any joint cohesive and focused strategy to deal with older victims of crime,” says the report. Inspectors found that out of 153 cases where a safeguarding referral should have been made by police to the local authority, on 77 occasions there was no any evidence of this taking place. Of the 192 cases the inspectorates looked at in detail, victim care was found not to be good enough in 101 of them and the victims’ code was complied with on only 97 occasions. “As people are living increasingly longer, it is imperative that the needs of older people are properly understood by those charged with protecting them,” said the inspector of constabulary, Wendy Williams. “Unfortunately, our inspection found that older people are often not treated according to their needs by the criminal justice system. We want to see a sharper focus on older people and the problems they face.” John Beer, the chair of Action on Elder Abuse, said: “This is a truly damning report about the way the criminal justice system treats older victims. Action on Elder Abuse has led the call for a specific offence or aggravating factor of elder abuse, in recognition of the devastating impact crime has on older victims. As a society we already recognise that where a victim is targeted because of their race, religion, sexual identity or disability, a tougher sentence should apply.” In October last year the home secretary, Sajid Javid, asked the Law Commission to review hate crime legislation with a view to including age as a protected characteristic. This has not been taken forward. Beer said: “In the meantime older people are suffering at the hands of criminals every day and being let down by the justice system to boot. This has to stop now.” The inspectorates made a series of recommendations aimed at the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC), the CPS and the College of Policing (COP). Ian Pilling, the NPCC lead for adults at risk, welcomed the recommendations. “We are considering enhancing training and guidance provided to officers, as well as increasing the profile of crimes against older people,” he said. “However, our resource constraints mean that we cannot deal with every victim in the way they would like and indeed in the way we in policing would like to be able to.” Janette McCormick, the director for policing standards at the COP, said: “We will be working with agencies to examine the report and its recommendations in detail and continue to support policing to improve the protection of vulnerable people, whatever their age.” A CPS spokesperson said: “This week we published updated policy and legal guidance for our prosecutors which address many issues in the report. We have accepted all the inspectorates’ recommendations.”"
106,crime,Giri/Haji review – Kelly Macdonald crime show is all killer and no thriller,"Younger siblings, eh? They are either the attention-sucking baby of the family, leaving you out in the cold, or a thorn in your side causing trouble from cradle to grave. Detective Kenzo Mori feels your pain. When a Yakuza boss is killed on Mori’s beat, threatening to destroy the fragile truce that has been maintained for the last few years, it appears that the killing may have been undertaken in revenge for a murder in London that Mori’s younger brother, Yuto, carried out. Yuto was believed dead, but nobody ever saw the body and there has been a rumoured sighting of him. Mori’s boss – a man possibly ensnared in the Yakuza web himself – requires his underling to go to London and pretend to be a student on a detective refresher course while he does some unofficial digging. The theory goes that Yuto is more likely to reveal himself to his brother than anyone else. So begins Giri/Haji (Duty/Shame), an intercontinental thriller and co-production between the BBC and Netflix. The latter – which will air the series globally next year – provided the deep coffers needed to split the setting between Tokyo and London. Mori is played by Takehiro Hira, who gives the detective a bone-deep weariness that makes increasing sense as we see, via a series of flashbacks involving Yuto, that it is not just the burden of ageing parents and a rebellious teenage daughter weighing him down. (Yosuke Kubozuka lends Yuto a needy, nervous energy that justifies what might otherwise seem unconscionably extreme service from his brother.) In London, Mori puts out feelers among the Japanese community in his search for leads. A half-Japanese young man, Rodney, proves a useful conduit, but Mori discovers he is also a rent boy with a complex and dangerous life, in which he soon becomes embroiled. In a scene-stealing turn from Will Sharpe, Rodney is full of brio and wit (“I’ll have to ring you back,” he sighs theatrically into his phone when an emotional ex-boyfriend turns up. “I’m in the middle of a Greek play”). But he also has a vulnerability that makes us care instantly about his fate; possibly too much, given his ability to get into perilous situations soon and, one fears, often. At a club Rodney introduces him to, Mori hears rumours of an assassin who fled Tokyo and is making his mark in London. He sets out to pursue the lead below the radar. Above the radar, he soon deduces, he is being watched and, where possible, thwarted. The plot thickens. Meanwhile, his refresher course is being run by Detective Sarah Weitzmann (Kelly Macdonald, using her patented form of stoic anguish to full effect), a lost soul in her own city; ostracised at work and harassed at home – albeit inventively, with snakes pushed through her letterbox by ill-wishers. So far, she and Mori have done little but exchange awkward pleasantries. But whatever continent the protagonists come from, we have been here before and international relations will surely take place before series end. Herein lies the problem with Giri/Haji. Apart from the novelty of seeing Japan’s capital unfetishised – this is a Tokyo where people live, work and manage the daily grind, not a neon-soaked fun palace or futuristic hellscape – and the odd animated interlude (created by the company behind Hey Duggee, fact fans), nothing here feels new or revelatory. Lonely, troubled detectives torn between loyalty to a ne’er-do-well relative and their professional duty are a staple of police series – and they are often in unsuspecting conflict with corrupt powers above them, too. For the fish out of water to be Japanese rather than American or European provides some nice cultural cosmetic detailing – like Mori bowing to the taxi driver who drops him off after his first black cab ride, and the man speeding off before he has even straightened up – but the bones are the same. So far, at least. Not all the episodes were released for review, though they will all be available on iPlayer after the first has aired. I am hoping that the actor playing Roy, the London detective sent to Tokyo in Mori’s place, gets something more to do. Being cast simply so one of your new colleagues can deliver the line “He looks like a fucking sex tourist” seems harsh."
107,crime,Scandal over Britain's failure to notify EU of crimes – an explainer,"The UK failed to pass on the details of tens of thousands of foreign criminals to their home EU countries and concealed the scandal, the Guardian has learned. The police national computer (PNC) error went undetected for five years.   Related: Revealed: UK concealed failure to alert EU over 75,000 criminal convictions    What is the police national computer? According to the College of Policing, the PNC is used to help investigations and sharing information of both national and local importance. It provides critical services to the police, UK law enforcement and criminal justice agencies throughout the UK and it also links in with the European-wide IT system known as the Schengen Information System (SIS II) that enables all participating member states to share real-time information on persons and objects of interest via a series of alerts. The PNC provides real-time checks on people, vehicles, crimes and property. How does the PNC alert European partners? The PNC generates daily activity files based on all the latest updates and any related to foreign offenders are meant to be forward to the European Criminal Records Information Exchange System (ECRIS) by a body known as ACRO Criminal Records Office. What is ECRIS? According to the European Union website, ECRIS was established in April 2012 to improve the exchange of information on criminal records throughout the EU. All EU countries are connected to ECRIS. The database ensures that information on convictions is exchanged between EU countries quickly and simply and provides judges and prosecutors with easy access to information on the criminal history of persons concerned. It also removes the possibility for offenders to escape convictions by moving from one EU country to another. What is ACRO? ACRO Criminal Records Office is a national police unit that provides a range of services to organise criminal records information and improve the links between criminal records and biometric information. It is also responsible for international police data sharing. What has gone wrong with this system? It has emerged that ACRO failed to pass on details of 75,000 convictions of foreign criminals to their home EU countries via ECRIS. Why has this happened? It appears to be a software glitch. ACRO has responded by developing a “software script” to fix the issue. What are the implications of the error? Dangerous foreign offenders once released from prison could return to their home countries without local authorities being aware of their presence. How does this all fit into Brexit? There have been warnings from law enforcement agencies about the impact Brexit could have on cross-border information sharing. But this relates to an error with the domestic PNC, which ACRO is working to correct. However, it has been revealed that the Home Office initially chose to conceal the embarrassing failure from EU partners. It also follows revelations that the British authorities had made “unlawful” full or partial copies of the database that were said by an EU report to pose “serious and immediate risks to the integrity and security of SIS data”. Both have served to undermine trust between the UK and the bloc."
108,crime,The 20 best true-crime shows ever,"The Dropout Available on iTunes/variousHer love of black rollnecks and a fake baritone voice might have made her a favourite of Twitter meme-makers, but the case of fraudulent US entrepreneur Elizabeth Holmes is actually rather dark. Inspired by Wall Street Journal writer John Carreyrou’s book Bad Blood, The Dropout podcast explores how the former Stanford student jacked in her studies to charm investors and big businesses alike with a supposedly revolutionary but actually useless blood-testing device. Like Enron for millennials, the endeavour itself is less important than the confusion and cult of personality that grew around it. HJD              The Keepers  NetflixIn 1969, Sister Cathy Cesnik, a nun and teacher at Archbishop Keough High School in Baltimore, was murdered by person(s) unknown. This seven-part documentary isn’t so much a hunt for her killers as a harrowing study of the long-term effects of child sexual abuse and the city-wide corruption that can allow it to go unchallenged. The schoolgirls Sister Cathy taught are now in late middle age, but have never given up on finding justice for the teacher who tried to protect them. EEJ The Jinx  Google Play/YouTubeAn oddball real-estate tycoon, suspected in the disappearance of his first wife, goes on the run after his best friend’s murder 18 years later. He lives undercover as a mute woman until the discovery of a dismembered corpse once again draws police attention. After fading from public notice for a few years, he offers himself up to director Andrew Jarecki for 20-plus hours of interview, culminating in a rambling “hot mic” confession. And that’s just the basic outline. File under “you couldn’t make it up if you tried”. EEJ OJ: Made in America  AmazonThere are reasons to study true crime beyond simple ghoulishness. Nothing tells us more about a place and time than its most famous murder. For late-20th-century America, it was the double killing of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman and the subsequent acquittal of OJ Simpson. This staggering five-part, eight-hour odyssey takes in LAPD racism, America’s intoxication with sports celebrities, the way domestic violence was (and is) habitually ignored in well-to-do communities and much more. It’s a portrait of a nation in crisis. EEJ     Cuba Gooding Jr. &amp; Joseph Bttler in American Crime Story: The People vs OJ Simpson. Photograph: AF/Alamy    American Crime Story: The People vs OJ Simpson  NetflixYes, the wigs deserve a spin-off series of their own, but there is also serious reflection at the heart of this shamelessly entertaining series. Ryan Murphy, the trash TV maestro behind Glee, American Horror Story and Feud, here brings together a cast combining his regulars (Sarah Paulson as prosecutor Marcia Clark, Connie Britton as Faye Resnick) with unexpected star turns (David Schwimmer as Robert Kardashian) to create a TV show that’s part true-crime classic, part Kardashians origin story. Even if you already know the details, the cumulative effect is mesmerising. EEJ Capturing the Friedmans  Google Play/YouTubeCan you ever really know the truth? That is the deeply troubling subtext of this documentary by Andrew Jarecki (a film-maker whose career, along with The Jinx, has now been blessed by not one but two great true-crime exclusives). In the late 80s, Arnold Friedman and one of his three sons were accused of molesting boys who attended the computer classes they ran. While awaiting trial, the Friedmans began shooting home videos of family interactions both mundane and bizarre. Piecing together this footage with interviews, Jarecki asks us what to believe: was this whipped-up hysteria or something more sinister? EEJ The Central Park Five  AmazonIf there is one thing true-crime documentaries teach us, it’s “never trust a New York real-estate tycoon”. In April 1989, a white woman in her late 20s was brutally raped in Central Park, leaving her in a coma for 12 days. Amid intense media interest, and based on dubious confessions, the police quickly rounded on their suspects: five Harlem teenagers, four black and one Hispanic. Yet even among the many examples of human error and structural racism that led to their wrongful conviction, Donald Trump’s idiotic interventions stand out. It’s part of what makes this particular miscarriage of justice so enduringly relevant. EEJ S-Town  iTunes/variousAfter Serial, there was S-Town. Brian Reed’s backyard maze of a podcast used listeners’ interest in murder mysteries to lure us into a much richer and more novelistic tale. Or was it Reed’s endlessly compelling subject, John B McLemore, who did the luring? Either way, early listeners of this Alabama-set hit were advised to reserve judgment until at least episode two. By then, the story’s true themes had begun to emerge: antique clocks, buried treasure, environmental ruin, unconsummated romance and the strange ways of the American south. EEJ              Making a Murderer  NetflixThe series that transformed true-crime TV from late-night infamy to mainstream success, Making a Murderer combined an unbelievable real-life story with painstaking production from writer-director duo Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos. Steven Avery – a Wisconsin man who had been wrongly convicted of rape and attempted murder, then charged with a second killing – provided the perfect subject, but it was Ricciardi and Demos’s film-making over 13 years that brought this possible miscarriage of justice to life, even if the second run didn’t manage to match the momentum of the first. HJD Atlanta Monster  iTunes/variousThe Atlanta Child Murders, which took place from 1979 to 1981, are not unsolved crimes – at least not officially. A man named Wayne Williams has been sitting in prison for the last 37 years, convicted of two murders and suspected in the rest. But something doesn’t quite add up. For the second of his investigative podcasts, Up and Vanished’s Payne Lindsey moves from small-town Georgia to the big-city, majority black setting of Atlanta. What begins as a sensationalist serial-killer hunt soon expands into something much more complicated. EEJ Serial  iTunes/variousHelmed by This American Life journalist Sarah Koenig, Serial was a thrilling yet tragic podcast that also offered an intelligent exploration of a flawed US justice system and the lives of two first-generation immigrants. Over the course of 12 episodes, Adnan Syed – imprisoned for the murder of girlfriend Hae Min Lee – found himself alternately critiqued and validated by Koenig via their prison phone calls. Their dynamic highlighted the flaws and triumphs of modern journalism, while expanding the reach of the true-crime podcast. HJD              The Moorside  AmazonThe faked abduction of Shannon Matthews by her mother Karen in 2008 was one of the grimmer UK news items of recent times. So it was to the credit of writer Neil McKay that he found a way to tell the story that felt reasonably nuanced. Sure, the dysfunction at the heart of the tale was bleak. But thanks to the humanity and defiance of Sheridan Smith’s Julie Bushby (the neighbour who organised the search for Shannon but eventually uncovered her mother’s deception), this BBC drama actually became an almost uplifting parable of community resilience under pressure. PH The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story  NetflixForget about the whodunnit element: the killing takes place in the opening episode and, in any case, the killer’s identity is well known. This alternately glitzy and horrifying tale works instead as a study of cause and effect. Showing Andrew Cunanan’s life in reverse chronological order, it manages to interrogate fame and aspiration in modern America and paint a picture of the desperation and loneliness of some gay lives in the very recent past. At the heart of the story is an extraordinary performance by Darren Criss as the terrifying yet initially oddly sympathetic Cunanan. PH The Staircase  NetflixThis was where the modern episodic true-crime craze began. Back in 2004, Jean-Xavier de Lestrade did a remarkable job of bringing the bewildering story of Michael Peterson to light. Peterson’s wife Kathleen died in December 2001 and Michael was accused of her murder. But what began to unfold feels like an uncanny precursor to the later likes of Making a Murderer, a confirmation that the truth really can be stranger than fiction. Had something like this happened to Peterson before? Could the prosecutors be trusted? And what on earth was “the owl theory”? PH Dirty John  iTunes/variousWhile slick conman John Meehan follows a long line of American grifters, his gall is particularly impressive. Having been incarcerated for drug theft, the former nurse anaesthetist targeted California businesswoman Debra Newell, posing as a doctor and slowly inveigling himself into her life and affairs to dangerous ends. While Meehan’s unkempt appearance and general shadiness left some listeners wondering how Newell didn’t cotton on earlier, this podcast from feted US network Wondery and the LA Times (which also became a Netflix series) highlights his knack for compulsive, complicated lies. HJD              Mindhunter  NetflixAlthough best known as the director of films such as Fight Club and Seven, David Fincher’s minutely detailed technique also lends itself perfectly to prestige-era television. His 2017 Netflix series Mindhunter provided the perfect vehicle for this kind of auteur approach. A thriller focused more on the psychology of crimes than the gore of them, it’s based on the true story of how the FBI’s Behavioural Science Unit came to exist. With the steady, tell-rather-than-show type of storytelling that made Mad Men similarly compelling, it was unsettling, slow-burn TV at its best – and there is a second series on the way. HJD Appropriate Adult  AmazonThe awful story of Fred and Rose West – who assaulted and killed a host of vulnerable young women between 1967 and 1987 – has long reverberated through British society and popular culture, with documentaries through the decades focusing on the pair. ITV’s Appropriate Adult – which first aired in 2011 – took a slightly different tack, focusing on Fred’s relationship with Janet Leach, a social worker who chaperoned him in police interviews. Dominic West plays Fred with just the right mix of ineptitude and coldness, in what is a compelling, unusual drama. HJD See No Evil: The Moors Murders  Google Play/YouTubeLike Fred and Rose West, a sense of fear and fascination has long surrounded Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, from namechecks by the Smiths and Manic Street Preachers to Marcus Harvey’s 1995 painting of Hindley made up of children’s handprints. This 2006 ITV drama offered a dark and naturalistic portrait of the pair, with Maxine Peake and Sean Harris in the central roles. Although arguably overly neutral towards Hindley, it was a striking one-off, made in consultation with the victims’ families. HJD Criminal  iTunes/variousAlthough the vast majority of them might seem to, true-crime podcasts don’t just focus on violence and murder. Criminal is an example of combining smart, longform storytelling with the genre to make something unpredictable and varied. Telling the tales of “people who’ve done wrong, been wronged, or gotten caught somewhere in the middle”, this long-running US series hasn’t had a breakout star like Serial’s Adnan Syed, however it manages to offer something genuinely engrossing with each episode, from police violence and counterfeit currency to black market adoption and captive animals. HJD              Wild Wild Country  NetflixThis six-part doc series tells the story of an Indian spiritual guru, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh – or Osho to his followers – his personal assistant Ma Anand Sheela, and the community of devotees they assembled on their “Big Muddy Ranch” in Wasco County, Oregon. While we learn early on that wire-tapping, immigration fraud and poisoning were part of the picture here, it’s the way in which these disparate elements and more come together in Osho’s cult that make this such an intriguing and troubling watch.

109,crime,The best recent crime and thrillers – review roundup,"    If you are among the 60% of UK residents who, according to a recent study, have suffered nuisance neighbours, then Louise Candlish’s Those People (Simon &amp; Schuster, £12.99) is guaranteed to have you vibrating with impotent fury on behalf of the denizens of Lowland Way in south London, whose smug suburban lives are rudely shattered by the new arrivals from hell. With their endless messy renovations, top-volume thrash metal, appropriation of parking spaces and obduracy in the face of entreaties and threats, Darren and Jodie set the community by the ears, and soon the veneer of civilisation is wearing very thin indeed. Some lovely dark humour and the delicate, merciless filleting of human interactions more than make up for a few longueurs in this carefully crafted psychological thriller.      Another middle-class suburb, this time on the outskirts of Sydney, is the setting for Australian journalist Felicity McLean’s first novel, The Van Apfel Girls Are Gone (Point Blank, £12.99). Suffused with the same tantalising intensity as Picnic at Hanging Rock, it’s the time-slip narrative of three sisters who went missing in the summer of 1992, and the quest of their now-adult school friend, Tikka, whose life has been clouded by the tragedy, to understand what happened to them. Hannah, Ruth and the unsettlingly beautiful Cordelia are the daughters of Christian zealots, and the two older sisters are desperate to leave their oppressive home. As in Picnic at Hanging Rock, there’s plenty of barely suppressed sexual hysteria – most of it coming from Mr Van Apfel. Although the adults in the community are uneasily aware of the danger signs, they fail to intervene, and it’s not until Tikka attempts to piece things together that they begin to talk about what they’ve seen. A coming-of-age drama as much as a crime story, this isn’t a book for those who like things wrapped up neatly, but readers who enjoy something haunting, atmospheric and genuinely mysterious have a treat in store.      The Whisper Man (Michael Joseph, £12.99) by Alex North is a police procedural with supernatural overtones, and here – unusually – it is boys rather than girls who have gone missing. The search is on for six-year-old Neil Spencer, whose disappearance from the village of Featherbank has eerie echoes of a series of child abductions and murders that took place 20 years earlier. The killer, known as the Whisper Man, is now in prison, but DI Pete Willis, who worked on the case, has started to wonder about the existence of an accomplice. Meanwhile, recently widowed Tom Kennedy and his young son Jake move to Featherbank in search of a fresh start, but their new house seems to be attracting attention from some strange quarters. Jake’s imaginary friends, hitherto a source of comfort, have become downright sinister. A gripping exploration of father-son relationships with a propulsive plot, The Whisper Man is a true skin-crawler.      For her debut novel, Your Truth or Mine? (Pan, £12.99), Trisha Sakhlecha takes a microscope to the outwardly successful marriage of Mia and Roy Kapoor. The disappearance of Roy’s colleague Emily cracks open the fault lines to reveal a complex web of lies, self-deception and duplicity. The spouses take it in turn to narrate as their union gradually unravels in a welter of unmet expectations, recriminations and bad judgments, and events from the past begin to impact on the present. Well written, with plenty of twists and an excellent sense of place – the book is set in Rajasthan and London – this is a fascinating British Asian spin on domestic noir.      Mick Herron is fast becoming the go-to author for British espionage, and the sixth novel in his Slough House series, Joe Country (John Murray, £14.99), is up to his usual high standard. Slough House, fiefdom of the fabulously repulsive Jackson Lamb, is the naughty step for failed MI5 operatives, its “slow horse” inhabitants doomed to spend the remainder of their careers grinding through repetitive tasks. However, when Louisa Guy goes off piste because of a request by the ex-wife of her lover, now-deceased slow horse Min Harper, the team wind up floundering around a snow-bound Wales. There they become embroiled in a plot involving misbehaviour in very high places, blackmail and treachery. Aficionados can expect Herron’s trademark snappy dialogue, memorably flawed characters and sharp political observation; newcomers are advised to start at the beginning of the series.      Andrew Martin’s latest novel, The Winker (Corsair, £16.99), takes place at the beginning of the 1976 summer heatwave. The titular character, pint-sized psychopath and failed pop star Lee Jones, picks people up in smoke-filled pubs before dispatching them in the hope that murder will be his path to fame (although, given the assonance, “winker” doesn’t seem a very desirable moniker). Charles Underhill, mysteriously exiled in Paris for something he did in his youth, is troubled by a series of anonymous postcards that hint at knowledge of his past, and recruits a struggling young novelist to find out who is sending them. The result is an immersive and highly enjoyable game of cat-and-mouse with perfect period texture and some nicely wry humour. • Laura Wilson’s latest novel is The Other Woman (Quercus)."
110,crime,First Love review – a bloody slice of Tokyo pulp fiction,"Less than three minutes into Takashi Miike’s First Love, a severed head rolls into an alleyway, eyes wide open and blinking in shock. Eye-popping is one way to describe the prolific Japanese director’s 103rd film, a cheerfully pulpy Tokyo-set noir. Leo (Masataka Kubota) is a boxer, hunkily brooding and ambivalent in an Alain Delon in Rocco and His Brothers kind of way (or maybe, with his red jacket, James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause). He has unfulfilled potential, with little to live for – until he runs headfirst into damsel in distress Yuri, aka Monica (Sakurako Konishi), an addict and sex worker on the run from the mob. On their tail is the enraged girlfriend of Yuri’s now-dead pimp (Becky Rabone, in a gleeful and deranged riff on the gangster’s moll), as well as a comical, coked-up yakuza named Kase (Shōta Sometani). There’s also the ghost of Yuri’s abusive father, who appears at inopportune moments wrapped in a large white sheet. Kôji Endô’s thundering jazz-rock score amplifies Miike’s tendency towards playful cartoon excess. A seemingly benign mechanical puppy triggers an explosion. In another adrenaline-fuelled scene, the action literally explodes into an anime sequence in homage to the elderly Japanese stuntmen whose blockbuster car chases Miike was inspired by. These tonal swerves temper some of the more flamboyant violence.           Watch a trailer for First Love. "
111,crime,'I was devastated': the crime victims made to give up their phones,"In January 2017, a 30-year-old man reported himself to the Metropolitan police. He informed officers he had been having sex with a minor and had potentially given him a sexually transmitted infection. The minor, a 12-year-old boy, confirmed the details of the abuse and rape to police officers in February 2017. 
Despite the age of the victim, which meant the case was a matter of statutory rape with no defence of “mistaken reasonable belief”, and the admission by the perpetrator, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said a review of the boy’s phone was required for a charging decision to be made. Among the data the Met’s specialist unit were instructed to extract and review were 40,000 messages from the boy’s phone. 
The boy’s family instructed lawyers at the beginning of 2018 when they became frustrated by the failure to promptly charge and prosecute the perpetrator. The boy’s lawyers repeatedly asked the CPS and the Met why an extensive review of 40,000 files of personal data was required for a charging decision to be made. In June 2018, the CPS maintained that charges would not be pressed until police had reviewed the data on the minor’s phone. Days later, the Met informed the boy’s lawyers that his phone was still three to four months away from being examined as “post-charge cases take priority”. 
“The response demonstrated the incongruous situation that many victims of serious crimes, like our client, may find themselves in. On the one hand, our client was told by the CPS that an unlawful electronic review of his personal data had to take place prior to a charging decision, but on the other hand the police force responsible for such a review admitted that they prioritised reviews of electronic data only in cases where a charge had been made,” Rachel Harger, a solicitor at Bindmans LLP, says. 
Following a pre-action letter for judicial review, a charging decision was made, almost a year and a half after the incident had been reported. The perpetrator was convicted on 20 September 2018 after he pleaded guilty to offences, which included rape, attempted rape and sexual touching of a child under 13. Aamna Mohdin 
 
  
  
   
    
    Police guidance states that when investigating a crime: ""Mobile phones and other digital devices such as laptop computers, tablets and smart watches can provide important relevant information and help us investigate what happened. This may include the police looking at messages, photographs, emails and social media accounts stored on your device.""
    In investigating rape or sexual assault, the police my use that data to verify where a victim was at the time of assault, and if they had prior contact with the suspect. They are also obliged to disclose evidence to the suspect's defence teams. Defence lawyers have accused police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) of failing to hand over crucial digital evidence in rape and assault cases that would have exonerated their clients.
    Victims of rape and serious sexual assault who refuse to give police access to their mobile phone contents have been told they could allow suspects to avoid charges, and&nbsp;cases have been dropped.
    There is an underlying problem for police in the sheer volume of text, video and call records now available in even routine cases, and particularly in domestic abuse or sexual assault allegations involving people who already know each other - and this has been a factor in the sharp drop in the number of cases reaching court.&nbsp;
    
   
  
  
 
Barbara’s story 
The string of high-profile historical sex abuse cases following the death of Jimmy Savile prompted Barbara to come forward to police to report the abuse she had suffered at the hands of a family friend in the 70s and 80s. 
“I didn’t think I would ever report it. I didn’t think I was strong enough and I didn’t think I would be believed,” Barbara says. It took a year to find the perpetrator and four more women came forward to report abuse by the same man. 
However, once the case was being investigated, Barbara was asked to give police access to the contents of her phone. “When they asked for my phone I felt like I wasn’t believed. I felt like I was under investigation. Mobile phones weren’t invented when I was abused in the 70s and 80s,” Barbara says. 
Barbara agreed to disclose the entire contents of her phone to the police, including Facebook and WhatsApp messages, in order to pursue the case. “I don’t think the police particularly wanted to do it. The argument was that if I didn’t give my phone over it looked like I had something to hide. If they didn’t have my phone, his defence might be able to say that I had colluded and that could place reasonable doubt in the jury’s mind. I felt like I didn’t have anything to hide but I was devastated.” 
Her phone was not returned for seven months. “They took away my means of calling for help and my support network. As he wasn’t on bail I was permanently convinced he was going to come after me and he was going to get me. Even though he’s an old man and I’m a grown-up now, I was terrified. Every time I went out I was constantly scanning and looking for him and because I didn’t have my phone I felt so vulnerable as I couldn’t call for help if I saw him.” 
Barbara says about 30,000 pages of evidence were extracted from her phone and some of the information was passed to the defence and used to try to discredit her in court. 
“The defence accused me of attention-seeking, doing it for money and of having false memories. Those were the three main tactics the defence used. They used my messages and messages my friends had sent me against me in court. Again, at a time when you’re feeling really vulnerable and low, to have his defence barrister use your words against you is just horrific.” 
The case took almost four years to come to trial. Her abuser, Michael Murphy, was convicted of sexual abuse including rape over a 30-year period and described by the judge as a “serial predatory paedophile”. He was sentenced to 16 years earlier this year. 
However, Barbara feels that using evidence from her phone to try to cast doubt on her character and memories is indicative of the limitations of the jury system. 
“Juries don’t work. There needs to be a panel of experts because juries don’t work for this kind of trial. People don’t have enough understanding of what trauma is and that memories aren’t always clear. The upshot is that people who are guilty are walking around, making our society more dangerous.” Caelainn Barr"
112,crime,Crime and Punishment review – a damning look at our desperate prison system,"When Pandora gave in to temptation and opened the boxful of ills that humanity had until then been spared, she managed to keep just one from escaping. Out flew disease and death and destruction, but hope was saved because, the ancient Greeks knew, it was the one thing without which mortals cannot survive. It is this eternal truth that lies at the heart of Channel 4’s heavyweight documentary series Crime and Punishment, which was filmed over two years and sets out to explore every aspect of the criminal justice system. The opener dwelled mostly in prison. It followed two prisoners in HMP Winchester serving Indeterminate Public Protection (IPP) sentences: Aaron Harris, since 2006, for a serious assault; and Paul Bousell, for robbing a shopkeeper at knifepoint seven years ago. IPP sentences were introduced when David Blunkett was in office in 2003 as part of the Blair government’s penal reforms to rebalance the system, as our then leader put it, “emphatically in favour of the victims”. IPPs provided a normal tariff to be served, plus an indefinite extension thereafter, to end only if and when the prisoner was deemed no longer to pose a threat to public safety. They were at least in part a response to the high-profile murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne. Her killer, Roy Whiting, had previously served four years for child abduction; supervision of him had ended just four months after his release. You can probably see many complex problems with many complex solutions here, but Blunkett and Blair plumped for the sledgehammer approach: introducing essentially a whole new system of sentencing. They intended it to be used only for the most severe offenders and estimated that only 900 more people would ever qualify. But, by 2010, more than 10 times that number had been incarcerated under it. After it was ruled a violation of human rights by the European Court of Human Rights, IPPs were abolished – but not retroactively. Therefore, Harris and Bousell remain in a tunnel with no light. Harris self-harms to try to manage his situation. “When you’re hopeless,” he says, inspecting the latest cut he has made, “your behaviour becomes erratic.” Bousell copes by using spice and is often violent towards guards. None of this inspires confidence in a parole board. Harris’s standard tariff was five years; he has been in prison for 13 years. Bousell’s expired four years ago. The programme, rightly, did not sugarcoat the men’s offences, personalities or attitudes, forcing viewers instead to reckon with principle and systemic problems rather than emotions and individuals. Which is not to say it didn’t leave you free to parse your feelings about what you want your prison system to do – punish, deter, rehabilitate or simply incapacitate – and what proportions you are willing to tolerate. How, for example, do you assess risk? If it is cars and traffic, you could probably have a decent go at constructing a workable model. But with people and communities, it is a godlike job. Watching the amount of data set before Bousell’s parole board – a miserable patchwork of records and reports – even the semi-divine might recoil. Of course, the shambolic nature of it all, and the suffering it breeds and embeds, is a result of underfunding – the endless competition between institutions, departments and systems for increasingly scarce resources. The unavoidable impression was of a creaking, cracking edifice full of people who, even if they had the ability, were denied the capacity to do their jobs properly. It is a wonder they muster enough hope to continue. We saw Harris through a brief good patch. He went 50 days without self-harming, was moved to a less restricted unit and was thrilled to have his own food and toiletries shelf and the freedom to call his mum any time he wanted. Then, four weeks away from another parole hearing, he got into an argument about phone credit, cut himself down the muscle of his leg and – after being admitted to A&amp;E – was returned to the main wing, where no one had quite the right resources to deal with him. On it goes. In a 2014 interview, Blunkett admitted that the new law’s criteria should have been clearer, with tougher guidance given to judges and better rehabilitation courses put in place. That lack is something he “regrets very much”. Hopeless."
113,crime,Johnson’s cynical ‘tough on crime’ talk shows the depth of his incivility,"The thesis that Boris Johnson is a liberal in Tory clothing is shot to ribbons. His latest proposals on crime, leaked by a “Whitehall source”, are a shameless lurch to the wilder shores of rightwing populism. In next month’s Queen’s speech, he will apparently “get tough” on crime by increasing the severity of sentences. He wants “life to mean life” for child murderers, together with more prison places, simpler stop-and-search and less early release. His source says “most people think all parties and the courts have lost the plot on sentencing”. Johnson will act “aggressively”. The source – we assume Dominic Cummings or a minion – offers no authority for “most people”. It also turns out that the proposed changes are almost all within the competence of the existing judicial system – and are in reality all for show. There is no call for them from within or outside the prisons. The worsening of prison violence and mental health, and the 70% recidivism rate among young offenders within a year, is glaringly due to austerity cuts since 2010. As the chief inspector of constabulary, Sir Tom Winsor, has written, reacting to Johnson’s proposals, “the cost [of crime] in treasure, blood and human suffering” is caused by the failure of prevention, not the laxity of punishment. We must ask if the new draconianism is approved by Michael Gove, who as justice secretary in 2016 called for a drastic cut in the prison population?   Related: To cut reoffending rates, Boris Johnson should pursue the evidence – not votes | Eric Allison    Johnson is merely repeating Tony Blair’s vote-grabbing “tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime” cynicism. This evening Channel 4 examines the impact of Blair’s get-tough regime through home secretary David Blunkett’s “imprisonment for public protection” (IPP) orders. These orders allowed judges – in effect prison officials – to incarcerate people indefinitely, even when their sentence had been served. It was expected to embrace some 900 tough cases, but ended by imprisoning, without further trial, over 9,000. The programme shows how open-ended sentencing led to mental collapse, drug addiction and self-harm – and prisoners ever less suitable for release. Though IPP was ended seven years ago, some 3,500 prisoners remain under its cosh. Crime is not some satanic visitation, but a result of the way in which countries order their affairs. As De Tocqueville said after studying American jails, “prison is the most complete despotism”, licensed tyranny. Accordingly, societies best show their degree of civility in their prison management. Britain’s prisons, the most crowded in Europe, are appalling and getting worse. British democracy just now is in the grip of a tawdry demagoguery. It is unbelievable that its practitioners can strut the world, lecturing others on civil rights abuses while perpetuating glaring failures on their own doorstep. This year is the 50th anniversary of the abolition of capital punishment in Britain. Johnson’s proposals show how little its penal policy has moved on since then. We shudder at what new obscenity “most people” are ordaining for the new Johnson/Cummings regime. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"
114,crime,Amazon fires: why ecocide must be recognised as an international crime,"Eliane Brum’s passionate attack on the Amazon clearances is well made (In the burning Amazon, all our futures are now at stake, 23 August). In William Golding’s Lord of the Flies, the war between Ralph and Jack leads to the burning of the jungle. The boys are rescued by a naval crew attracted by the smoke and flames. But it is worth noting that Golding had to be persuaded by his editor to change the ending, which was considered a bit bleak for the 1950s, when it was written. He would have been quite happy for readers to take in the consequences of their selfishness and stupidity; the destruction of the place where they live. How he must be chuckling now.Simon SurteesLondon 
• In 1944, Winston Churchill described German atrocities in Russia as “a crime without a name”. Later that year, the term “genocide” was coined. Today the Amazon rainforest – the lungs of the world – is ablaze, with thousands of fires deliberately lit by land-grabbers keen to clear the forest for logging, farming and mining. This destruction, which has increased massively since Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro’s deregulated deforestation, threatens an area that is home to about 3 million species of plants and animals and 1 million indigenous people. 
In order to stop such wanton destruction in Brazil and around the world, it is surely time to recognise ecocide – destruction of the environment or ecosystem – as an international crime. It should not be necessary to name something for it to become real but, as with genocide, a word can help encompass the enormity of a horror that might otherwise be too great to imagine.Stefan SimanowitzLondon 
• There’s a touch of Nero and fiddles in your article (Chicken or beef? Enjoy both on longest nonstop flight, 19 hours Sydney to London, 23 August). The celebration of super technology getting us to Australia hours faster seems deeply misplaced against the background of doom that almost all sane people believe awaits the human stay on planet Earth. Qantas’s chief executive Alan Joyce calls it, without irony, “truly the final frontier in aviation”. The article’s previous point gives the game away: “successful test flights would fire the starting gun on a race between the Boeing and its European rival, Airbus, to sell Qantas their new ultra-long-range aircraft”. It’s about naked competition – the central drive of capitalism which has taken us to the cliff edge. Finding a way collectively to ground the whole system is our only hope of survival.John CharltonNewcastle upon Tyne

115,crime,Surge in violent crime in Barcelona prompts calls for legal reform,"The Catalan government has called for tougher penalties for violent crimes after a surge in knife attacks and violent robberies in Barcelona. Miquel Buch, the regional interior minister, said the law needed to be changed after it emerged that 90% of those charged with violence in recent months had been released on bail. Though Barcelona has long been notorious for its pickpockets and bag snatchers these incidents seldom involved violence. However, police officials say there have been 5,331 violent street robberies so far this year, a 30% increase on 2018. Shopkeepers have also reported a sharp rise in violent robberies. Knives have been used in at least 100 crimes, including robbery, fights and homicide, although police say they have not confiscated more knives than usual.   Related: Why Barcelona is a street crime hotspot – and how to beat the thieves    In June, a South Korean woman who was part of a government advisory body died from head injuries after she fell during an attack by muggers. On Sunday, the Afghan ambassador to Spain, Humayoon Rasaw, was attacked in central Barcelona and his €17,000 (£15,000) watch stolen. Critics of the justice system say many thieves operate with impunity because of a law stating that the theft of property worth less than €400 is a misdemeanour, not a crime. This means many thieves receive only a fine no matter how many times they reoffend. The use of violence is a crime, however, but police say of the 1,529 people charged with such offences, only 165 have been remanded in custody. Despite assurances by the Barcelona mayor, Ada Colau, that the city is safe “but has some security problems”, the US embassy has advised its citizens to beware of the risks of visiting Barcelona. The issue has led some people to blame Colau, immigrants and the law. Some say the rise in violent crime is due to the influx of unaccompanied minors, young boys mostly from Morocco, of whom more than 6,000 have arrived in the city in the past two years and for whom there are few facilities. However, police say the overwhelming majority were not involved in criminal activity. Police and legal experts are at a loss to explain why many of the non-violent thieves who have operated in the city for years are now using force. Violent crime reached a similar peak in the summer of 2012, but declined steadily until 2016 before rising again. The main factor appears to be a surge in tourism, with many visitors proving to be easy pickings for thieves. Ciutat Vella, the old part of the city that attracts the most tourists, has the highest level of street robberies. In the past year there has also been an increase in gangs forcibly stealing expensive watches."
116,crime,Former gaming minister demands Crown investigation over crime link claims,"A former Victorian gaming minister has demanded the state’s gambling regulator investigate allegations aired by Nine against the operator of Melbourne’s casino, Crown Resorts, that include accusations of links to organised crime in China. Tony Robinson, who was minister for gaming in the late 2000s under the Labor premier John Brumby, said the Melbourne casino had the potential to damage the state’s reputation, and the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation must allocate more resources to supervising it. “The regulator has for too long not applied the powers it has to scrutinise Crown adequately and it’s therefore no surprise to see these sorts of stories emerging,” he said. “Regulatory failure in this instance gives rise to criminal enterprise and serious harm to the state.”   Related: Uneasy lies the Crown: weary Packer changes direction and Barangaroo with it    His call came as it emerged Crown was warned Chinese authorities were cracking down on illegal gambling promotion, and the company’s staff were warned to avoid electronic communication to minimise the risk of detection, more than a year before 19 staff were arrested by mainland authorities. In other developments, the independent MP and long-time Crown critic Andrew Wilkie, backed by independent senator Jacqui Lambie, called for an investigation into Nine’s claims, to be conducted by one of federal parliament’s joint committees. Crown shares fell 3.24%, or 41c, on Monday to close at $12.26. The VCGLR’s chief executive, Catherine Myers, said the regulator was continuing an existing investigation into Crown’s activities in China that has already been running for two years, but did not say whether it would look into fresh allegations raised in Nine’s report. However, NSW’s gambling regulator, Liquor &amp; Gaming NSW, said it would “work with other Australian casino regulators to understand if any action should be taken in light of the allegations raised against Crown”. Reports in Nine’s newspapers over the past few days and on its flagship TV current affairs show, 60 Minutes, alleged tens of thousands of leaked internal Crown documents show the casino company has close ties to organised crime through the organisers of junkets run to lure gambling whales from mainland China, where gambling is banned. Nine also accused Crown, which runs casinos in Melbourne and Perth and is building a vast high-roller gambling pit at Barangaroo in Sydney, of putting staff in China at risk. It also claimed the cousin of China’s president, Xi Jinping, was present on a company jet searched by federal police on suspicion of money laundering in 2016. In addition, the former Australian Border Force head Roman Quaedvlieg told 60 Minutes two government ministers complained to him that Crown’s VIP jets “weren’t receiving a facilitated service for private jets coming into Australia” and “were seeking some arrangements which smoothed out the processes there a little”. Court records show Crown was warned that Chinese authorities were cracking down on casino marketing in March 2015, more than a year before its staff were arrested and charged with promoting gambling. The 19 Crown workers were later convicted by a Shanghai court. “It would be well advised to avoid cell phone and text message communications dealing with marketing efforts to the degree possible, and limit overall use while in country,” Crown was told in the report, compiled by US corporate intelligence company Mintz Group. Crown staff should “assume that all communications are either being actively monitored”, Mintz said in the report, excerpts of which were published in a May federal court judgment. “It is for this reason that a phone call is better than a digital message, simply for the reason that it usually requires live monitoring to be productive for an investigation should one occur.”   Related: 'This is a mental health issue': the devastating impact of problem gambling    Nine’s allegations come at a sensitive time for Crown, with the company’s biggest shareholder, James Packer, midway through unloading much of his holding to Hong Kong’s Melco Resorts, headed by his friend and former business partner, Lawrence Ho. Regulators in NSW and Victoria have already flagged probity checks over the involvement in Crown of Ho, whose father Stanley Ho has been banned from involvement with the Barangaroo casino over allegations he has links to triad organised crime groups. There is no suggestion Packer was involved in any of the allegations raised by Nine. The VCGLR’s investigation of Crown’s Chinese imbroglio was delayed after the company told the regulator it would take “many months” to recover emails sought by officials from back-up tapes. It was not completed by the time the VCGLR published its five-year review of the Melbourne casino license in June last year. “The VCGLR is continuing to consider the well-publicised events regarding Crown’s international commission-based business and its international sales team in China,” the VCGLR’s Myers said. “The VCGLR strongly encourages anyone with information related to alleged breaches by the casino operator, to submit this information via this process available on our website.” A Crown spokeswoman said the company “notes the media reports over the weekend which make various allegations regarding Crown’s business dealings”. “Crown takes its legal and regulatory responsibilities very seriously,” she said. She said the company “denies any allegation that it knowingly exposed its staff to the risk of detention or conviction in China.”  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning        “Crown has a robust process for vetting junket operators with whom it deals and undertakes regular ongoing reviews of these operators in the light of new or additional information that comes to its attention.” The Australian federal police declined to answer the Guardian’s questions about whether it was investigating allegations of money laundering or any other potential federal crimes raised by Nine. “The AFP does not confirm who it is or is not investigating,” a spokeswoman said. Robinson said Crown’s Melbourne casino, which is the company’s biggest, was “a single casino which if it doesn’t act in good faith damages the state’s reputation”. “The VCGLR has fallen for the old trick of thinking it’s a manager of paperwork, rather than the state’s regulator,” he said. He said the VCGLR should put more resources into regulating the casino. “The risk of harm that arises to the state from a failure of the casino is infinitely greater than the misdeeds of one liquor license holder and it should be given far more resources. “If they are not investigating the claims that were raised recently then they are failing in their duties.” In federal parliament, the Greens MP Adam Bandt asked the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to guarantee no ministers had lobbied for special treatment for Crown’s high rollers and to rule out any improper behaviour by home affairs officials. “There has been nothing presented to me that would indicate there are any matters there for me to address,” Morrison said. A home affairs spokeswoman said arrangements allowing people arriving by plane to clear the border without going through an international airport terminal had been in place since before 2016. “Travellers arriving or departing through an off terminal clearance process are required to meet the same border clearance requirements as if entering an international terminal,” she said."
117,crime,The Kamala Harris campaign is over. So is the era of the tough-on-crime Democrat,"After being lauded as one of the strongest contenders in a very crowded 2020 Democratic nominee field, Kamala Harris has ended her campaign. While the decision might seem premature, given that she had already qualified for the next round of debates, it seems like a wise decision for a candidate who went into the campaign season expecting her background as a prosecutor to be an asset, but quickly found herself defending her record more than boasting about it. Harris’s firm-handed approach to criminal justice may have been popular when she held the office, but it is increasingly out of step with current thinking and feeling on criminal justice. There has been a strong shift in the last decade on issues like incarceration, cash bail, the criminalization of drug use and sex work, and her record was often diametrically opposed to new ideas on these matters. Her inability to understand that shift, let alone elegantly navigate it, seems to have been her downfall.   Related: After the Obama disappointment, black voters want more than empty symbolism | Malaika Jabali    But more than simply resulting in one fewer candidate on the debate dais, Harris’s exit from the primary process might signal the death of the tough-on-crime Democrat, a role Harris was once able to easily play on her path to power. The us v them mentality, after all, only works if the majority of the electorate considers themselves as one of the “us”. With the world’s highest incarceration rates and a record number of people under supervision in probation and parole systems, however, more and more Americans are finding themselves or their loved ones as one of “them”, the ones the others want to be protected from. It’s easy to see how Harris might have missed the change in the culture, as her career started in an era when building supermax prisons and California’s three strikes law enjoyed tremendous support. Four years after she became a deputy district attorney in 1990, Bill Clinton would sign the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which resulted in the largest increase in incarceration rates in American history. It not only expanded the number of offenses that qualified as federal crimes and increased the number of death penalty offenses, it also eliminated Pell Grants for poor prisoners to continue their education while imprisoned, stripping away even the veneer of incarceration being a time of rehabilitation rather than pure punishment.     Kamala Harris missed the change in the culture. Other candidates are faring better with the changing times. Photograph: Mike Blake/Reuters    As Harris ascended into the position of San Francisco district attorney in 2003, the electorate made it clear its primary concern was safety. It was the year of the Abu Ghraib scandal, when photos surfaced of army and CIA personnel torturing and humiliating prisoners in an Iraqi prison. And while there was some outrage, there was a greater sense that Americans would tolerate whatever it took to “keep us safe”, even if that included torture, the loss of civil liberties and the beginning of mass surveillance. At the time, then, taking action like jailing mothers for their children’s truancy – school dropouts were often scapegoated as budding delinquents and criminals, with education being the only exit ramp from a depraved life – or prosecuting sex workers in a misguided attempt to protect women from trafficking were seen by the public as being reasonable approaches to crime prevention. But that era has ended, and not with the perfectly safe society envisioned by the politicians that advocated for a tough approach on law and order. Instead, we got private companies profiting wildly from our prison system, as prisoners and their families are charged exorbitantly for reading books, calling loved ones, or even visitation. Companies who use underpaid prisoner labor face boycotts and backlashes. Controversies about the militarization of our cities’ police forces continue to grow. And polls suggest a growing number of voters care deeply about making real changes to this system. With a growing prison abolition movement on the left, with some of its ideas and figures gaining mainstream attention, Harris’s record looks more punitive than protective, and she had not adequately addressed things like the times when her office fought to keep people behind bars even when their convictions were overturned or lab work was revealed to be inaccurate. Every few months there seems to be a new documentary series on an innocent man imprisoned for a crime he didn’t commit showing up on Netflix. Her record seems to hold as many landmines as goldmines. It didn’t help that Harris’s campaign had so many former Hillary Clinton staffers or that she sought the support of so many of Clinton’s donors. Nor did she seem to learn from Clinton’s mistakes. The re-emergence of Clinton’s description of juvenile offenders as “super-predators” from her time as first lady and her refusal to sincerely apologize for it was a major misstep in the campaign, with many speculating that her pro-law and order record was ultimately related to the low turnout of black voters. Harris has similarly struggled to explain her past, or describe how her future approach might be different. This made her efforts to align herself with the demands of activists, by coming out in support of the decriminalization of sex work and other hot button issues, read more as opportunistic than sincere. Other candidates are faring better with the changing times. Elizabeth Warren has spoken of treating gun violence not solely as a policing issue but “as a public health issue”, a line that came straight out of the far left and has been used with increasing frequency among politicians, journalists and policymakers. Julián Castro has linked the violent and lethal acts of police with the larger issue of crime and violence in America, something that would have seemed unthinkable in the law and order days of a mere decade ago. None of the candidates have been declaring a need for more cops on the street, which used to be a standard line during debates in the last few decades. Of course, not every Democrat has embraced the shift in thinking and feeling around issues of criminal justice. Joe Biden is still using his work in getting the Violence Against Women Act passed as a sign of his tremendous feminist spirit, despite the fact that the VAWA is increasingly understood as being ineffectual at best and damaging at worst at addressing the problem of domestic and sexual violence. Pete Buttigieg is polling at 0% with black voters, possibly related to his blundering attempts to address the police violence scandals in South Bend. But neither candidate’s campaign has been so dependent on their approach to justice, and each has other strengths they can point to. Those remaining in the race should learn from Harris’s failure, and come up with plans to dismantle the prison industrial complex the Reagans, Bushes and Clintons worked so hard to build up. The tough-on-crime era is over, although society will be dealing with its aftermath for years to come."
118,crime,"I Love You, Now Die review – twisting truth behind a true-crime shocker","The pivot is key. In the genre of true-crime documentary that Netflix has dominated since Making a Murderer, the moment when the case dissolves from monochrome certainty – he did it! She did it! There is no way they didn’t do it! – into a grey tide of doubts that gradually recede to reveal the jagged rocks of deeper truth is what makes the form so watchable. You may feel that Netflix’s high-water mark, last year’s The Innocent Man, can’t be topped. It began with video footage of seemingly incontestable confessions by the two supposed perpetrators, plus detailed explanations from investigators of the crimes involved, before executing a remorseless deconstruction and debunking every moment that had gone before. But there appears to be a challenger to Netflix’s hegemony. A new channel, Sky Crime, has launched with I Love You, Now Die, a two-part HBO film that tells the extraordinary true story of two teenagers from Massachusetts, Michelle Carter and Conrad Roy. They met in 2012, and only a handful of times after that, but built a relationship via thousands of text messages over the next two years before Roy, who had depression during that time, took his own life on 12 July 2014. In the hours, days, weeks and months leading up to his suicide, he received a slew of messages from Carter, later found on his phone by police, offering advice on methodology, timing and general encouragement. “Are you gonna do it now?” “There’s a lot of ways.” “You keeping over thinking it … You just have to do it like you said.” She was indicted for involuntary manslaughter. It is an unhurried film. It gives time to Roy’s parents and extended family. It gives time to Roy, too, using footage he recorded of himself talking about his depression and feeling as if he were “wired wrong”. It gives us time to sit with the horror and feel the depth of grief. And then comes the pivot towards Carter and her story. What seems like a simple – horrific, but simple – case of psychopathy is rapidly complicated as the lens pulls back to take in the rest of the story. It restores context to the texts, which were shorn of it by the “black widow” media narrative that sprang up, and by the tight timeframe upon which the prosecutors focused at trial. We see, across the years and the thousands of messages, how desperately lonely and mentally fragile Carter was (she had been on antidepressants from a young age); how she tried for so long to support the young man she saw, or wanted to see (with little encouragement and often outright unkindness from him), as her boyfriend. We see how her inability to solve the problems of an 18-year-old who had already tried to take his own life four times melded with her desire to stay important to him, and led her to become the cheerleader for his most self-destructive impulses. In the end, argued the defence psychiatrist in court, she thought she was helping him. Along with the moral (and psychological and philosophical) issues raised by Carter’s behaviour that the film bears out – aided greatly by the eloquence and thoughtfulness of the journalist Jesse Barron, who covered the case – I Love You, Now Die also illuminates the more immediate side of the Carter trial. Somewhere in the storm of emotion was the legal matter of whether Carter, whatever ethical responsibility she bore, could or should be charged with manslaughter. In Massachusetts, encouraging a suicide is not a crime. How, then, could her words justify a manslaughter conviction? The judge found that they could – and did. So did an appeals court. Carter is halfway through the 15-month sentence that was handed down. She was denied parole last month. I Love You, Now Die is a superbly perceptive study of the endless convolutions and complexities of the human mind – and the proliferation of both when two people in a desperately unhappy state meet. It succeeds in raising questions – gently, but relentlessly – about our prejudices and our readiness to judge, as individuals and through our institutions, from the media to the courts. Without losing sight of anyone’s misery or loss, it forces nuance – a characteristic increasingly absent from discourse – into the discussion, for which we can only be grateful.

119,crime,Nova Scotia shooting: death toll rises to 22 as more victims identified,"Police in Canada have updated the death toll of the country’s worst mass shooting to 22, as more victims from the gun rampage in Nova Scotia were publicly identified. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) had previously warned the death toll would increase as investigators combed through several homes intentionally set ablaze by the gunman in a 12-hour rampage that started late on Saturday in the town of Portapique. On Tuesday, 16 separate crime scenes were being examined across the province.   map of attacks   The total number of deaths from the attack reached 23, including the gunman. The newly identified victims included a woman out for a walk, a care aide on duty, and a volunteer firefighter. Joey Webber, 36, had left his home on Sunday morning to buy furnace oil. When he didn’t return hours later, family fanned out to search for him – only to realize that he had last been seen close to the shooting.     Joey Webber was a keen outdoorsman. Photograph: Just Giving    Webber, a keen outdoorsman who was known for harvesting timber by horse, leaves behind his partner, Shanda MacLeod, and their two daughters, according to a crowdfunding page set up to help the family. The remains of Elizabeth Joanne Thomas and her husband, John Zahl, are believed to be still inside the burned-out two-storey log cabin, their grandson Justin Zahl told the Associated Press. Their home was next to that of the gunman, Gabriel Wortman, 51, and is thought to have been among the first properties to be attacked. Authorities have not identified a motive for the killings but said there was clear premeditation: Wortman wore a fake police uniform and decorated his car to look like an RCMP cruiser. As the attacks unfolded, police warned residents of the rural community to lock their doors and stay in their basements. Many people were already at home because of the coronavirus lockdown, but Lillian Hyslop had ventured out for a walk when she was shot dead. A neighbor, Debi Atkinson, told the Chronicle Herald that Hyslop’s encounter with the gunman appeared “100% random”. Authorities believe Wortman may have targeted his first victims but before attacking anyone on his path as he drove around. They included Gina Goulet, 54, who had almost fully recovered from a second diagnosis of brain cancer when she was killed, according to her daughter, Amelia Butler.     Gina Goulet, left, had almost fully recovered from a second brain cancer diagnosis. Photograph: Just Giving    Wortman died on Sunday after a standoff with police. The RCMP commissioner, Brenda Lucki, said Wortman was not well known to police and acted alone. She said police were still trying to determine what weapons had been used. Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday he had spoken with the family of Heidi Stevenson, an RCMP officer and mother of two who was killed in the attacks, and with another officer, Chad Morrison, who is recovering. The prime minister reiterated his calls for national unity, saying that all Canadians stood with the victims. “This week, we are all Nova Scotian,” he said."
120,crime,Article 15 review – no-holds-barred Indian crime thriller,"A bruising cop thriller set in Uttar Pradesh, Article 15 tackles two of the most contentious themes in Indian society: the caste system and the culture of violence against women. And – fair warning – it tackles them with a thunderous lack of sensitivity, particularly given that the film is loosely based on a real-life gang rape and murder case. That said, the anger that propels the picture towards violence is authentic and the official corruption and collusion depicted are all too real. Director Anubhav Sinha, who also co-wrote, has an eye for the kind of searing image that drives home a point. And Ayushmann Khurrana, playing the good cop who can’t bring himself to look away to preserve “society’s balance”, combines soulful Bollywood heartthrob charisma with an arrestingly intense performance."
121,crime,Stephen Colbert: 'We now have solid evidence of the crime Trump already confessed to',"Stephen Colbert: ‘If Pelosi wants to impeach you, I say: let her’ “It is important, I believe, to admit when you’re wrong,” said Stephen Colbert on the Late Show. “We talk a lot about how Donald Trump is this corrupt guy who deserves to be dragged out of his office kicking and screaming. But when I’m wrong, I’ll be sure to let you know.” It was not going to be Tuesday night, Colbert said, because that afternoon, America’s top diplomat to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, testified to Congress as part of the House’s impeachment inquiry. At particular issue was Trump’s 25 July phone call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy – one reported to Congress by a whistleblower – in which Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine if Zelenskiy didn’t promise to investigate Joe Biden, a political rival for Trump in 2020. Taylor’s testimony was “incredibly damaging to the president”, according to reports, with the opening statement said to have prompted gasps.              Taylor testified that release of aid to Ukraine was contingent on a public declaration to investigate the Bidens and the 2016 election. “Do you understand what this means?!” Colbert said. “We finally have solid evidence of the crime that Trump and his chief of staff have already confessed to committing on camera.”   Related: Colbert: Trump hosting G7 'not just unbelievable, it’s unconstitutional'    Taylor also testified that “everything” was contingent on the announcement of an investigation, including security assistance. “So Trump was holding everything hostage,” said Colbert, who then imitated the president on the phone: “Just make the announcement, Ukraine, and I’ll give you the White House trip, military aid to fight the Russians, and a beautiful new dinette set from Broyhill. And, if you act now, I’ll throw in this gently used constitution – I don’t really want it.’” To defend himself, Trump “went to his safe space: Fox News”, where he called the phone call a “letter” and lamented that “they don’t mention the letter any more.” “No, they don’t mention the letter any more, because it’s not a letter, it’s a phone call,” Colbert said. “But if Pelosi wants to impeach you over this, I say: let her.”              In a separate segment, Colbert welcomed guest John Lithgow to the show – dressed as Trump’s personal lawyer and cable news staple Rudy Giuliani. “Mr Mayor, how do you respond to critics who say you’re traveling the world pushing debunked conspiracies as part of a scheme to help the president’s re-election?” asked Colbert to Lithgow-as-Giuliani, complete with dentures and Giuliani’s characteristic bluster. “The 2016 election was not hacked by the Russians, it was hacked by Hunter Biden – who’s actually a Men in Black-style alien being operated by a tiny Hillary Clinton in his neck!” Lithgow said. Did he have any proof? “Oh, not yet, or ever!” Lithgow said. “I’m not falling into that proof trap.” Asked why he met with Rick Perry and Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, Lithgow responded as Scooby-Doo: “When you’re solving big, spooky mysteries you need a team. It was Gordon Sondland, Rick Perry, Velma and me, Rudy-Rudy-Rudy-Roo.” He then helped himself to a “Rudy snack” – a large glass of red wine. Finally, Colbert asked about former national security adviser John Bolton’s comment that Giuliani was a “hand grenade” that would blow everyone up. “Stephen, that’s crazy. Grenades are used by highly trained soldiers,” said Lithgow. “I’m more like a can of hairspray someone turns into a flamethrower during a prison riot.”"
122,crime,Proceder review – the life and crimes of a Polish rap star,"Like so many other biopics of musicians from the wrong side of the ring road, this dramatisation of the life of Polish rapper Tomasz Chada wants to find a redemptive moral in the morass of biographical material. The problem is, Chada’s storyline is thin on salvation, given he was an enthusiastic car thief (until prison slowed down his long career in crime), a committed consumer of drugs and alcohol, and an all round toerag to most of the people in his life, including the many women who tried to reform him, and the producer buddy who gave him a big break. Nevertheless, true to his inner good Catholic Polish boy child, he loved his mum and longed for her affection and approval – even though he sort of craps on her, too. He is played by Piotr Witkowski, whose feline eyes, eat-you-up grin and loping gait give Chada a charisma that helps you sort of see the appeal. His gritty raps about the mean streets of Warsaw and his life of crime – the usual fodder for hip-hop dirty realism the world over – are presumably sufficiently impressive in Polish to have won him an audience big enough to warrant this biopic in the first place. But it’s a rocky eight-kilometre road, and the bizarre narrative sleight of hand that the script pulls two thirds in feels like a convoluted way to pony up the redemption hit that audiences crave – one that maybaffle Chada fans who know what happened to their hero. • Proceder is released in the UK on 29 November.

124,crime,Mafia distributes food to Italy's struggling residents,"As Italy struggles to pull its economy through the coronavirus crisis, the Mafia is gaining local support by distributing free food to poor families in quarantine who have run out of cash, authorities have warned. In recent weeks, videos have surfaced of known Mafia gangs delivering essential goods to Italians hit hard by the coronavirus emergency across the poorest southern regions of Campania, Calabria, Sicily and Puglia, as tensions rise across the country. “For over a month, shops, cafés, restaurants and pubs have been closed,” Nicola Gratteri, antimafia investigator and head of the prosecutor’s office in Catanzaro, told the Guardian. “Millions of people work in the grey economy, which means that they haven’t received any income in more than a month and have no idea when they might return to work. The government is issuing so-called shopping vouchers to support people. If the state doesn’t step in soon to help these families, the mafia will provide its services, imposing their control over people’s lives.” The ramifications of the lockdown in Italy are affecting the estimated 3.3 million people in Italy who work off the books. Of those, more than 1 million live in the south, according to the most recent figures from CGIA Mestre, a Venice-based small business association. There have been reports of small shop owners being pressured to give food for free, while police are patrolling supermarkets in some areas to stop thefts. Videos of people in Sicily protesting against the government’s stalled response, or people beating their fists outside banks in Bari for a €50 (£44) loan are going viral and throwing fuel on the crisis; a fire the mafia is more than willing to stoke. From the first signals of mounting social unrest, the Italian minister of the interior, Luciana Lamorgese, said ‘‘the mafia could take advantage of the rising poverty, swooping in to recruit people to its organisation’’. Or simply stepping in to distribute free food parcels of pasta, water, flour and milk. In recent days, the police in Naples have intensified their presence in the poorest quarters of the city, where men tied to the Camorra, the Neapolitan mafia, have organised home delivery of food parcels. Magistrates have already begun an investigation against a group of people who were questioned while distributing food to local residents. In Palermo, according to La Repubblica, the brother of a Cosa Nostra boss allegedly distributed food to the poor in the Zen neighbourhood, an area with an established mafia presence. When the news broke, the man defended himself on Facebook, claiming that he was only doing charitable work and attacking the journalist who first reported the news. “Mafias are not just criminal organisations,’’ Federico Varese, professor of criminology at the University of Oxford, said. “They are organisations that aspire to govern territories and markets. Commentators often focus on the financial aspect of mafias but they tend to forget that their strength comes from having a local base from which to operate.” The question of distributing food parcels is a tactic as old as the mafia itself, where in the south of Italy bosses have customarily presented themselves to the people as benefactors and local power brokers, initially without asking for anything in return.  “Mafia bosses consider their cities as their own fiefdom,” Gratteri said. “The bosses know very well that in order to govern, they need to take care of the people in their territory. And they do it by exploiting the situation to their advantage. In the people’s eyes, a boss who knocks on the door offering free food is a hero. And the boss knows that he can then count on the support of these families when necessary, when, for example, the mafia sponsors a politician for election who will further their criminal interests.” Dozens of investigations in the south have led to the arrests of politicians who have aided and abetted the mafia, and who were elected with the support of local Mafiosi who forced citizens to vote for them in exchange for services, such as a simple food parcel. Varese said: “These handouts by the mafias are not gifts. The mafia does not do anything out of its kind heart. They are favours that everyone will have to pay back in some form or another, by aiding and abetting a fugitive, holding a gun, dealing drugs and the like.” “Consider what happened to El Chapo, the Mexican narco,” said Gratteri. “He trafficked tons of cocaine and commissioned the murder of hundreds of people but in his hometown he was known for his benevolence, because people said that he provided medicines to families or built roads. The same thing happens here.” This week, Itay’s antimafia prosecutor’s office said bosses would offer their virtually endless criminal capital to businesses in need, and then swallow them up. Then, they will use those businesses for money laundering profits from the criminal activities. Varese said: “The mafias might be able to benefit in other ways from the current lockdown and especially from the future, when Italians will all be able to return to work, spend more money, and get the economy on its feet again. But surely the story exemplified by the handouts of food parcels in Palermo and Naples shows their true nature, and it tells why they are so dangerous.”"
125,crime,Buttigieg slams Trump for considering war crime pardons,"Donald Trump’s willingness to consider pardons for US soldiers accused or convicted of war crimes “undermines the very foundations, legal and moral, of this country”, Democratic candidate for president Pete Buttigieg said.   Related: ‘The president's insane’: book by CNN's Jim Acosta charts Trump war on press    Amid reports that such pardons could come over the Memorial Day weekend, the president told reporters at the White House on Friday he was “looking” at the issue. “I haven’t done anything yet,” he said. “I haven’t made any decisions. There’s two or three of them right now. It’s a little bit controversial. It’s very possible that I’ll let the trials go on, and I’ll make my decision after the trial.” Trump is now in Japan. The Memorial Day holiday falls on Monday. Trump has already pardoned Michael Behenna, a soldier convicted in 2009 of killing a prisoner in Iraq. According to multiple reports, among cases now being considered is that of Edward Gallagher, a Navy Seal set for trial on charges of murdering a prisoner in Iraq and shooting unarmed civilians. Fox News hosts known to influence Trump have taken up Gallagher’s cause. It has also been reported that a lawyer who works for the Trump Organization has worked on the case. Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, spoke to ABC’s This Week in an interview broadcast on Sunday. He is a military veteran, having served in Afghanistan with the navy reserve. “Today,” he said, “one of the things that protects our troops morally and physically is the knowledge that if anybody in uniform does commit a crime, they will be held accountable by military justice. “For a president, especially a president who never served, to say he’s going to come in and overrule that system of military justice undermines the very foundations, legal and moral, of this country.” Buttigieg found a cautious ally in Joni Ernst, a Republican senator from Iowa who served in the national guard, deploying to Kuwait, and is a member of the armed services committee. She told CNN’s State of the Union she “would advise the president to be very careful”, because “it is not OK to perpetrate war crimes”. “We need our young men and women in uniform to understand that we operate under a code of ethics,” she said. Trump, Ernst said, should “scrutinise of course each case individually, and if it’s warranted, grant a pardon. If it is not, if someone has committed a war crime, then a sentence should be served.” Buttigieg, who has surged in the polls, has not been shy of attacking Trump. On Thursday, at an event hosted by the Washington Post, he discussed Trump’s own brush with military service. “I have a pretty dim view of his decision to use his privileged status to fake a disability in order to avoid serving in Vietnam,” he said. Trump received five draft deferments, four academic and one medical: bone spurs in a foot. The veracity of that claim has been extensively questioned. Buttigieg continued: “I mean, if he were a conscientious objector, I’d admire that, but this is somebody who, I think it is fairly obvious to most of us, took advantage of the fact that he was a child of a multimillionaire in order to pretend to be disabled so that somebody could go to war in his place.“I know that dredges up old wounds from a complicated time during a complicated war, but I am also old enough to remember when conservatives talked about character as something that mattered in the presidency, and so I think it deserves to be talked about.”   Related: Mike Pence tells US military graduates: you should expect to see combat    Buttigieg also discussed Vietnam in his ABC interview, in the context of remarks made by Trump about the treatment of soldiers accused of war crimes. At the White House on Friday, Trump told reporters: “Some of these soldiers are people that have fought hard and long. You know, we teach them how to be great fighters, and then when they fight, sometimes they get really treated very unfairly.” Buttigieg said: “The idea that being sent to war makes you a murderer is exactly the kind of thing that those of us who have served have been trying to beat back for more than a generation. “One of the reasons Vietnam war veterans were treated so horribly when they came home, at least some of them, was an attitude that found it very hard to separate policies from the people sent to carry out those policies.” He added: “When you serve, you are agreeing to serve the constitution and to uphold the law. And frankly [Trump’s] idea that being sent to fight makes you automatically into some sort of war criminal is a slander against veterans that could only come from someone who never served.”"
126,crime,Knife crime in England and Wales rises 8% over year,"Knife crime-related offences rose by 8% in England and Wales in the past year, government figures have shown. 
Between April 2018 and March 2019, police forces recorded 43,516 offences involving a knife or sharp instrument, in comparison with 40,215 in the year ending March 2018.

The increase, based on data from 43 police forces in England and Wales, excludes Greater Manchester police (GMP) due to the force’s undercounting of knife-related crimes in previous years. 
When crimes involving a knife or sharp instrument recorded by GMP over the past year are factored in, the figure for offences in England and Wales is 47,136 – the highest since records began. 
Of those incidents, 32% happened in London – where for every 100,000 people, there were 169 knife-related offences. 
Outside of the capital, the areas with the highest rates were Greater Manchester, the West Midlands and West Yorkshire, where there were 129, 118 and 116 knife-related offences per 100,000 people respectively. 
In recent weeks, the government has come under increased scrutiny over their tackling of Britain’s knife crime crisis after it extended controversial stop and search powers.

Assault with injury and assault with intent to cause serious harm accounted for 46% of offences involving a knife or sharp object, according to the Office for National Statistics. 
Robberies made up 18,462 or 42% of offences in the category – an increase of 10% from the previous year. 
Homicide, rape, attempted murder and sexual assault involving a knife or sharp instrument made up a small proportion of the figures in the year ending March 2019. 
The most prolific related offence was robbery involving a knife or sharp instrument –with 18,462 incidents recorded – up 10% from April 2017 to March 2018, when 16,732 incidents were recorded. 
Between April 2017 and March 2018, there were 40,215 offences recorded that involved a knife or sharp instrument – a 31% increase from the year ending March 2011 when 30,620 of the same kind of offences were recorded. 
 
  
  
   
    
    The Office of National Statistics (ONS) uses two main sources for their crime data statistical bulletins: the Crime Survey for England and Wales and the police recorded crime numbers.
    The Crime Survey for England and Wales is a face-to-face questionnaire. People are asked about their experiences of a selected range of offences in the 12 months prior to the interview. The ONS say this is the most reliable indicator for long-term trends, as it isn't subject to changes in the way that police forces monitor and record crime, and it will include people talking about experiences that weren't reported to the police.&nbsp;
    Police recorded crime is the number of notifiable crimes reported to and recorded by the police. The list of notifiable crimes is determined by the Home Office. The ONS say this data is more reliable for the recording of rarer crimes, like murder, and for crimes like theft, where people are often inclined to report a crime to the police as part of an insurance claim. This data cannot measure crimes not reported to the police because victims felt them too trivial, or where they may be reluctant to come forward to the police for personal reasons.
    
   
  
  
 
Nick Hurd, minister for policing and the fire service, said: “While the chances of being a victim of crime remain low, we are deeply concerned that certain offences, including serious violence, have increased and we are taking urgent action. 
“Police funding is increasing by more than £1bn this year, including council tax and £100 million for forces worst affected by violent crime.” 
Labour’s shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: “The Tories are losing the fight against violent crime, and their reckless cuts to the police and youth support are at the heart of the crisis. 
“All communities hit hard by rising crime will rightly be angry at the hypocrisy of Boris Johnson in demanding more police officers when he’s voted for every police cut since he entered office.”

127,crime,True crime author's claims to have interviewed serial killers contested,"Publishers of a true crime book by an “experienced criminal profiler” have pulled his work from sale, after his claims to have interviewed serial killers including Ted Bundy and Peter Sutcliffe were called into question. Described as “the master of the true crime genre” by Martina Cole, Paul Harrison is the author of more than 33 books, including his latest, Mind Games, issued by Urbane Publications in October 2018. The Doncaster author says he worked as a police officer in the UK for three decades, “serving as a dog handler, intelligence officer, as a detective and later as a profiler”, and that he “worked closely” with the FBI’s Behavioural Science Unit in Quantico, Virginia for six months in 1982. In interviews and at his live events, Harrison has claimed that Sutcliffe told him: “You seem completely indifferent to me. I’m scared of you.” He also claimed to have been present in the final days of Reggie Kray’s life and that he met American serial killers including Bundy and John Wayne Gacy. Harrison said Gacy had sent him paintings of clowns after tracking down his address, before his execution in 1994. Seven former FBI agents who were at Quantico when Harrison claims to have been there denied knowing who he was or that he would have interviewed Bundy and Gacy. The Kray twins’ former hitman Fred Foreman also said it was unlikely that Harrison would have been present at Kray’s deathbed. “Reggie would never have entertained police,” he said. Northants police confirmed Harrison had left the force in 1999, after working as an officer in Kettering. In a now deleted Facebook post, Harrison wrote: “This monster is no longer mine, nor is it what I wanted it to be. I saw it as a tool to give victims a voice, everywhere, but because I’m weak and vulnerable and utterly useless at decision making I was introduced into sensationalising events by promoters who often sent out misleading blurb. Something I had to live up to. I’ve decided to call it a day for now. No more shows or interaction on social media … It seems I’ve let everyone down, I’m sorry for that.” On Friday, Urbane Publications issued a statement: “Like everyone who worked with Paul Harrison, the attendees to his talks and the readers of his books, we are very concerned by these revelations and are currently seeking clarification before deciding what further action to take. However, with immediate effect we will be withdrawing Mind Games from sale and endeavouring to remove all stock and details from every relevant retail channel. We will also be donating any profits we have secured thus far from the sales of Mind Games to charities that help and support victims of violent crime.” On Saturday, a post on the Facebook Manchester Crime Club – co-founded by Harrison – announced it was “closing its doors with immediate effect for the foreseeable future” because “due to ongoing ill health, Paul has been advised by his doctors not to undertake any more events”."
128,crime,Monica Lewinsky to produce American Crime Story drama about Clinton scandal,"Monica Lewinsky is among the producers on a new series of American Crime Story focusing on the Bill Clinton sex scandal. Titled Impeachment: American Crime Story, the Ryan Murphy-helmed anthology drama will recount the notorious affair between the then US president Clinton and former White House intern Lewinsky, and the subsequent impeachment proceedings called against him by the US House of Representatives. Booksmart star Beanie Feldstein will star as Lewinsky, with Sarah Paulson playing Linda Tripp, the civil servant who secretly recorded phone calls the 22-year-old made about her affair with Clinton, who was 27 years her senior.   Related: Monica Lewinsky on Slow Burn: the thrilling hit podcast rips into the scandal    The series will premiere in September 2020 in the US, and is expected to air in the UK soon after. The previous two series of American Crime Story have been shown on BBC Two in the UK, as part of the broadcaster’s syndication deal with the US. Impeachment has been adapted by Murphy from Jeffrey Toobin’s book A Vast Conspiracy: The Real Sex Scandal That Nearly Brought Down a President. Murphy originally optioned the book in 2017, but shelved plans to bring it to TV last year as he felt that such a project would be “gross” without the contribution of Lewinsky. However, with Lewinsky’s involvement, Impeachment is now going ahead. In a statement to Vanity Fair, she said that she had been hesitant to sign on to the series, but was swayed by the opportunity to “reclaim my narrative”. “People have been co-opting and telling my part in this story for decades,” Lewinsky said. “In fact, it wasn’t until the past few years that I’ve been able to fully reclaim my narrative, almost 20 years later. “This isn’t just a me problem. Powerful people, often men, take advantage of those subordinate to them in myriad ways all the time. Many people will see this as such a story and for that reason, this narrative is one that is, regretfully, evergreen.” FX chairman John Landgraf said that the network would not be “reaching out” to Bill and Hillary Clinton for their input. The Clinton scandal has been the subject of renewed public interest in recent years, following the rise of the #MeToo movement and calls for the impeachment of current US president Donald Trump. Last year, Lewinsky contributed to docuseries The Clinton Affair, while the subject also formed the basis of the second season of popular current affairs podcast Slow Burn. American Crime Story has attracted critical acclaim and high ratings for its retellings of landmark events in recent US history. Its first season, 2016’s The People Vs OJ Simpson, won a total of nine Emmy awards for its account of the 1994 murder case against former American Football player and actor OJ Simpson. The drama went on to win a further three Emmys in 2018 for its second season, which recalled the 1997 murder of fashion designer Gianni Versace. A further series, about the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, had been in production but was scrapped by FX last year."
129,crime,Eric Cantona speech: humans 'will become eternal' – unless crime or war intervene,"Given previous form, perhaps it should be no surprise that Eric Cantona has again prompted bafflement with a philosophical monologue loosely based on football. The player-turned-actor elicited furrowed brows from the audience at the Champions League draw with a brief but wide-ranging speech that alluded to science, immortality and war. Channelling the spirit of 1995, the year he delivered his famous “when the seagulls follow the trawler” speech, the Frenchman kicked off with a quote from King Lear as he accepted the Uefa president’s award on stage at the ceremony in Monaco.   Related: Champions League draw: Liverpool drawn with Napoli, Spurs face Bayern    Members of the star-studded audience, which included Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, appeared dumbfounded as the former Manchester United forward went on to assert that that advancement of science was close to making humans immortal. “As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods, they kill us for their sport,” Cantona said, quoting King Lear. “Soon the science will not only be able to slow down the ageing of the cells, soon the science will fix the cells to the state and so we will become eternal. “Only accidents, crimes, wars, will still kill us but unfortunately, crimes, wars, will multiply. I love football.

130,crime,"87 bird crime incidents last year and just one conviction, says RSPB","Birds of prey were shot, poisoned, trapped or illegally killed in 87 confirmed incidents in 2018 that led to just one successful conviction, according to the RSPB’s annual Birdcrime report. This persecution of raptors including peregrines, buzzards, red kites and owls is the tip of the iceberg, with many more birds vanishing in mysterious circumstances, according to data from satellite-tagged birds and other intelligence. According to the report, 77% of the confirmed incidents took place in England. There were particular hotspots of illegal persecution in the Peak District, North Yorkshire and southern Scotland. Incidents were mostly recorded in upland areas where land is managed for driven grouse shooting. The RSPB is calling for an independent review of driven grouse shooting in England, alongside the licensing of all grouse moors across the UK, with a mechanism to withdraw licences if the illegal persecution of birds of prey is proved. Martin Harper, a conservation director at the RSPB, said: “Any industry which includes criminal and environmentally damaging practices needs reform. The driven grouse shooting industry has, despite decades of warnings, failed to put its house in order, most shockingly turning a blind eye to the ongoing illegal persecution of birds of prey. Given we face a climate and ecological emergency, we believe it is time for governments to intervene.” A petition by the wildlife campaigners Chris Packham, Mark Avery and Ruth Tingay calling for a ban on driven grouse shooting – in which large numbers of wild red grouse are driven towards waiting guns – has received 79,000 signatures. Hen harriers, a bird of prey almost extinct as a breeding bird in England because of its persecution on grouse moors, have this year enjoyed their best breeding season since monitoring began, with 15 nests in England producing 47 chicks. A 10-year study using Natural England data recently revealed that 72% of satellite-tagged hen harriers were confirmed or considered very likely to have been illegally killed. It found that hen harriers were 10 times more likely to disappear over grouse moors, where they are considered a threat to red grouse. Eleven of the English hen harrier nests this year are on land managed for grouse shooting. A new “brood management” scheme allows some chicks to be reared in captivity and released elsewhere to prevent concentrations of the bird on grouse moors."
131,crime,Giving Footsoldiers a bad name: why film title changes are the biggest crime of all,"Fans of the preposterous low-budget British crime saga Rise of the Footsoldier have plenty to worry about. There’s the series’ Rotten Tomatoes score, which has oscillated from a high of 88% to a horrible low of 23%. There’s the sad realisation that Shaun Ryder won’t be in any of the new films, after he was so memorably stabbed to death with a lightbulb in the last one. And now they have a name change to contend with. Next week’s fourth instalment had originally been titled Rise of the Footsoldier: Marbella. But now, in a last-minute reverse ferret, it is to be called Rise of the Footsoldier: The Spanish Heist. Why? Perhaps producers were worried the original title was too geographically specific, or that it didn’t explicitly promise dumb violence. Maybe this new one is just easier to pronounce.  But one thing is for certain. A name change of any kind is more often than not a bad thing. Look at what happened to Ford v Ferrari. That was a great title for a film. Two great car brands – one a workaday populist, the other an expensive status symbol – facing off against each other. You saw the title Ford v Ferrari and you knew exactly what the film was about. Except it isn’t called Ford vs Ferrari in the UK. Here it’s been changed to Le Mans 66, which is just about the worst title ever given to a film. It’s simultaneously more specific and more obscure, plus it ends with a number. You’ll remember that the play The Madness of George III was retitled as The Madness of King George when it was adapted for the screen, so as not to alienate people who might think it was the completion of a trilogy. The same could be said here. Why am I going to watch Le Mans 66 if I haven’t seen all first 65? Worse, will I have to do a French accent when I ask for a ticket? Because I don’t shop at Hotel Chocolat for exactly that reason.              This sort of thing infuriates me. When a film’s title is changed for the UK market, it dilutes its creative impact. The screenwriter wrote the film with a title in mind. It was produced and marketed everywhere else in the world with that title, but then it hits these shores with a new name and a slightly shoddier title sequence. Back in 1987, Harry and the Hendersons was Harry and the Hendersons until it came here, at which point it became Bigfoot and the Hendersons because apparently we’d have struggled to tell that it was a film about a Bigfoot, despite the poster having a giant bloody Bigfoot on it. Yes, I’m still sore. There are other examples. When it was theatrically released here, Bonnie and Clyde was given the unnecessarily explanatory title Bonnie and Clyde … Were Killers!  Battle: Los Angeles became World Invasion: Battle Los Angeles, because presumably British viewers wouldn’t care all that much if only Los Angeles was wiped off the map by an army of bloodthirsty aliens. I’m still furious about having to ask for a ticket to see Avengers Assemble, in case someone at the cinema got confused and accidentally ushered me into a screening of The Avengers, the 1998 Ralph Fiennes adaptation of a TV show about a man with a deadly umbrella. In fairness, it does work the other way. Ice Cold in Alex was marketed in the US as Desert Attack, which robs the film of all its charm. And Jason Statham’s 2013 film Hummingbird was retitled Redemption in the US, after a marketing executive realised that Americans only like films that sound like they’ve been coped from aspirational vinyl wall decals. But not every film that’s had its name messed about with is bad. Take Tom Cruise’s Edge of Tomorrow. It originally had the much better title All You Need Is Kill, after the book it was adapted from, before wimping out with an incredibly vague new name. It was so bad, in fact, that the name was changed again – to Live Die Repeat – for the DVD release. And it’s a great film, even though nobody really knows what it’s actually called any more. So Rise of the Footsoldier: The Spanish Heist needn’t worry. Just because it has a new name, it doesn’t mean that this new instalment won’t contain the same highly nuanced character work of the previous three Rise of the Footsoldier films."
132,crime,Australian jihadis: motivated by status and show no contrition for crimes,"The archetypal Australian jihadist has no apparent mental health issues, does not have a refugee background, and is more likely to have gone to a state school than a private Islamic one, according to one of the world’s largest databases of alleged and convicted terrorists. Islamist extremists from Australia tend to be better educated, more likely to be employed and have fewer and less serious criminal convictions than a typical European jihadist, according to the Lowy Institute study of 173 Australians alleged to have become foreign fighters or who have been convicted of terrorism offences. But they are still more likely to be on welfare or do blue-collar work than the average Australian, suggesting that a desire for personal status may be a greater motivator for joining or supporting a terrorist group than religious devotion, poverty or mental health issues – causes that are popularly cited as driving factors.   Related: Australia says it won't risk more lives trying to rescue citizens from northern Syria    The Typology of Terror working paper, by the Lowy Institute fellow Rodger Shanahan, studied the backgrounds and characteristics of 173 Australian citizens and residents who are known to have joined radical Islamist terrorist organisations or who have been charged with terrorism offences. It challenges a number of the stereotypes ascribed to those attracted to jihad. The Australia jihadi cohort skews strongly male – 85% to 15% – and is young, on average, aged 25. Those from Sydney or Melbourne, and from a handful of suburbs within those two cities, account for 90% of the cohort. In Sydney, they lived in the western suburbs, and in Melbourne, there were two distinct northern and southern groups, close to religious institutions. Jihadists are most likely to have attended a state school, and have completed Year 12. “Twenty seven per cent had not completed high school, almost exactly the rate for the rest of Australia. Of the high schools they attended, 73% were state high schools (slightly higher than the national average of 66%), 17% private Islamic schools and 6% non-Islamic private schools.” Most jihadists held down jobs before leaving Australia or committing their crime, but their unemployment rate was greater than the national rate (17% to 6%) and they were more than twice as likely to work in blue-collar jobs compared with the general population. The paper argues that the attraction of Islamic State or other terrorist organisation “may… have been influenced by a desire to increase personal status”. “Occupying for the most part lower status roles in secular Australian society, Australian jihadis may have been attracted to the empowerment and high religious status Islamic State offers martyrs…”   Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning        The working paper concedes establishing the impact of mental health on jihad is difficult, and contentious, but the working paper found there was little link between established mental health issues and the commission of terror offences. Only two people in Australia – Ihsas Khan, who attacked another man with a knife in Sydney’s western suburbs, and Moudasser Taleb, who attempted to travel to Syria to join Islamic State – have pleaded mental impairment in defence of a terrorism charge. A judge accepted Khan suffered mental health issues, but found those did not have a causal effect on the offence, while Taleb’s claim was accepted, a judge ruling his mental illness “significant impact on his moral culpability”. Australians convicted of terror offences tend to show little contrition for their acts, and have, on the whole, poor chances for rehabilitation, the paper argues. Nearly three-quarters (73.8%) of those convicted displayed no contrition, while fewer than one in 10 (9.5%) displayed ‘genuine contrition’. Forty per cent were found by judges to have poor or non-existent prospects for rehabilitation. There is no correlation between a refugee background and jihadism: just 6% of the Australian jihadi cohort have a first- or second-generation refugee background. Typology of Terror found many of the characteristics of Australian jihadis matched those from comparable democracies overseas such as the US, and in Europe. But in other ways, Australia differed significantly.   Related: Dutton’s citizenship-stripping laws may increase risk of terrorism, Asio warns    Australia has far fewer converts to Islam joining terrorist causes. In Europe and the US, converts to the religion make up about 20% of extremist fighters, in Australia, the figure is 8%. Also, the correlation between criminality and jihadism is weak among the Australian cohort. Studies in Germany, France, the UK and the Netherlands showed a strong link between serious criminal histories and jihad. “Almost 90% of the Australian terrorists in the data set have either no or minor police records. The ‘jihadi in pursuit of salvation’ argument therefore holds little weight.” Shanahan said the working paper provided a snapshot of the Australian jihadi cohort, beyond the cliched image of the disaffected, impressionable young man. Australia needed to continue not only to deal with those convicted of terrorist crimes, but also to detect those at risk of being radicalised and offending. “You can deal with it in terms of legislation, which the Australian government has done: if you don’t display contrition, if it’s deemed you don’t have a good chance of rehabilitation, the Australian government has interim control orders, extended detention orders: legislatively, the steps are there to deal with people who come out of jail. “But that’s after someone has committed an offence: we keep coming back to this question of ‘who are the influencers?’. Most of these people don’t wake up one day and say ‘I’m going to become a terrorist’, there’s a normalising of language and ideas, and this is something that community leaders need to address – and in public not in private. We know that it’s not criminality [driving attraction to jihad], it’s not mental health, it’s the attraction of a part of the religion that is spread by Australian and foreign speakers and writers.”"
133,crime,US imposes sanctions on Sri Lankan army chief over war crimes,"The US has imposed sanctions on Sri Lanka’s chief of army staff, Lt Gen Shavendra Silva, for war crimes committed at final stages of the conflict against the Tamil Tigers in 2009, when up to 70,000 Tamil civilians were killed.   Related: Trump responds to Barr: I have 'legal right' to intervene in criminal cases – live    The US travel ban against Silva and his family marks the first time any of the leading suspects in the mass killings have been held accountable on the world stage. The sanctions come three months after the election of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the defence secretary during the brutal counter-insurgency. His victory increased fears there would be a return to impunity for war crimes, and a creeping erosion of human rights protections. During the 2008-09 conflict, General Silva was the commander of the army’s 58th division, which was accused of shelling “no-fire zones” where ten of thousands of civilians had been told by the government to take shelter as it mounted a final offensive. Hundreds of Tamil Tiger fighters also disappeared after surrendering to Silva’s troops. His promotion to army chief in January 2019 triggered widespread outrage. Frances Harrison, the programme coordinator of the International Truth and Justice Project, which advocates for accountability for mass crimes in Sri Lanka, said: “How on earth did the government of Sri Lanka think it would not have consequences when they appointed one of the most notorious commanders to head the army? “Shavendra Silva’s promotion to army commander and acting chief of defence showed utter disdain for international law and disrespect to victims of the civil war.” Harrison, the author of Still Counting the Dead: Survivors of Sri Lanka’s Hidden War, said: “Eyewitnesses say he was present at the surrender of hundreds of Tamils on the last day of the war who have subsequently disappeared in army custody – for years those mothers have been sitting in the hot sun in the roadside holding up photos of their children desperate to know what happened. “This is not justice. It’s humiliation.” The state department designation holds him accountable, through command responsibility for “in gross violations of human rights, namely extrajudicial killings, by the 58th division of the Sri Lanka army during the final phase of Sri Lanka’s civil war in 2009”. Sri Lanka has ignored UN human rights council resolutions it signed agreeing to establish a system to hold to account the perpetrators of mass killings. Since Silva became head of the army and Rajapaksa was elected president, victims’ families and witnesses have been under pressure to withdraw their testimony, according to Meenakshi Ganguly, the South Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “After that, families of the disappeared, have been receiving threats from security forces asking them to withdraw their protests, and their complaints,” Ganguly said. “They have been getting calls from the intelligence agencies asking about their meetings and plans.” In a statement accompanying the sanctions announcement, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said: “We urge the Sri Lankan government to promote human rights, hold accountable individuals responsible for war crimes and human rights violations, advance security sector reform, and uphold its other commitments to pursue justice and reconciliation.”"
134,crime,Video of trans women forced from LA bar prompts hate crime investigation,"Security at a Los Angeles bar physically removed a group of transgender women after they were harassed and attacked by a straight couple, according to video and the women’s accounts of the incident, which is being investigated as a hate crime. 
Las Perlas, a popular downtown LA bar, is now facing calls for a boycott after footage went viral over the weekend, showing its security staff grabbing multiple trans women and forcefully dragging them outside. The women said they were violently thrown out Friday night after a couple inside the bar yelled slurs at them and physically attacked them.  
“It’s been so traumatizing,” Jennifer Bianchi, one of the women whose removal was caught on camera, told the Guardian on Monday. “I feel it was an assault, and it was a violation of my human rights.” 
Police have since opened a hate crime investigation. 
 
  
 
The controversy comes amid reports of increasing anti-LGBTQ hate crimes across the US, escalating concerns about the murders of trans women, and numerous efforts by the Trump administration to allow businesses to discriminate against trans and queer people. 
A group of trans women, gay men and a non-binary person went to the bar together on Friday night after the DTLA Proud Festival, an event celebrating the LGBTQ community in downtown. At some point, a straight couple started harassing the women by repeatedly calling them men, said Bianchi, who was at Las Perlas with her colleagues from Bienestar, a social services organization. 
“They said we don’t belong there. They said we were men with wigs. They called us a lot of terrible stuff,” said Khloe Rios, Bienestar’s manager for the transgender program and services. She said they tried to ignore the harassment, but then the man got close to them and ultimately slapped her friend. “We tried to protect her.” 
Instead of trying to shield the women from the abuse, the bar’s security then decided to throw out the entire group of eight LGBTQ people, as well as the couple, the women said, adding that the security were particularly aggressive with the trans women. 
 Rios’ cellphone footage captured one security guard putting his arms around Bianchi as she said, “Don’t touch me like that! I need my shoe.” The guard was then seen shoving her and wrapping his arms around her, before forcing her toward the door. 
The video also captured a guard grabbing another woman in the group, putting his arms around her neck and forcing her out, as she said, “What happened?” The guard pushed her out of the bar while appearing to hold her by her head. 
“They started throwing us against the wall, dragging us across the bar and being violent to us,” said Rios, adding of the couple: “They didn’t use any force for them.” 
Rios said she stopped filming as she was dragged out.

By removing the women, the security had also put them in greater danger, Bianchi said, noting that the man who had harassed them became more violent outside of the bar, grabbing a piece of metal on the sidewalk and threatening to murder them. 
“He was violent. Why would they kick us outside? They were putting our lives at risk,” she said. 
The man, who has not been identified, continued to shout slurs outside, she recalled. “He said he was going to come back and shoot us all.” 
Cedd Moses, the CEO of Pouring With Heart, the company that owns Las Perlas, defended the bar’s treatment of the women, saying in a statement: “Our manager on duty asked both groups to leave as the safety and security of our patrons and employees is our top priority and we have zero tolerance for this type of behavior ... The guards removed the guests that were not compliant with the manager’s request to leave and did so in accordance with company policy.” 
He said Las Perlas would donate profits from the weekend to Bienestar. 
In a subsequent statement on Facebook, the bar apologized to the trans community and said it was hiring a new security company “that has received sensitivity training” and has hired outside counsel to review the incident. 
Rios said the bar’s response was inadequate and that the incident brought back past trauma.

“Every single day, I see cases of trans women being discriminated, being bullied or being killed,” she said, noting that the bar left the women in a vulnerable situation where they could have been killed. “We could be having a vigil right now. I could’ve been number 17 for trans women killed this year.” (At least 16 trans people have been killed in the US in 2019 so far, mostly trans women of color.) 
Rios said she was trying to stay strong as an advocate and use the experience to push for reforms, such as stronger anti-discrimination policies and better training at bars across LA. 
The women filed a hate crime report with the Los Angeles police department (LAPD), and police said in a statement it would “thoroughly investigate the incident”, adding, “Whether in public, or inside of a private establishment, all Angelenos deserve the freedom to coexist in harmony.” 
Bianchi, who works as a health educator and case manager, said this type of discrimination and abuse is common, and that people are paying attention to this case because they were a group of activists and not-for-profit workers with a platform. 
“We deserve the same respect and treatment that everybody deserves,” she said. “We have fought for our rights for decades to be free.” 
Bianchi said she was still struggling to process what had happened. “I have to get up and put on my makeup and just be strong … but I’ve been feeling like I’m still in shock and still in disbelief. I’m emotional.” 
She added that it was hard for some of them to even speak about what happened: “This was humiliating for all of us.”"
135,crime,'Trust your dog': extraordinary pets help solve crimes by finding bodies,"Rob Ward keeps baby wipes, canned soup, and bottled water in his truck. “If I need a bath or a meal, there it is,” he explained in a Walker, Louisiana Waffle House. Calls can come at anytime, and his truck remains loaded, his bag packed. Today is a rare day off from both of his jobs: a nine to five at a printing company and volunteer work looking for dead bodies with his Australian shepherd, Niko. Ward and Niko are one of approximately 500 volunteer cadaver dog-handler pairs across the country who assist law enforcement in recovering human remains. Ward remembers a call a few years back: a missing female, suspected homicide. He put 1,500 miles on his truck over the course of a month searching for her, but they found nothing. Then, on a scorching day in a wooded field, the humidity weighing on Ward and 15 law enforcement officers, Niko started running. After a few yards, he abruptly sat down. He had found part of a pelvis and a leg, all bone, unburied. Soon they found most of a full skeleton. “That one has stayed with me for some reason. I knew the victim’s name,” Ward said. “You take the emotions, and you set it aside, because you’ve got a job to do. You deal with the grief, or the anger, afterwards.”     Lisa Higgins addresses other members of the Louisiana Search and Rescue Dog Team before the group’s training session. Photograph: William Widmer/The Guardian    Even big counties usually don’t have enough annual missing persons to justify the time and expense it takes for police to train a cadaver dog. Therefore, the majority of cadaver dog teams nationwide are volunteers. They are doctors, teachers and stay-at-home moms, and their dogs. A dog’s sense of smell is stronger than a human’s by orders of magnitude. One police officer gave this metaphor: if you walk into a house where someone is cooking gumbo, you can smell that immediately. But a dog smells the garlic, chopped onions, and each kind of fish going into the pot. Death, much like gumbo, emits a bouquet of smells. One scientific study found cadaver dogs were approximately 97% accurate overall in picking out a square of carpet that had been contaminated with the smell of a human corpse.    You take the emotions, and you set it aside, because you’ve got a job to do. You deal with the grief, or the anger, afterwards    Any dog breed can be used, though classic working breeds such as labradors or shepherds are common. Any person (excluding those with a criminal background) can become a handler, but many don’t get through the grueling training. The teams that do achieve certification become a rare few civilians allowed to participate in criminal investigations, including murders, kidnappings and serial crimes. Why the handlers volunteer – and why police let them – tests the boundaries of community service and law enforcement.   interactive   St Tammany parish in south-eastern Louisiana is peppered by swimming holes, lakes, rivers, creeks and bayous. Live oaks, Spanish moss and various wildlife flourish along the waterways within St Tammany. With over 200,000 residents and 279 square miles of navigable water, drownings and boat accidents are frequent. Logjams can clog the rivers; strong currents challenge even experienced divers, and the swamps and bayous are home to a handful of alligators (although shrimp can sometimes eat a dead body faster). In the late 90s, this parish led the state in drowning deaths, but that number is down to two or three a year now, according to local police. The St Tammany sheriff’s office has its own K-9s for apprehension, narcotics detection, and tracking, but they do not train cadaver dogs. For 18 of his 23 years as a police officer, Deputy Chance Wood, 43, has served in the marine unit, rescuing people in distress and recovering the remains of those who have drowned, often with the help of cadaver dogs. “I’ve made more recoveries than I care to count, but I’ve helped more people than I had to recover,” he said.     Chance Wood steers handler Kirsten Watson and her one-year-old dog, Quest. Photograph: William Widmer/The Guardian    One of the recoveries that a cadaver dog team assisted with back in 2015 was the body of a young mother. While boating with her three kids, the engine failed, sending them over a dam. Two of the children were saved by a nearby teenager; the third child spent almost an hour in an air pocket underneath the boat but survived. The mother, then 31 years old, drowned. She was Wood’s sister. Wood uses the same word the local cadaver dog handlers use when talking about their work: service. Wood has never told the local dog team the story about his sister. Instead, he expresses his gratitude through service: even on some of his days off, he pilots a boat for team training. “It amazes me, the dedication and just the drive,” he said of the volunteer teams. On a sunny Saturday in January, a group of dog handlers arrive at 9am near the 36,000-acre Bogue Chitto refuge. The handlers come from New Orleans, Walker and as far as the Baton Rouge area. They swap homemade cookies and talk about their vacations. Out of the cracked windows of their parked cars, nearly a dozen dogs bark in excitement. Every Saturday, regardless of the weather, the team trains around Louisiana, sometimes from sunup to sundown. The newest member is Kirsten Watson, a petite woman in her 40s who somehow manages to control her 77lb German shepherd. She has been training for about a year, while some of the veteran handlers have decades of experience.     Ann Dugas and her nine-year-old dog Sundance after a water search exercise. Photograph: William Widmer/The Guardian    James Todd, whom the team calls “Doc”, is an orthopedist who could no longer perform surgery after a hunting accident blinded him in one eye, but he’s been able to use his medical skills in the field – he once administered first aid on an Alzheimer’s patient they located who had been presumed dead. Pat Brown worked with dogs as a New Orleans police officer; when he retired, he found it hard to enjoy the free time. “I was bored, aggravating my wife. So she went and bought a dog and said ‘find something to do,’” he said. Ann Dugas works part-time for Toyota, when she isn’t out with one of her six working dogs. Wood is here, too, piloting the boat on the Pearl River canal. Later this afternoon, Wood will take teams on the water, the dogs’ paws clenching the edges, until they pick up on the smell from an underwater air canister scented with human remains. The dogs learn to alert on the water based on odor that comes through air bubbles (dead bodies emit gases that gurgle to the surface). Lisa Higgins starts herding the dogs and their handlers toward the first exercise: a speed drill with autopsy rags. Higgins, whom everyone calls “Miss Lisa”, founded the Louisiana Search and Rescue Team (LaSAR) 30 years ago and has responded to upwards of 400 searches. She’s the team trainer now, and her manner of answering questions and gently correcting the handlers brings to mind the patience of a school teacher. She was the first female mounted police officer in Pearl River in 1978. Seeing a need for the dogs in her search and rescue work with the police, she started a volunteer cadaver dog team with her daughter.

Both dogs are trained to detect human remains. Right: Pat Brown kneels next to his three year-old dog Charlie. Brown has trained Charlie to detect human remains, and his sister Adain to specialize in “live hunts.”   As she opens a plastic case of training materials, the smell of death becomes obvious. This team trains on bones, blood, teeth, skin, placenta, autopsy rags and blood-smeared weapons, much of which comes from donations to science. The bones are on loan from a professor who worked with Higgins on a five-year study about cadaver dogs. Access to materials like bones or flesh are restricted in most states, and handlers have to prove their credentials. In Tennessee or North Carolina there are “body farms” to train dogs on full corpses. Tails are wagging and the dogs pull on their leashes. On one drill, the dogs must find a container of gauze stained with human blood, hidden a few hundred yards into the woods. When the handlers say “seek” or “go find it,” the dogs take off, running in wide circles, with their handler traipsing in the woods behind them. The only sounds during the drill are leaves crunching, the dog’s deep breathing trying to smell everything around her, and Lisa’s quiet corrections to the handler. “Talk less,” she’ll say. “Trust your dog.” All but the most stubborn handlers respond with “Yes ma’am.” The dogs are trained to keep looking until they’re not just close but inches away – and that’s when Messi barks. She found the gauze, hidden in a rotting tree stump.     A glass jar filled with an ‘odor sample’ – in this case a rag soaked in bodily fluid – that Lisa Higgins uses in training courses for the Louisiana Search and Rescue Dog Team. Photograph: William Widmer/The Guardian    After a cadaver dog is fully trained – which can take as long as two years – they are meant to have the intelligence of a seven-year-old child. They understand dozens of words and find human remains across a variety of environments. Law enforcement recognizes about half a dozen different certifications, but no single entity regulates the teams. Dogs respond to their handlers’ emotions, which is why the handlers must show only joy when their dog finds something. That’s not always easy, especially when it comes to murder, dismemberment or the death of children. Ann Dugas has been doing this work for more than 20 years, and she can usually compartmentalize. Tears came to her eyes as she described finding a 14-year-old drowning victim more than a decade ago, at a time when she had a child the same age. After her dog indicated his location and police took over to pull the body up, she walked down the road and cried.   interactive   Higgins’s first find nearly 30 years ago was a drowning victim lodged four feet under water and three feet under sand. Now 66, with salt-and-pepper hair, Higgins seems used to being underestimated. She’s not one to brag, so it took a few days of being on the trail with her to learn about the serial killers she’s helped put away, as well as her frequent collaborations with the FBI. About 10 years ago, she flew to Alaska for a murder case. Little did she know at the time, but the serial killer, Joshua Wade, watched as she and police searched his house. Higgins’s dog was able to indicate the exact clothing Wade was wearing when he was in close proximity to the remains of a neighbor he shot, execution-style in the head. Wade has since admitted to four other murders and is serving a life sentence.    'Talk less,' she’ll say. 'Trust your dog.'    Many handlers and experts are women. During searches in the 1990s, Higgins encountered resistance from the male-dominated world of law enforcement. One diver said he wouldn’t jump in the water because “some lady’s dog said so”. Gesturing around us, she said: “You’re in the south. They did not want women.” She added, laughing, “but it was their mistake”. That reluctance has changed, in part because of national tragedies in which cadaver dogs were used, such as 9/11, Hurricane Katrina and California wildfires.     Snow, a search dog specializing in the location of human remains, locates a sample that the team hid in the woods of rural St Tammany parish. Photograph: William Widmer/The Guardian    Higgins describes Kirsten Watson, the newcomer, as having the perfect combination of talent and drive. Watson, a former animal control officer, recently started training her first cadaver dog, a German shepherd named Quest. After a break for lunch at a roadside barbecue called Hog Heaven, the trainers drove to a second site further up the canal, looking for one of six training burials scattered near the Pearl River. As the sun started to set, Watson climbed a wooded hill with Quest, as Higgins watched a few yards behind. Watson grew frustrated after Quest found the scent and then dropped it, his boundless puppy energy momentarily taking over. Higgins gave minor corrections but reassured Watson that both she and Quest were on the right track. Watson has a personal stake in this work: in 2015, her father disappeared. He has never been found. Many of the cases these handlers work went cold years before. In a city like New Orleans where police have heavy caseloads, the cold trail of a missing person is not a top priority. That’s where teams like this one come in, following up leads on the weekends, even just to rule something out. “They need to come home too,” she said of those missing people. “Many times, these people that we’re looking for were discarded like trash – and being able to bring them home to their families – someone’s got to do it.”"
136,crime,The message is clear: give ex-prisoners a job to stop them returning to crime,"I first entered the penal system in England in 1957. Then, over the next four decades, I was in and out of prison and endured it with as much good grace as possible. For the last 16 years, I have written about the system that incarcerated me, and I watch films, documentaries, indeed, any performance that promises to depict jail life as it is and offers lessons in how to improve it for prisoners and the public. More often than not, I am disappointed. But occasionally, I find a nugget like Second Chance, a film by Rex Bloomstein, who has form for reporting accurately and powerfully on the criminal justice system in this country. It features jails and prisoners but, at a time when the prison system is in meltdown and reformers in despair, it offers a glimpse of hope and inspiration and, above all, shows what can and should be done if we are to make headway in the battle against reoffending. This is a fight we are clearly losing. No amount of tough talk by Boris Johnson or his home secretary, Priti Patel, designed to win over Brexit party supporters in the run-up to an election will reduce reoffending, which costs taxpayers about £15bn a year. More than half of all adults leaving prison are reconvicted within a year of discharge. Two-thirds of those had failed to find work on release.   Related: ‘I earn less than I did growing cannabis, but I have peace of mind’    Can we claim surprise at these figures? Without a job, or home in many cases, and a discharge grant of £46, – unchanged since 1995 – where else can most ex-cons drift back to, but crime? Most of those who find work do not reoffend, yet many employers are reluctant to take a chance with former prisoners. Second Chance follows the fortunes of six people who were convicted and jailed for criminal offences: four former prisoners in work and two hoping to join them. They are the products of a bold scheme that has achieved staggering success rates since it began. James Timpson, who runs the family-owned shoe-repair and key-cutting chain, says he has employed 1,500 ex-prisoners in his shops since launching the venture and just four have gone back to prison. I repeat that: four out of 1,500. These are figures to die for even for those forward-thinking Scandinavian countries. These are not northern European success rates, they are utopian super-statistics. Timpson realised there was a wealth of talent behind bars, so in 2008, he opened a training academy at HMP Liverpool. The Timpson group, which also owns the dry cleaners Johnsons, and Snappy Snaps and Max Spielmann photo shops, now has workshops in seven prisons, along with a Max Spielmann academy in New Hall prison, west Yorkshire. And there are plans in place to roll out the scheme across all the outlets in the group, including the dry-cleaning chain. You could be forgiven for thinking Second Chance is merely great PR for the company. But Timpson says the staff he recruits from prison are among the most loyal and honest of all his employees. It takes some bottle to tell your half a million customers, whose shoes you repair, keys you cut and photos you process each week, that you recruit from prisons. This absorbing film sends the message out – quietly but clearly. The prime minister would do well to listen. • Eric Allison is the Guardian’s prison correspondent"
137,crime,The Catholic School by Edoardo Albinati review – violent crime without the drama,"Winner of the Strega prize, Italy’s equivalent of the Booker, The Catholic School turns on a notorious crime that took place in an Italian seaside town in 1975, when three well-to-do young men from Rome abducted, raped and tortured two teenage girls, killing one, in a case that provoked a wave of horrified soul-searching, not least among the middle classes. Edoardo Albinati’s novel is a mammoth, roundabout attempt to conjure with the fact that he went to the same boarding school as the perpetrators, analysing – over more than 1,200 pages – the environment that formed them, from the political terrorism of Italy’s “years of lead” (the criminals were neo-fascists) to the post-60s upending of social and sexual norms that left bourgeois families like Albinati’s at sea. The result resembles a true crime novel as told by Karl Ove Knausgaard. “What can explain the fact that yesterday I spent at least an hour online searching for photos of a skinny Belgian model with big tits? Why does sexual freedom so closely resemble slavery?” Albinati asks in lines typical of his candid self-portraiture and abstract musing. “Sex is a singular sort of prison whose bars keep you from getting in, rather than getting out,” he writes: “what you want, what you desire is inside”.    Nine-hundred pages in, Albinati tells “anyone who has had enough” to skip nearly half of what’s left    An endnote from Albinati’s translator, Antony Shugaar, suggests the specificity of his cultural references may deter non-Italians. Maybe, but fiction can thrive on detail and The Catholic School is full of gusty generalisation: its challenge might actually be its lack of specificity. While you can see why Albinati avoids lingering on the criminals at the narrative’s heart, his deliberately anti-novelistic style, lacking any characters or story to speak of, makes it hard to buy his idea that their actions represented some kind of “reprisal in the larger context of a global war” triggered by feminism – an idea that, undramatised, seems little more than a strenuous bid to intellectualise violent misogyny. This isn’t a normal novel, and nor is the pact it makes with the reader; 900 pages in, Albinati tells “anyone who has had enough” to skip nearly half of what’s left. Ignore that advice and the reward is moot: late passages involve, among other things, a dream Albinati has about taking revenge on dog owners who let their pets foul the pavement and some needy emails from an ex-classmate failing to muster numbers for a school reunion. Yet, weirdly, it’s in these drifting tides of consciousness, rather than the book’s quasi-anthropological grandstanding, that Albinati’s titanic enterprise ultimately feels most alive, even if what they tend to reveal – men think about sex; sometimes it’s ugly – isn’t exactly news. • The Catholic School by Edoardo Albinati (translated by Antony Shugaar) is published by Picador (£22).

138,crime,Hardliner Priti Patel is the wrong person to tackle knife crime,"Priti Patel is being hailed as the “hardest line home secretary for years”. Her fan club expects a tough, criminal justice-led approach that will reclaim the Conservatives’ reputation as the party of law and order. If so, she will be the wrong home secretary to tackle the surge in youth violence. The hard right are looking forward to a return to the tried-and-failed approach of searching, arresting and imprisoning our way out of trouble, but the evidence points to the need for prevention and early intervention by a range of state agencies. In the year to March 2019, police forces in England and Wales recorded more than 47,000 offences involving knives, up 8% on the previous year and the highest total since records began. In the year to March 2018, 285 people in England and Wales were stabbed to death. The number of juvenile offenders convicted or cautioned for knife offences has increased by 48% in four years. Figures from eight of the largest police forces reveal that stop and search has more than doubled in two years. In the first nine weeks of 2019, 10 teenagers were stabbed to death.   Related: Action on rise in youth violence completely inadequate, say MPs    Against this blood-soaked backdrop, the cross-party home affairs select committee has published its report on serious youth violence. This wide-ranging and thoughtful analysis describes the recent rises in youth violence as a social emergency, requiring concerted state action at local, regional and national level. It dismisses the government’s serious violence strategy – almost devoid of clear actions, targets and accountability – as “completely inadequate”. Key recommendations include agencies working together to help safeguard children from risks outside the home, such as exploitation by county lines gangs, increasing the confidence of young people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds in the police, and providing dedicated police support to schools in high-risk areas. Crucially, the MPs highlight the strong evidence linking deprivation and vulnerability with knife crime and serious youth violence. They argue that the current surge has been exacerbated by a “perfect storm” of cuts to youth services and policing, growing numbers of children excluded from school and taken into care, and a failure of statutory agencies to keep young people safe. It talks about youth outreach workers and community projects co-designed with local young people. It highlights the importance of giving young people safe places to go, and demands urgent action to tackle school exclusions and shortcomings in pupil referral units. Crashing into this complex latticework of causes and solutions is the new standard bearer for the right, Patel. Her supporters are slavering at the prospect of finally purging the memory of Theresa May restricting the use of stop and search, confidently predicting Patel will “win the war on crime”. They want to see the home secretary come down hard on recreational cannabis use, ramp up stop and search, give longer sentences – to arrest our way out of the problem. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, told the first meeting of the new national policing board that the answer to the surge in violent crime is “strong, visible policing”.   Related: Sign up for Society Weekly: our newsletter for public service professionals    If Patel’s approach to tackling youth violence is to pursue these simplistic policies, she will fail to get a grip on the problem long-term. For example, while appropriate use of stop and search has its place, Home Office research and analysis by the College of Policing demonstrate that targeted weapons searches in London have had little, if any, impact on overall crime rates. New York City police used stop-and-frisk 686,000 times in 2011. Since then, the tactic has been all but abandoned while crime has dropped sharply. That does not prove that ending stop and search would cut violent youth crime, but it is surely convincing evidence that simply ramping up searches will not solve the problem. From the US to Glasgow, there is powerful evidence that tackling youth violence requires a concerted, sustained effort to address the root causes, alongside effective policing. Patel will fail if she does not accept this reality. • Richard Vize is a public policy commentator and analyst"
139,crime,'There's not enough police': East London volunteers take on knife crime,"A DIY knife amnesty bin has been set up by residents in east London in response to rising violence. 
Since it launched in May, volunteers from Binning Knives Saves Lives have collected 140 knives in Waltham Forest. 
Courtney Barrett, who started the initiative, said he had been motivated by rising levels of knife crime close to his home in Leytonstone. 
“When people ask me if I’ve been personally affected, I feel like I have,” said Barrett, 45. “There’s not enough police nowadays – we have to start fending for ourselves.” 
About 25 volunteers help to run the makeshift amnesty using a repurposed domestic wheelie bin. They also offer information to young people about nearby youth groups. 
Since 4 May, they have been campaigning once a week or once fortnightly, depending on funding levels. Last week, they collected 37 knives in four hours in Leytonstone, which they say came from both the parents of those who were carrying knives and the carriers themselves. 
Barrett, who has three sons aged 20, 22 and 23 and a 13-year-old daughter, said he felt it was important to talk to children “about what to be aware of in this day and age”. He said he felt there was a need for community-led amnesties, despite the Metropolitan police providing their own bins. 
“I’m from the streets, I’m genuine, I don’t get paid and I don’t tell people what to do, I give them the information and then give them the choice to do what they want to do,” said Barrett. 
“When it comes to youths, they can see that I genuinely care about them – especially the ones that turn their nose up and walk off. I run after them and tell them: ‘Listen, I’m not paid to be here, I’m here because I care about you.’” 
Earlier this year, it was reported that the number of knife amnesty bins, credited with taking 50,000 weapons off the streets of London, had halved in the past seven years. 
In 2012, there were 36 Word 4 Weapons bin locations where knives and guns could be dropped off, which had dropped to 18."
140,crime,UK urged to act over men facing death in Egypt for alleged childhood crimes,"A group of British MPs has called on the foreign secretary to intervene in the case of four young men facing a death sentence in Cairo for crimes they allegedly committed as children. One of them is Ammar El Sudany, who was in the bath when Egyptian security forces raided his home. Only given enough time to throw on shorts and a T-shirt, the then 17-year-old was blindfolded and frogmarched from the building in handcuffs. Now, three years on, he faces being sentenced to death on Monday at a mass trial of 304 people at the north Cairo military court, which has rumbled on for more than two years. According to his family, he was arrested only because his father was a supporter of the deposed president, Mohamed Morsi, and has never attended a demonstration. It is claimed that the four men were charged with two offences of being members of a terrorist cell, after being arrested without a warrant and forced to make confessions under torture. Last month, a cross-party group of MPs and Lords wrote to Dominic Raab asking him to act. “Your intervention could ensure these young men are not sentenced to death,” the letter read. In a separate letter, Labour’s shadow minister for peace and disarmament, Fabian Hamilton, also urged Raab to intervene in the case. On Friday, a group of UN human rights experts urged the Egyptian authorities to release the men. When the security forces came for El Sudany he was preparing to go to the Berkat Sabaa secondary school in Monofiyah, 50 miles north of Cairo. He had memorised the Qur’an and, an able mathematician, wanted to pursue a career in engineering. His favourite hobby was Arabic painting and calligraphy. Now, as his friends contemplate their university careers, El Sudany is a broken man, his body ravaged by beatings and torture that have left him, in his mother’s words, like the “people of the cave”, a reference to the Qur’anic story of those who lived in a cave for hundreds of years. He was arrested on 4 December 2016, the day after his father, Yasser Abdelaziz El Sudany, had been detained for supporting Morsi, the democratically elected president overthrown in a military coup in 2013.     Ammar El Sudany was arrested in 2016. Photograph: Courtesy of Reprieve    He was reportedly hung by his arms for three days and subjected to electric shock torture, even on his genitals. Some beatings allegedly took place in the presence of his father, who pleaded with his interrogators to stop the torture, saying he would admit anything if his son was spared. The teenager confessed to being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, the party Morsi had led but which is now a banned terrorist organisation under the new president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. The authorities accused El Sudany of joining a group called Hasm, a movement that draws young people to carry out violent attacks on the army, police and state institutions. But his family said he was just a normal schoolboy wanting to do his best in life. His mother, who did not wish to be named, wept as she told how her son has to fend for himself in a tiny, crowded cell, with nothing to occupy his time. She said: “It is very difficult for Ammar to sleep due to the lack of space in his cell and the number of people in it. All cellmates must share one blanket, with no mattress. They sleep on the ground on top of one blanket, with nothing on top of them. “Ammar has never been allowed pen and paper since his arrest. He is allowed no activities and no outdoor time. “Ammar was an outstanding student. His friends are in university now, and he has been prohibited from taking any exams in prison.” In November 2019, the UN working group on arbitrary detention demanded Egypt immediately release and compensate the men, saying capital punishment can never be imposed on children. Caroline Lucas, who led the cross-party group of six MPs and five members of the House of Lords, said: “It is chilling that these young men are facing the death penalty in a mass trial of 304 people, after being arrested as children without warrants and subject to torture and incommunicado detention.   Related: Boris Johnson urged to confront Egypt leader over human rights    “If the UK’s commitment to human rights is to mean anything, the government must not remain silent in a case such as this. The foreign secretary should condemn this litany of abuses and call on President Sisi to ensure these men are not sentenced to death. “We are appalled by this injustice and urge you in the strongest terms to act to prevent the imposition of death sentences on these young men, who have already been taken form their families and schools, and suffered torture and imprisonment, as teenagers.” A spokesperson from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: “The UK strongly opposes the death penalty in all circumstances. We regularly voice our concerns to the Egyptian authorities and will be raising this case via our embassy in Cairo.” According to the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, 82 people are at imminent risk of execution in political cases. In 2019, 320 people were sentenced to death in 170 cases, both political and criminal. There were 18 executions in six cases. Maya Foa, director of Reprieve, the human rights charity, said: “When we hear about mass trials where hundreds of defendants face death sentences, caged together in a courtroom, it can be easy to forget that each of those people has a story and a family. “So when a mother breaks into tears after being asked to describe her son’s condition following months of torture and mistreatment, it reminds us of the human cost of President Sisi’s crackdown on dissent. “Ammar El Sudany was a promising student on the cusp of adulthood, tortured and beaten simply because his father spoke out against Egypt’s ruler.”"
141,crime,Australia urged to stop selling weapons to countries accused of war crimes,"Human rights groups say it is “unthinkable” that Australia has been secretly exporting arms to the war-ravaged Democratic Republic of Congo and other countries whose militaries have been consistently accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Guardian revealed on Tuesday that the Australian government had approved the export of weapons to the Democratic Republic of Congo four times in 2018-19. It has also issued more than 80 weapons export permits to Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The DRC has been gripped by successive waves of violence, rebellions, protests and political turmoil for decades. As recently as Friday, the United Nations warned ethnic killings and rape occurring in the DRC represented crimes against humanity.   Related: 'Blanket secrecy' surrounds Australian weapons sales to countries accused of war crimes    Save the Children estimates more than five million people have been forced to flee their homes in the DRC alone, and says millions of children are “desperately in need of humanitarian assistance”. The chief executive of Save the Children Australia, Paul Ronalds, said the public would be shocked to learn their government was approving weapons sales in such an environment. “The fact we weren’t previously aware that Australia was exporting weapons to the DRC says it all really,” Ronalds told the Guardian. “It is unthinkable that Australian arms could potentially be fuelling these conflicts, and it’s kept a secret from the public. “The public has a right to know where Australian-made arms are going, especially when taxpayers’ money is being used to market the industry to the world.” Arms sales to the DRC are strictly controlled by sanctions, first imposed during the country’s brutal civil war, which killed five million people between 1997 and 2003. Arms sales were previously prohibited to the DRC government, but this embargo was lifted in 2008. However, all arms sales to the country must be declared to the UN security council. Last month, the council’s sanctions committee for the DRC was told by a panel of experts that arms embargoes were potentially being violated through undeclared weapons sales. “The co-ordinator also expressed concerns on potential violations of the arms embargo by member states that supplied weapons to the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo without notifying the committee, as well as the transfer of weapons and ammunition from some of the Congolese security forces to armed groups.” Over the 2018-19 financial year, Australia issued 45 weapons export permits to the United Arab Emirates, 23 to Saudi Arabia, 14 to Sri Lanka and four to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Militaries and militias in all of those countries have been consistently accused of human rights violations, including war crimes, and crimes against humanity. The extent of and extreme secrecy surrounding Australia’s foreign weapons sales are revealed by documents obtained by the Guardian under freedom of information. The department of defence used the ‘commercial-in-confidence’ clause of the freedom of information act to refuse to reveal how many weapons have been sold, to whom, for how much, or for what purpose. Save for their existence and confirmation of country of destination, the documents have been almost entirely redacted by the government. That decision is being challenged by the Guardian. Phil Lynch, the director of International Service for Human Rights, said it was difficult to imagine how weapons sold by Australia to countries responsible for widespread and systematic human rights violations could not in any way contribute to those abuses. “Governments and military and security personnel in each of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Sri Lanka and the DRC have been found to be responsible for or complicit in grave, widespread and systematic human rights violations. In each case, weapons, weapons systems and surveillance technology sold from abroad have been used in and enabled these atrocities.” Lynch told the Guardian international human rights law was clear: the Australian government and companies had a duty to protect human rights and to ensure that their goods, products, services and supply chains were not implicated in human rights violations. “It’s pretty basic. Australia shouldn’t be arming authoritarian regimes and brutish thugs.” And he said Australia’s secrecy over its foreign weapons sales was unjustified. “Access to information, particularly information pertaining to possible human rights violations, is a fundamental tenet of democracy and of good and accountable government.”       All exports of arms require licences from the defence department’s export controls branch. The department has previously told Senate estimates that export licences are not issued if the weapons are likely to be used in human rights abuses. “If we assess that they would be used [to commit human rights abuses], we would not approve the permit,” Tom Hamilton, then acting deputy secretary of the defence department’s strategic policy and intelligence group, said in February.   Related: Australia's arms deals unaacceptable on moral grounds, former defence official says    Defence says it runs rigorous risk assessments on weapons prior to export. That process involves examining human rights, Australia’s international obligations, foreign policy, national security and regional security. But Australia has grown increasingly secretive about the weapons it manufactures and sells overseas. Previously, it produced an annual report about foreign weapons sales, but stopped declaring the information in 2004. Unlike major defence exporters the UK, the US and France, Australia does not provide information on the country of destination of defence exports. Australian exports are publicly reported only by region, making a freedom of information request the only way to reveal which individual countries are buying Australian-built weapons. Democracies similar to to Australia – such as the Netherlands, the UK, the US, New Zealand, Canada, Germany, Spain and France – all provide public, detailed annual reports, covering information such as destination countries, value of exports, trends and reasons for permit denials. Some exporting countries provide information on permit approvals on a monthly or even real-time basis."
142,crime,The best recent crime and thrillers – review roundup,"    After her award-winning fictionalised account of a 1950s serial killer, The Long Drop, Denise Mina returns to the present day with Conviction (Harvill Secker, £14.99), a thoroughly modern tale of sexual and financial predation and social media. Anna McDonald is on the run from an unspecified traumatic incident in her past. Having fled London, she has reinvented herself in Glasgow, and is now partner to lawyer Hamish and mother to Jess and Lizzie. A fan of true crime podcasts, she has just started Death and the Dana, the story of a sunken yacht with a murdered family on board, when Hamish announces that he is leaving her. Distraught, Anna runs away once more and finds herself trying to determine what really happened to Leon Parker, the man found dead on the yacht, with whom she has a connection. The initial impetus for the investigation may be a stretch, but the narrative is plausible and compelling, as the mysteries of Parker’s fate and Anna’s past unfold in parallel and collide, dangerously, in the present.      The first book in Jeffery Deaver’s new series, The Never Game (HarperCollins, £20), also begins with a sinking boat, as the protagonist Colter Shaw struggles to rescue a heavily pregnant woman from the Pacific Ocean. Her fate still in the balance, we rewind two days to when Shaw – an altruistic loner who learned tracking skills from his survivalist father and now travels around the US finding missing persons – strikes out on the trail of a Silicon Valley teenager whose disappearance the authorities refuse to take seriously. When a second person is abducted, Shaw starts to discover alarming parallels with a video game called The Whispering Man, in which players must find a way to escape from a perilous situation with only five objects to help them. So far, so nail-biting, although tech-heavy descriptions soon start to clog up the narrative flow, and clumsy use of withholding devices towards the end may leave fans of Deaver’s other series hero Lincoln Rhyme feeling shortchanged.      There are more survivalist skills on display in The River by Peter Heller (W&amp;N, £14.99). Student buddies Wynn and Jack are on a canoeing trip in the Canadian wilderness. The fog has settled and, realising that a wildfire is heading in their direction, the pair decide to turn back and warn a couple they overheard arguing on the bank. They find only the husband, Pierre, who claims that his wife has disappeared. Fearing that he may have harmed her – his behaviour is suspicious, and he has an unexplained injury – they investigate and find her alive, but badly injured. With no way of summoning help, they are soon engaged in a race for their lives against not only the fire, the weather and the wildlife, but also the potentially homicidal Pierre. Divisions between easygoing optimist Wynn and cynical pessimist Jack grow as their predicament worsens, and there is plenty of tension here, but where Heller really scores is the extraordinarily high quality of his writing about the natural world, which is lyrical and action-packed by turns.      Photograph: No credit    The danger is much closer to home in Crushed by Kate Hamer (Faber, £12.99), an exploration of the dark heart of female adolescence that makes good use of its Bath setting. Overwrought Phoebe’s belief that she is a witch is fuelled by her study of Macbeth; sweet-natured, compliant Orla is hopelessly in love with her; and tough-minded Grace juggles school with caring for her bedridden mother. Rather than mystery, family traumas and teenage hysteria fuel the baggy plot, and when Phoebe begins a clandestine relationship with her English teacher, it’s clearly not going to end well.      The folklore surrounding witches and changelings is very much to the fore in Melanie Golding’s first novel, Little Darlings (HQ, £12.99). Exhausted new mother Lauren Tranter is convinced that somebody is trying to steal her twin babies but nobody, including her obviously bad-egg husband, believes her. Detective Sergeant Jo Harper’s intuition tells her that there’s more to the situation than meets the eye – and then the babies are taken during an outing to a park. This debut is atmospheric and very creepy indeed.      Parker Bilal, author of the Cairo-based Makana Mysteries, has begun a new series set in London, featuring DS Calil Drake and forensic psychiatrist Rayhana Crane. The Divinities (Indigo, £8.99) begins with two bodies found trussed and buried alive under a mound of rock on a Battersea building site. It has many of the tropes of the traditional police procedural, including savage internal politics and a detective with emotional baggage who is trying to get his stalled career back on track. However, a plot involving unfettered capitalism, fundamentalist zealotry and racism, refracted through the eyes of the two mixed-race protagonists who are forced to mine their pasts serving in Iraq for answers, results in a propulsive narrative. This is a fresh and vivid portrait of a city that is less melting pot than explosive pressure cooker. • Laura Wilson’s The Other Woman is published by Quercus."
143,crime,Knife crime: using the power of drill music to tackle gang culture,"Like the rap duo Krept and Konan, Jinx Prowse, who runs the Music Fusion youth project in Hampshire, believes a police clampdown on drill music is not the answer to knife crime. “Gangs and their culture exist first. This then informs the music. Banning drill would be a naive and impotent response to addressing the real issues behind gang culture.” 
“We give young people somewhere to belong, respect, a platform to express themselves and a safe place to hang out. Their music can be the first step in moving away from crime.” 
The idea of using music to help young people improve their lives is central to the work of Music Fusion, which serves areas of extreme social deprivation in Portsmouth, Havant, Southampton, Gosport and Fareham. Nestled next to Havant’s tiny local museum, its studios rub up uneasily with the area’s seaside tourism. 
London’s black communities may have been in the spotlight during the recent surge in knife crime, but predominantly white populations in provincial towns can also be badly affected. A Guardian analysis of official statistics this year showed a 46% average increase in knife-related offences in 34 English and Welsh counties since 2010, compared with an 11% rise in the capital. In 2010-11, there were 451 crimes involving knives or sharp implements in Hampshire. That had risen to 868 by 2017-18, although numbers dipped slightly this year. 
 
  
  Courtney, 13, credits rapping at Music Fusion with getting her back into a mainstream school after being excluded 
  
 
Music Fusion aims to channel troubled youngsters’ energy away from crime, violence and anger by offering courses in rapping, singing and music production. But it is rap with a difference. 
“They have sometimes [already] been rapping in an American accent about violence and having loads of women and money, but that is not their reality,” says Prowse. “We keep the same beats but I tell them what we are looking for is to emulate conscientious rappers who rap about things that are important to them.” 
The project is working against the backdrop of a national debate over how to solve the problem of serious youth violence. A recent report from the home affairs select committee said there was a “serious mismatch” between the government’s diagnosis of the problem and its solutions, citing evidence linking deprivation and vulnerability with knife crime and violence. Labelling the situation a “social emergency”, MPs called for greater investment in early intervention and youth services.

In and around Portsmouth, mounting tensions and violent incidents between feuding young people in different postcodes led to Music Fusion launching its Words Not Weapons scheme. 
Matt Stevens, 25, now a music leader at the charity, was one of the youngsters who agreed to take part when it began in 2011. As a teenager he says he was often in trouble with the police, and was thrown out of school and a pupil referral unit (PRU). 
“I was feuding with some guy from Gosport, he was sending people to find me and I was sending people to find him. It was a couple of days away from us stabbing one another … It was over nothing, over a postcode.” 
The scheme brought them together. “At the time I was a hungry artist and I just wanted to be in the studio … So I agreed to shake hands with my mortal enemy,” says Stevens. “The studio session was set up, in he walked and we stared at each other for a couple of minutes, then we shook hands and we cracked on with the first Words Not Weapons album. We’re still friends.” 
The scheme ended in May, but Music Fusion hopes to get funding to run it again. Almost half the charity’s funding is from the lottery, channeled through national charity Youth Music, and the rest comes from public donations and a grant from the Home Office and Hampshire county council. But cuts mean it is no longer open access. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
The charity engages around 1,400 young people a year, including teenagers who have been affected by bullying, depression and self-harm, or who are unable to attend mainstream school. It has changed lives: Courtney, 13, who was excluded from two schools and put in a PRU, credits rapping at Music Fusion with getting back into a mainstream school after six months. 
Kizz, 18, was bullied, has had depression and has self-harmed. Before he came to Music Fusion, aged 13, he was “ready to commit suicide”, he says. “Because I know I can sit down and write my feelings out, rather than coping the wrong ways … knowing I can influence someone else, that makes me feel like my life is more worth living.” In an independent social impact assessment, more than two-thirds of Music Fusion participants said the charity “believed in me when many others didn’t”. And the vast majority said it had given them advice that had stopped them going to prison. 
Kane, 13, a former young offender who is still reeling from his girlfriend’s fatal stabbing a year ago, says of the opportunity to rap and perform: “It raises me up a little bit, makes me feel good about myself.”"
144,crime,BAE Systems accused of being party to alleged war crimes,"A group of human rights organisations have filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court (ICC), accusing BAE Systems and other arms manufacturers based in Europe of being party to alleged war crimes in the conflict in Yemen. Their 350-page dossier argues that aircraft, missiles and other arms made by 10 companies “contributed to the capacity” of the Saudi-led coalition in the conflict, which is accused of bombing schools, hospitals and civilians in 26 airstrikes. Radhya Almutawakel, the chair of a Yemeni organisation Mwatana for Human Rights, said: “Saudi/UAE-led coalition airstrikes have caused terrible destruction in Yemen. Weapons produced and exported by the US and Europe have enabled this destruction. “Five years into this war, the countless Yemeni victims deserve credible investigations into all perpetrators of crimes against them, including those potentially complicit.” Over 100,000 people are estimated to have been killed since war in Yemen broke out in 2015, including 12,000 civilians in directly targeted attacks. The Saudi-led coalition intervened in 2015 against the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels with a pattern of airstrikes that has brought repeated humanitarian criticism. The 26 strikes specifically cited, where 135 people were killed and 181 injured, include what are described as indiscriminate attacks on hospitals and schools by bombers from Saudi Arabia or its ally the United Arab Emirates, and where remnants of bombs made by companies based in Europe were discovered. The human-rights groups, who also include Amnesty International and Campaign Against the Arms Trade, met with members of the prosecutors’ office on Wednesday afternoon in The Hague, where the ICC is located, to hand over the file. Linde Bryk, a lawyer representing the human rights groups said: “By seeking an investigation into corporate executives and government officials the communication seeks to hold to account those selling arms to countries known to have committed war crimes.” BAE Systems is cited in the complaint because the British arms giant is the principal supplier of Eurofighter Tornado and Typhoon jet aircraft to the Royal Saudi Air Force, which has conducted a string of deadly strikes Yemen, as is the UK arm of Raytheon, which manufactures Paveway IV guided missiles used in the conflict. In the case of BAE Systems, it argues that the company “purposely intended” to supply the Saudis with arms, and after the conflict began company bosses would have become aware of “the abundance of reporting on the violations being committed”. It argues: “The use of Eurofighter and Tornado jets by the coalition in Yemen – that the realisation of the war crimes, for example the intentionally targeting of civilians, attacks on schools, hospitals and cultural heritage, was a consequence of the assistance in the ordinary course of events.” It also references Airbus companies in Spain and Germany, France’s Dassault and Thales, Italian group Leonardo, the Italian arm of Germany’s Rheinmetall and units of European missile manufacturer MBDA in France and Britain. Dassault supplies fighter aircraft to the UAE. Companies based in the UK are the largest exporter of arms to Saudi Arabia between 2015 and 2019, accounting for €5.8bn worth, according to publicly available data in the complaint. Firms based in France were recorded as doing €2.5bn worth of business, and their German equivalents €1.5bn. BAE Systems has previously defended its sales to Saudi Arabia, saying it is a defence company which complies with UK arms export regulations. New arms sales to Saudi Arabia which could be used in Yemen have been on hold since June when the British court of appeal said that ministers had not properly assessed the risk they would be used in breach of international humanitarian law. Raytheon’s chief executive of international operations has previously said the company’s role is to comply with existing arms export policies."
145,crime,Why are women obsessed with true crime? Rachel Monroe has some answers,"Why are so many women obsessed with true crime – and what does it say about our society? In Savage Appetites: Four True Stories of Women, Crime and Obsession (Scribner, 20 August), journalist Rachel Monroe weaves crime reporting, cultural criticism and personal essay into a study of true crime and its seductive power. The book’s subjects include an industrial heiress who revolutionizes American forensic science; a woman whose life becomes strangely intertwined with the victims of the Manson murders; a landscape architect who falls in love with a wrongly convicted prisoner; and a Columbine fangirl who decides to plan her own mass killing.   book   Your book is both a work of true crime and a kind of meta-analysis of true crime as a cultural phenomenon. How did the book come about? A lot of the critiques of true crime that I read seemed to come from people who, in a knee-jerk way, found the genre objectionable or not to their taste. It seemed to me that the best critiques came from a position of intimacy or affection, and that’s what made me feel that it was a worthy project to embark on. I wanted to know how these stories have such a hold on me, and on lots of other people, too. As you point out in Savage Appetites, the consumers of true crime are overwhelmingly female. Why do you think that is? It’s complex and there’s no single, monolithic answer – in part because there’s no single, monolithic woman.  One common, overarching explanation is that true crime stories allow women to talk about and explore vulnerability. Reading a true crime story about a stalker who murdered his girlfriend might be a way for a woman to process her own anxieties. But I think there’s a danger in that formulation. It risks replicating cultural ideas about who is the most dangerous and who deserves protection and who doesn’t. One thing troubling about the true crime genre is how disproportionately it favors stories about attractive middle-class white women who’ve gone missing versus stories about the people who are much more likely to suffer violence in our society. When was the last time Oxygen or Investigation Discovery did a show about sex workers? Or young black men, who are actually the primary victims of violence in the United States? Those victims don’t make it onto those shows. Something that has come to frustrate me about true crime – or at least much of what we call true crime – is that it focuses so much on individual psychology. The villain is always an individual bad person instead of equally important, but more complicated, structural factors, like the jurisdictional squabbles that make Native American women vulnerable. Yet those are things we could actually fix. Is true crime inherently exploitative, in the Journalist and the Murderer sense? I don’t think it’s inherently exploitative. I think it’s inherently emotionally and ethically complicated. Anyone who pretends it isn’t is suspect to me. But true crime stories can be a force for justice, too, or a quest to understand the world, or vehicle for showing how power works – who gets to exercise it, who doesn’t. When I wrote about Ashlynne Mike, a Navajo girl who was kidnapped, I was trying to use her story to bring attention to a community that gets otherwise overlooked. Because crime writing is so fraught I think those of us who do this work need to be extra careful. And I think that’s fine. In doing my own reporting I have been surprised at how often I feel so … hesitant, and cautious, in approaching victims and their families. On the other hand, I’m often surprised at how much they have to say and how much they want to talk. I think that people caught up in these awful situations have a lot to tell us. Plus, for them, the worst has already happened. As our culture and our politics change, are there crime movies or TV shows or books you used to enjoy that you now can’t? Or vice versa? There was a period of my life when I treated true crime, or crime entertainment in general, as pure escapism. I watched Law and Order: SVU and read a lot of Ann Rule’s books. I can’t enjoy her books in such uncomplicated ways anymore; I see how beholden she is to her police sources and how consistently pro-law enforcement she is. But I like my true crime a bit problematic. When the feminist strands bump up against the more conservative, Law and Order strands, I think it’s really interesting and illuminating and revealing, and that’s all there in Ann Rule’s work. You start to notice how often popular culture uses the “dead girl” as a plot device. There is something about being a woman – particularly a white woman – where you see your own vulnerability represented a lot. There’s a ton of cultural attention on it. In some ways that’s a privilege – as compared to other groups, whose experiences of violence are treated as unremarkable by the media. But it is awful the extent to which the best way to get on the news, if you are a woman, is to have violence committed against you. In her book Dead Girls: Essays on Surviving an American Obsession, Alice Bolin looks at shows like True Detective and Twin Peaks and countless others where the inciting incident for a man’s quest or adventure or voyage of self-discovery is a dead girl. I think a lot of true crime fandom, especially for women, exists in this zone between privilege and vulnerability. To enjoy it you need to be privileged enough to not live it in your daily reality – if it’s your own life, it’s hard to find entertaining – but also enough aware of your own vulnerability to empathize. It’s always complicated. In Savage Appetites – as well as a 2012 piece for the Awl – you discuss the phenomenon of “Columbiners”: people, often teenage girls, who idolize mass killers. What is that about? When I started writing about Columbiners in 2012, I saw them as a “fandom”, primarily a teenage girl fandom, who spoke in a language of “crushes”: “I don’t condone what the shooter did, but he’s so cute, I love him.” Teenage girls are so self-conscious and self-aware. I wondered: what if they’re trying to tell us something through this language of “crushing”? I was thinking about the internet as a place to play with language and ideas that aren’t quite real. But while I was researching Lindsay Souvannarath – who actually did go from being a Columbiner to planning a mass shooting – I had to do some reckoning. It’s the same reckoning I think a lot of us have had in the past couple years – that just because something happens online doesn’t mean it’s less real. Ironic online Nazis are still Nazis. There are real-world consequences. I found it harder to think of Columbiners as engaged in some kind of subversive, ironic “play”. I think it probably is, for some people, but their subversive, ironic play still feeds the valorization of mass killers and encourages them to do what they do. If you are sharing Columbine memes, maybe you don’t really “want” anyone to commit shootings, but you’re contributing to that culture. Yet I should note that I went back recently, to look for the Tumblr girls I wrote about seven years earlier. Of the ones I found, none were still in that world. None were still doing Columbine posts. Many had become quite politically active. For some, Columbiner culture had been about feeling alienated or depressed or out of touch with the world, and now they are channeling those energies into more productive purposes.

146,crime,Illegal metal-detecting at English Heritage sites doubles in two years,"Organised crime is being blamed for a rise in illegal metal-detecting at heritage sites, including one of England’s finest medieval castles and the battlefield of Hastings. English Heritage said December last year was the worst month for such incidents in more than four years and there were more than double the number of incidents in 2019 as there were in 2017. In some cases there were up to 100 holes where the illegal metal detectorists – known as nighthawkers – had dug up the soil. “How many of those are productive we just don’t know,” said Win Scutt, a properties curator and archaeologist at English Heritage. The organisation is calling on members of the public to become its “eyes and ears” and report suspicious activity to the police. However, after some violent incidents it advised people not to confront nighthawkers. Scutt said it was not only about artefacts being dug up, taken and presumably sold. “It is the damage to the sites. They are destroying the archaeological record. You can compare it to a scene of crime and seeing a knife and a gun and thinking: ‘I’ll be helpful, I’ll take them along to the police,’ and they say: ‘You’ve just destroyed all the information.’ “This is why we protect our sites so carefully. Not even we dig them. We are trying to preserve the record for future generations.” Scutt said the activity was distressing. “These sites are in a sense libraries of archaeological information and poking holes in them is like burning down a library of documents that have never been read.” English Heritage said sites targeted included the Hastings battlefield in East Sussex, Goodrich Castle in Herefordshire and Old Sarum in Wiltshire, the site of Salisbury’s original cathedral.     Evidence of nighthawking at Old Sarum. Photograph: English Heritage    The majority of the more than 400 places maintained by English Heritage were unstaffed and free to enter. Scutt said he did not think ordinary metal detectorists would be naive enough to think it was acceptable or legal to use their detectors on scheduled monuments. “There seems to be a criminal element deliberately going on to our sites. We attribute the increase to organised crime … they are going for the goodies and they don’t care.” Mark Harrison, the head of crime strategy at Historic England, said it was not a victimless crime. “We may never see or fully understand the objects taken or damaged because they have been removed from their original sites with no care or record as to their history or context.” "
147,crime,NCA predicts rise in online child sexual abuse during coronavirus pandemic," The National Crime Agency (NCA) has warned there could be a rise in online child sexual abuse offences during the Covid-19 pandemic as it reveals its most recent intelligence shows there are at least 300,000 people in the UK who pose a sexual threat to children. The figure, which comes from intelligence pre-dating the coronavirus outbreak, reflects a new assessment of the threat and is far higher than previous estimates. The NCA believes there are a minimum 300,000 individuals in the UK posing a sexual threat to children, either through physical contact abuse or online. NCA investigators have also found that is possible to access child sexual abuse content on the open web in just three clicks. The figure is from the NCA’s latest national strategic assessment, which will be published online on Friday, and comes amid warnings from charities and law enforcement agencies over heightened risks during the coronavirus crisis. The NCA revealed offenders are already discussing opportunities over online chat forums to abuse children during the Covid-19 crisis. The National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for child protection, Simon Bailey, chief constable of Norfolk police, said: “It is sickening to think that some criminals are looking to exploit the coronavirus crisis to cause harm online. Despite the issues that the pandemic will cause for law enforcement, child protection is still a priority and we remain totally committed to keeping our young people safe.” The number of child safety concerns reported through the child exploitation and online protection command website since schools closed because of coronavirus has stayed largely the same, the NCA said. While there has been decreased reporting from professionals, such as teachers and social workers, the level of reports from children has remained stable. A host of educational products aimed at children of all ages, parents, carers and teachers will be issued through the agency’s Thinkuknow website and social media channels. Rob Jones, the NCA director of threat leadership, said: “Preventing offences occurring is always crucial and now more so than ever when there is masses of online traffic and a possible elevated threat to children. “We are redoubling our efforts to promote our online safety messages to children, parents, carers and teachers and are working with partners to keep children safe.” The NCA and UK policing arrest more than 500 child sex offenders and safeguard about 700 children each month. The NCA warning comes as new research showed that residential schools for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) recorded nearly 10 times the number of safeguarding concerns of a sexual nature than other residential schools. The study by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) is based on in-depth research at a small sample of mainstream residential schools, including private schools and state boarding schools, as well as Send residential schools for students. It found that online and peer-on-peer abuse were the most common safeguarding concerns of a sexual nature, and highlighted the challenge of managing children’s online safety and peer relationships within the context of round-the-clock care. “Alongside more serious reports of sexual violence and assault,” the report said, “some mainstream schools also recorded, for example, sexting and a range of peer-on-peer concerns.   Related: 'I can't know the children are safe': social workers' fears over lockdown    “It seems unlikely that these issues were not also happening in other schools; rather, they were not being recorded in safeguarding logs, but perhaps elsewhere in behavioural logs. “In addition, in special schools, some concerns with a sexual element seemed to relate to young people experiencing or exploring their bodies with no intent to harm.” Nancy Kelley, deputy chief executive of the National Centre for Social Research which produced the report on behalf of IICSA, said: “This research uncovers the unique challenges involved in safeguarding children in residential schools. Managing relationships between pupils, overseeing children’s online activity, and communicating with local authorities are all key areas of concern for these schools.” IICSA was set up in 2015 because of serious concerns that some organisations had failed and were continuing to fail to protect children from sexual abuse. This latest research drew on interviews with 150 staff, pupils and parents and analysis of the safeguarding logs of 15 residential schools across England and Wales."
148,crime,Andrea Camilleri had a late but great career in crime writing,"Andrea Camilleri, who has died aged 93, was one of the latest starters and latest finishers in crime fiction. He was almost 70 – after a rich career as a theatre director, TV producer, playwright and novelist in other genres – when, finding himself stuck on a historical story, he distracted himself by quickly writing a detective story. In a sort of literary European Union, he was influenced by three literary heroes: the Belgian Georges Simenon, creator of Inspector Maigret; Leonardo Sciascia, author of The Day of the Owl, who was a native of Sicily like Camilleri; and the Spanish writer Manuel Vázquez Montalbán. First met by Italian readers in La forma dell’acqua in 1994 (in English as The Shape of Water in 2002), Camilleri’s cop, Commissario Salvo Montalbano shared many traits with his creator: a Sicilian with a love of literature, cigarettes and food. As in Montalbán’s Inspector Pepe Carvalho books, Montalbano – named in homage to the Spanish novelist – uses delicious cuisine as a counterweight to his deathly profession. Eating, Camilleri liked to say, is one of the greatest pleasures the dead surrender. After his delayed start in the mystery form, Camilleri wrote fast. Their sales accelerated by an atmospheric TV series (seen on BBC4 in the UK and SBS in Australia), 27 Montalbano novels have been published in Italy to date. The 24th will make it to English this September, when The Other End of the Line will be published. That book starts with Montalbano dealing with a huge group of political refugees arriving on the Sicilian coast – a characteristic topicality in a series of novels that have followed Italy into the eras of the euro, the contentious governments of Silvio Berlusconi (to whom Camilleri was strongly opposed), and Euroscepticism.   Related: Andrea Camilleri: a life in writing    “In many crime novels, the events seem completely detached from the economic, political and social context in which they occur. In my books, I deliberately decided to smuggle into a detective novel a critical commentary on my times,” he told me when I interviewed him in Rome – still furiously chain-smoking at the age of 88 – in 2012. A strong undercurrent in the Montalbano books is the pressure on the Italian state from three outside sources: the Roman Catholic church, the US and the mafia. Having grown up in Sicily, the motherland of Italian organised crime, Camilleri used his fiction to mock and expose the mob, as Sciascia had. The bravura opening of Camilleri’s The Potters Field gives Montalbano a nightmare in which the mafia has become the government of the country openly, rather than, as the reader is invited to think, covertly. “An amazing thing happens in Italy,” Camilleri told me. “That we have MPs and senators involved with the mafia. They continue to be called honourable when they are not at all. It’s not far from that to taking over power.” He considered it his duty to speak out against the dark politics by which his country was often seduced, regularly appearing as a pundit on Italian TV shows where he was torrentially opinionated, intelligent and witty. Camilleri became so recognisable that, unusually for a novelist, he was impersonated by satirists and comedians. Complimented for “courage” in calling out the gangsters, Camilleri pointed out that he was the beneficiary of the contradiction that mafiosi hated criticism from judges and journalists – many of whom they executed – but were flattered by being fictionalised; for example, obsessively quoting The Godfather. The pleasure of his own crime fiction was often informed by his long career before arriving at the genre. Producing a long-running Italian TV adaptation of Simenon’s Maigret novels gave him an intensive course in plotting. Decades of directing the game-playing stage plays of Luigi Pirandello, such as Six Characters in Search of an Author, showed in Camilleri’s fondness for structural tricks. The two writers shared a Sicilian birthplace, Porto Empedocle, where statues of Pirandello and Camilleri now face each other in the town. There will be at least one more novel. In our interview, he told me that – as Agatha Christie did with Hercule Poirot in Curtain – he had deposited with his publisher Riccardino, a final novel in which Montalbano is “finished off” that was to only be published posthumously. It should be a fitting epitaph to one of the latest, but greatest, careers in crime writing."
149,crime,Liam Gallagher challenges Sadiq Khan over rise in knife crime,"Liam Gallagher has criticised London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, over rising knife crime in the capital and expressed his fears for the safety of his children. 
The former Oasis singer, 46, said: “Every time you wake up in the morning, there’s some 16-year-old kid been knifed to death. I’ve got kids that age, out and about and that, doing their thing, living, being young. That freaks me right out – it does worry me. I’ve got teenagers.” 
Gallagher, who lives in north London, has four children, including his sons Gene, 17, and Lennon, 19. He also has two daughters – Molly, 22, and six-year-old Gemma. 
He singled out Khan for apparent inaction in the knife-crime crisis on BBC Breakfast on Monday. 
He said: “I’d have a word with that mayor – he seems to not be doing a good job, all them kids getting knifed and all that. The only thing that ever comes out of his mouth is, ‘London is open.’ What, open for knife crime and dying and stuff?” 
The killings last weekend of four people within four days in London put knife crime in the capital in the international spotlight, with Donald Trump also criticising Khan over his handling of the issue. 
 
  
  
   
    What is the scale of the problem?
    
    Police chiefs have described the recent spate of knife crime as ‘a national emergency’. In the first two months of 2019 there were 17 homicides in London alone, where 35% of all knife crimes are committed.
    The number of NHS England admissions among people aged 10-19 with knife wounds has risen 60% in five years, surpassing 1,000 last year.
    The number of knife and offensive weapon offences in England and Wales have risen to their highest level for nearly a decade, with the number of cases dealt with by the criminal justice system up by more than a third since 2015. Knife crime-related offences recorded by the police rose by 8% in England and Wales in 2018.
    Figures on sentences handed out for such crimes, published by the Ministry of Justice, showed there were 22,041 knife and weapon offences formally dealt with by the criminal justice system in the year ending March 2019. This is the highest rate since 2010, when the number was 23,667.
    
    
    What happens to people caught with knives?
    
    In the year ending March 2019, 37% of knife and offensive weapon offences resulted in an immediate custodial sentence, compared with 22% in 2009, when the data was first published. The average length of the custodial sentences rose to the longest in a decade, from 5.5 months to 8.1 months.
    
    Are younger people more at risk of being involved in knife crime?
    
    The MoJ figures revealed that the number of juvenile offenders convicted or cautioned for possession or threats using a knife or offensive weapon increased by almost half (48%) between the year ending March 2015 and the year ending March 2019.
    The increase in adult offenders over the same period was smaller, at 31%. However, adult offenders still accounted for 74% of the total increase in cautions and convictions received for those offences in that period.
    
    What are the government doing about knife crime?
    
    In March 2019 chancellor, Philip Hammond, handed an extra £100m to police forces in England and Wales after a spate of fatal stabbings led to a renewed focus on rising knife crime and police resources.
    In the same month more than 10,000 knives were seized and 1,372 suspects arrested during a week-long national knife crime crackdown. Officers carried out 3,771 weapons searches, during which 342 knives were found. Another 10,215 were handed in as part of amnesties.
    A new Offensive Weapons Act was passed in May 2019, making it illegal to possess dangerous weapons including knuckledusters, zombie knives and death star knives. It also made it a criminal offence to dispatch bladed products sold online without verifying the buyer is over 18.

Gallagher, who last week claimed he would make a good prime minister because he has previously “dabbled in drugs”, also condemned politicians who use drugs. 
“I don’t hang out with politicians and I don’t hang out with celebrities that hang out with politicians or these fake rock’n’roll stars that hang out with politicians,” he said. 
“I just hang out with me and my missus and my kids, and my mates. But if I did see a politician taking drugs, man, he’d get a crack round the head.” 
He added: “They shouldn’t be … they’re meant to be running the country, aren’t they?” 
During the Conservative leadership race, the former candidate Rory Stewart admitted to having once taken opium, while Michael Gove admitted to taking cocaine more than 20 years ago. 
A spokesperson for Khan said: “Tackling violent crime is the mayor’s highest priority. He has invested record amounts in the Met, including funding the violent crime taskforce of nearly 300 officers dedicated to tackling violence.  
“However, he can’t fill the huge hole left by devastating Government cuts to the police, youth clubs and other vital public services. 
“Cuts have consequences - as even the Home Secretary has acknowledged, and the government needs to step up and reverse them.”

150,crime,Rising youth crime reflects wider societal problems,"The number of primary school children in pupil referral units (PRUs) in England has more than doubled since 2011, as part of a wider surge in the number of permanent exclusions in England and Wales over the past decade (Steep rise in under-11s excluded from school for being disruptive, 1 April). This is a symptom of wider societal problems; young people in disadvantaged areas, who are suffering as a result of cuts to their schools and youth services, understandably feel disillusioned and as though they’ve been abandoned. When disillusion occurs, crime, particularly youth crime, goes up. One thing I’d like to see is a special fund for children at risk of school exclusion, as a high percentage of perpetrators were excluded from school in their early teens. It’s something I raised with the secretary of state for communities and local government recently and David Lammy MP, and I will soon be meeting with him to discuss further. Such a fund would help families who might be struggling and would provide a continuity of care and support to children at risk of exclusion, which could help to combat the “PRU to prison pipeline” of disengaged young people in PRUs getting into a cycle of violence. All too often, excluded children bounce around the system while falling further away from mainstream education. This fund should also include targeted support and training for school staff who are on the frontline of what can be incredibly difficult situations at the same time as they are seeing their funding slashed.Catherine West MPLabour, Hornsey and Wood Green • The Home Office consultations on serious youth violence highlight police powers to stop and search, and call on public sector bodies to step up their duty of care in safeguarding young people (Teachers could have to report knife fears, 1 April). But if tackling the root causes of knife crime remains the priority, it’s time to invest in community responses – from the smallest neighbourhood activities to the specialist voluntary sector services – as the surest way of surrounding young people at risk, and their parents, with support structures that listen to their experiences, speak to their needs and act on what works for them.Steve PhaureCEO, Croydon Voluntary Action • Government plans to tackle knife crime may be unfair to teachers (Knife crime plan unfair to teachers, unions say, 2 April), but they are more unfair to young people. Stop and search does not work, alternatives-to-custody projects have stalled, and youth service provision has been cut drastically, while school exclusions rise. We need some real action and additional funds at the grassroots, not high-level summits with photo opportunities for politicians.Don MacdonaldChair, LFJ Youth Integration • Statistics relating to the sharp decline in youth services in London are only the tip of the iceberg because this vitally important service has been systematically decimated across most of England from 2011 onwards. There is a clear correlation between rising youth crime, young people’s involvement in county lines drug-dealing and the near decimation of professionally delivered youth services (Youth clubs shut across London as funds dry up, 23 March). When David Cameron set up the National Citizen Service along with his “big society” initiative in 2011, there was no indication that the NCS would eventually siphon off youth service budgets: this four-week summer citizenship scheme cannot be considered a valid substitute for year-round youth provision. In 2017, the MP’s report claimed that the high cost of the NCS cannot be justified.The House of Commons public accounts committee expressed concern about NCS exceeding its per-capita budget and it was confirmed that only 12% of eligible teenagers signed up for NCS in 2018. There is no doubt that the NCS provides some young people with a positive summer experience and participation in provides a boost to Ucas applications and higher education, but in my experience it is far removed from the reality of the world of young people involved in knife crime or who are being exploited by adult criminals. The Local Government Association recently expressed concern about the government’s allocation of £10m to improve the NCS brand image at a time when so many young people are isolated and seeking safety within street gangs or are excluded from their schools, bored and vulnerable to abuse. The £10m would have been better invested in youth outreach work and after-school provision. An independent inquiry into NCS and an analysis of NCS recruitment in relation to our poorest communities is needed as a matter of urgency and Sian Berry is right to call for reinvestment into our most valuable asset – our young people.Norma HornbyWarrington, Cheshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

151,crime,Church of England urged to offer haven from knife crime,"Churches should open their doors to provide a safe haven for young people at risk of knife crime during after-school flashpoints, the Church of England’s governing body will be told next month. Rosemarie Mallett, a vicar in Angell Town, Brixton, south London, will urge churches to offer themselves as sanctuaries, both for young people in need of a quiet, safe place and those urgently fleeing violent attacks. “In every place where there is a problem of serious youth violence, there is a church. Too often the doors are shut,” said Mallett, setting out her proposals before next month’s General Synod in York. “Is there a way that churches can be open, particularly between the hours of 3pm and 6pm, to be places of safety, of welcome, where young people can go?” She said Angell Town, where she has been vicar for 12 years, was “an area blighted by serious youth violence. Certainly my time there has been punctuated by too many deaths, too many young people. I’ve been involved in too many funerals.” But knife crime was not just a problem for inner cities, she added. Gang-related “county line” activity meant serious youth violence had spread. “It’s become a national problem.” In 2018 there were 40,000 knife crime offences in the UK, “the highest number since any kind of data was collected,” said Mallett. Churches should become part of a nexus of support along with other community groups and agencies, she said. Knife amnesty bins could be situated in churches, where young people might feel more inclined to take weapons than police stations. The C of E, which is the second largest provider of state education in the country, should monitor exclusions and develop strategies to minimise their number, Mallett said. There was a proven link between school exclusions, young people being sent to pupil referral units, and becoming involved in serious violence, she said. Training and resources should be provided to clergy and church leaders to increase awareness of the signs of vulnerability to gang exploitation. Mallett said youth provision in her area had been hit by government funding cuts, but she stressed that the church did not play the same role as the state. Young people came to her church “to use the space to have quiet time, to think about the situation they find themselves in.” At next month’s five-day synod session, members will also hear C of E plans to invest up to £63m to train the increasing number of people applying to become priests. In the past two years there has been a 23% increase in people training for ordination. David Walker, the bishop of Manchester, said in his diocese there had been particular growth in female and minority ethnic candidates for the priesthood. “The growth will help us deal with the demographic challenge of many existing clergy coming to retirement. It won’t necessarily mean a net increase in the number of stipendiary clergy, but it will stem the decline,” he said."
152,crime,Germany charges two Syrians with crimes against humanity,"Germany has charged two alleged former Syrian secret service officers with crimes against humanity, federal prosecutors have announced, a key step in a patchwork of international efforts to seek justice for atrocities committed during the country’s long civil war.  Anwar Raslan and Eyad al-Gharib were arrested in February, in a coordinated operation by German and French police. Raslan allegedly led an investigative unit with its own prison, known as Branch 251, near the Syrian capital, Damascus. Prosecutors claimed at least 4,000 people were tortured by his subordinates during interrogation there between April 2011 and 2012, with guards using bars, cables and whips to beat prisoners during interviews. Some prisoners were subjected to electric shocks, while others were “hung from the ceiling by their wrists, with only their toes touching the ground”, according to a statement by the German prosecutor. Many died as a result, and Raslan has been has been charged with 59 counts of murder, as well as rape and aggravated sexual assault. “As head of the investigation unit, the accused Anwar R determined and oversaw the prison’s operational procedures, including the systematic and brutal use of torture,” prosecutors said in a statement. “He was aware of the fact that prisoners were dying as a result of the massive application of violent force.” Gharib allegedly reported to Raslan, arresting protesters and delivering them to the Branch 251 jail. He is charged with a role in the abduction and torture of at least 30 people in the autumn of 2011. Raslan and Gharib left Syria in 2013 and entered Germany as asylum seekers in July 2014 and August 2018 respectively. Anwar Raslan came on to the radar of German investigators after a number of his alleged victims spotted him in Berlin and reported the sighting to authorities. After years of civilian deaths and suffering at the hands of multiple parties during the Syrian conflict, the first slow efforts to bring perpetrators to justice and dispel a sense of impunity are moving through national courts in several countries. Many have been driven by Syrian survivors, relatives, activists and lawyers, who have been collecting evidence and submitting criminal complaints across countries including Germany, Austria and Sweden. Documented crimes include the use of chemical weapons and torture, mass execution, Islamic State’s abduction and sexual enslavement of Yazidi women, and the targeted bombing of hospitals and other civilian installations. There has been no concerted international effort because Syria is not a party to the treaty that established the international criminal court, and Russia and China have vetoed efforts to mandate the ICC to set up a special tribunal for Syria. The German prosecutions were welcomed by human rights groups. “We are starting to see the fruits of a determined push by victims and others to achieve justice,” said Balkees Jarrah, senior counsel at Human Rights Watch. “Criminal cases in Germany and elsewhere in Europe are an important first step in puncturing the climate of impunity that has plagued Syria for far too long. Perpetrators should take note that an unprecedented volume of information is being gathered to help ensure they face justice, no matter how much time passes.” The Berlin-based European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, which helps victims of abuse in Syria and elsewhere, said seven Syrians would be co-plaintiffs in the case, as allowed under German law. “These charges send an important message to survivors of Assad’s system of torture,” said Wolfgang Kaleck of the ECCHR. “We will continue working to ensure that the main perpetrators of state torture under Assad are brought to justice – in Germany or elsewhere.” The trial, set to start in 2020, will be the first prosecution for state-sponsored torture in Syria. The group described it as “an important step in the fight against impunity”, and quoted an unnamed survivor of the Branch 251 saying the judicial process was a cause for hope. “This process in Germany gives hope, even if everything takes a long time and nothing happens tomorrow, or even the day after tomorrow. The fact that it continues at all gives us, as survivors, hope for justice. I am ready to testify,” the survivor said. German authorities have approached the cases under the legal principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows the prosecution of crimes in one country even if they happened elsewhere."
153,crime,"Knife crime is linked to Tory austerity, Sadiq Khan to say","The mayor of London is to say that serious youth violence, such as stabbings and shootings, is strongly connected to social exclusion and austerity, and that he has the extensive research to show the link. 
Sadiq Khan will say on Monday that deprivation, poor mental health, school exclusions and poverty, exacerbated by the Conservatives’ austerity spending cuts, are helping to drive a rise of 71% in violent incidents between 2012-13 and 2017-18. 
The mayor is expected to say at an event in south London: “The truth is if we allow children to be brought up in deprived conditions as a country, if we accept high rates of school exclusions, if we fail to tackle domestic and sexual violence, if we leave people in bad housing with a lack of employment and training opportunities, and if we decimate the very public services designed to support those most in need – as this government has systematically done – then crime is quite simply much more likely to flourish.” 
Among the statistics he relies upon are that every borough worst hit by violent youth offending had more children living in poverty than the average for London. Three-quarters of the boroughs in London with the highest levels of violent offending are also in the top 10 most deprived, and a quarter of all young Londoners live in the most deprived areas of the capital. The peak days for violence were Saturday and the early hours of Sunday morning. 
London’s Violence Reduction Unit conducted the research and the statistics are claimed to be the most detailed study of the causes of violent crime in the capital. Khan believes they show the need for a long-term public health approach, as well as strong enforcement in the short term.

Both main parties agree on the public health approach but Khan will say Tory austerity policies since 2010 boosted offending. “The sad reality is the violence we’re seeing on our streets today is an appalling side-effect of increasing inequality and alienation caused by years of government austerity and neglect,” he will say. 
“The lesson we must all learn is that you can’t cut police officers, public services, preventative measures and ignore the most vulnerable people in our country at the same time as keeping crime low. These things are fundamentally incompatible.” 
Some have blamed Khan for doing too little to combat rising violence, with one-third of all knife offences in England and Wales taking place in London, according to the Office for National Statistics. He has been attacked by Donald Trump, as well as the Conservatives. 
Next year Khan will run for re-election. So far the capital’s homicide rate and serious youth violence is marginally down in 2019, though public concern and attention on crime remains high. 
Linking violent criminal behaviour to poverty and social exclusion is risky for a politician, but the mayor will seek to head off criticism that he is excusing offending. “There’s never any excuse for criminality,” he will say. “Those who commit crimes must pay for their actions. But we have to face the reality that for some young people growing up today, violence has become normalised. 
“And – with hope at rock bottom, inequality higher than ever and an absence of positive opportunities – turning to crime and gangs has become an all too easy route to satisfy the lure of gaining respect and money – however misguided this is.” 
He will broadly back stop-and-search, which under his administration last year saw more African-Caribbean people stopped than white people, the vast majority of whom were found to have nothing on them warranting further investigation. Police say the racial mix of people stopped matches that of offenders and helps takes weapons off the streets. Khan will say: “I’ll continue to defend the tactics they’re successfully using to drive down violence, including targeted stop-and-search.” 
The research shows that serious youth violence victims recorded by police rose by 71% from 2012-13 to 2017-18, but fell by 4% in 2018-19. 
For the victims aged 10 to 16, attacks were linked to school finishing times, whereas for the victims aged 18 to 24, violence happened later and reflected the night-time economy. 
Measures Khan will announce include increased after-school provision in high-crime areas, action to lessen school exclusions, and support for vulnerable parents who have suffered abuse or domestic violence."

155,crime,‘They yelled Coronavirus’ – East Asian attack victim speaks of fear,"An east Asian man who was violently assaulted and robbed by two teenagers shouting “coronavirus” at him has warned that the spread of the disease has created “a climate of racism” in the UK. The attack on Pawat Silawattakun, a 24-year-old tax consultant, is thought to be the first violent hate crime linked to the virus reported to British authorities. Silawattakun says he was travelling home in the late afternoon to west London when he was attacked on his local high street in full view of dozens of passersby. The Thai man, who works in the City, was left stunned and bleeding with a broken nose as one assailant stole his headphones and the other filmed the attack on his phone. “I’d just got off the bus at Fulham when I heard a faint sound directed at me from my left across the street,” he told the Observer. “I had these noise-cancelling headphones on and took them off as these guys just shouted ‘Coronavirus! Coronavirus! Ha, ha!’ in my face while filming me. I didn’t get a chance to say anything – ‘Please stop’, or ‘Why are you doing this?’ – when one of them snatched the headphones from my neck.” Neither of the teenagers initially ran away but instead laughed at Silawattakun, he said. “It didn’t feel like a robbery at that point, it felt like bullying, a bit of messing around.” Things quickly escalated when he gave chase. “After about 50 metres, they ran across the road and I ran after [one of them] shouting: ‘Why are you doing this?’ When I reached the traffic island he turned round and punched me to the ground. There was blood everywhere.” Silawattakun says he shouted out to bystanders but “no one seemed to care or pay attention initially”. Eventually he was helped by two people and got an Uber to hospital. His attackers didn’t bother leaving the scene, so Silawattakun took pictures of them to pass to the police. “It’s made me very wary, it’s a terrible feeling knowing that they’re still out there. It isn’t just a robbery, there’s also knowing that I’ve been targeted because of my ethnicity, and that they were filming me to humiliate me, as if east Asians are all submissive and easy targets.” A global poll by Ipsos Mori on Friday found that 14% of respondents said they would avoid contact with people of Chinese origin or appearance. Silawattakun, who moved to England to attend boarding school in Surrey before reading chemical engineering at Cambridge, was despairing. “Statistically, you’re more likely to find an Asian doctor that will cure you than to find an Asian guy who will infect you with coronavirus, but this xenophobia is being taken out on all east Asians. When there was an Ebola outbreak a few years ago, did you get the public shouting ‘Ebola!’ at every black person on the street?” After posting about his attack on Facebook, Silawattakun said he received dozens of messages from people sharing their own experiences of hostile and racist behaviour in recent weeks.  Scotland Yard said: “Police are investigating an aggravated robbery committed in Fulham. The victim, a 24-year-old man, reported being racially abused by an unknown male suspect in Fulham Road, SW6. A second male suspect approached the victim from behind and stole his headphones and then assaulted him. The victim sustained a broken nose and received hospital treatment.” Silawattakun said his parents had flown from Thailand to support him. He is due to have an operation on his nose and has taken leave from work. “It doesn’t matter how much I’ve accomplished or how hard I’ve worked,” he said. “None of that shields me or anyone else. I’m still just a target because I’m east Asian.”"
156,crime,"Woman found dead in Parkville, Melbourne in 'horrendous crime'","A woman’s body has been found in Melbourne between the Melbourne Zoo and the Royal Children’s hospital, in what police have described as a “horrendous crime”. They have cordoned off a large section of the Royal park in Parkville, encompassing North Park Tennis Club and the Flemington Road Cricket Oval, as well as Elliott Avenue.  A significant amount of bushland runs through the cordoned-off area. The homicide squad detective inspector Andrew Stamper told reporters during a news conference on Saturday afternoon that the death was being treated as suspicious. The body was found about 9.15am by people walking their dogs, Stamper said. He urged anyone who was in the area overnight or early in the morning to come forward.     The police have cordoned off a large section of the Parkville park. Photograph: James Ross/AAP    “This is a horrendous crime, as all murders are,” he said. “Our focus will be on catching the perpetrator of this horrendous crime. Sadly at the moment we still don’t know who this female is, and we still don’t know the circumstance that brought her to the park or what happened.” A police helicopter was in the area on Saturday afternoon as homicide detectives and forensic police combed the area. “We really need the community’s help with this,” Stamper said. The police are yet to provide further details about the cause of the woman’s death. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000."
157,crime,Police investigate possible hate crime after slurs aimed at Megan Rapinoe,"New York City police are investigating a possible hate crime directed at Megan Rapinoe after posters of the World Cup champion were defaced with homophobic slurs. The defaced posters, which were at a Manhattan subway station, were reported early on Monday morning. The US had won the Women’s World Cup final on Sunday, and were given a victory parade in New York on Wednesday. Rapinoe, who is gay, finished as the top scorer in the tournament and is a vocal advocate for women’s and LGBT rights. She has also clashed with Donald Trump. Before the World Cup she said she would not visit the White House if the US won the tournament, and on Sunday she accused the president of excluding large sections of the US population. “Your message is excluding people. You’re excluding me. You’re excluding people that look like me. You’re excluding people of color. You’re excluding ... Americans that maybe support you,” she said on CNN. After the parade on Wednesday, Rapinoe preached a message of unity. “This is my charge to everyone: we have to be better,” she said. “We have to love more. Hate less. We got to listen more and talk less … It’s our responsibility to make the world a better place.   Related: What it's like covering Megan Rapinoe, the World Cup's most interesting star    A spokesperson for New York’s Metropolitan Transport Authority said they had referred the defaced posters to police. “Hate has no place in the transit system and we work hard to make the subway a welcoming, safe environment for everyone,” said in a statement. “We referred this to NYPD which responded to investigate, our maintenance teams got the posters cleaned and we will have them replaced with new ones if necessary.” The US team have been widely praised since winning their second World Cup in succession. After Wednesday’s parade they were named team of the year at the prestigious ESPY awards. However, there has been some backlash to Rapinoe and her teammates’ activism. On Wednesday, former Trump advisor Sebastian Gorka accused the team of attacking American values. “They’ve gone insane, and they want to destroy everything that is wholesome in our country and in our Judeo-Christian civilization,” he said."
158,crime,Police leaders urge next PM: reverse cuts to tackle violent crime,"Police leaders have written to the two Conservative leadership candidates to say whichever of them becomes prime minister should make providing more money to police and youth services their first priority. The letter from 10 Labour police and crime commissioners overseeing the four biggest forces, and others across England and Wales, was sent to Boris Johnson, who has said he wants to hire an extra 20,000 police officers, and Jeremy Hunt, who has said policing cuts have gone too far. Since 2010, police funding and officer numbers have fallen under the Conservatives, while provision of youth services has dramatically declined. In the letter, the police leaders say: “Violent crime has been rising across the country since 2014 after years of spending cuts. Across the country, these cuts have affected police numbers, as well as preventative services including youth services, local councils, mental health services and schools. “That’s why it’s encouraging to hear both the Conservative candidates to be the next prime minister accept the link between this government’s reductions in police numbers and rising crime levels, and admit that the cuts made by your government have gone too far.” A National Audit Office report in September 2018 said there had been a 19% drop in police funding since the Conservatives took power in a coalition government in 2010, and officers were struggling to maintain an effective service. The number of police officers and civilian staff has fallen from 244,497 in 2010 to 199,752, though the government says police are to receive an extra £970m in funding this year, a significant proportion of this from council tax. Because cuts fell hardest on poorer urban areas, bigger forces lost the most resources. In the letter, the police leaders stress the need for immediate action from the next prime minister. “Given it takes around nine months to fill a police vacancy, it is crucial that the funding is available as soon as possible, as any delay results in delays to recruitment and ultimately to communities waiting longer to see the benefits of additional policing,” they write. The letter says the next prime minister needs to back up government commitments to a public health approach to tackling violent crime with new resources. “While you have made pledges to invest in more policing, there has been no focus on addressing the root causes of crime. Cuts to youth services, local authority budgets, school budgets and mental health services have contributed to a worsening of inequality and poverty, and made efforts to prevent crime even more difficult,” the police leaders write. “That’s why we are asking you to commit to making this your first priority as prime minister and reverse the cuts made to policing and preventative services.” Their call is backed by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, the police and crime commissioners for the West Midlands and West Yorkshire respectively, David Jamieson and Mark Burns-Williamson, as well as Beverley Hughes, the Greater Manchester deputy mayor for policing, along with PCCs for six other areas."
159,crime,Victims of serious crime 'failed by London probation service',"“Wholly unsatisfactory” probation services in London are not giving enough support to victims of violent and sexual crimes, inspectors say. In at least one in five reviewed cases, victims of serious crime were not offered access to a statutory scheme that is supposed to keep them updated on offenders. The victim contact scheme (VCS) allows victims to find out about any changes to an offender’s sentence and when they will be released. Dame Glenys Stacey, the chief inspector of probation, said: “Some victims are not being offered a service at all, while others are receiving a service that is simply not good enough.” She said that after “significant, parliamentary and public interest” in the London service’s work, it was “deeply concerning to see that some victims of serious crime are still being failed”. The Ministry of Justice was criticised in 2018 when it initially granted parole to the serial sex attacker John Worboys. Worboys’ victims learned of the decision to release him from prison through the media. In its response to Stacey’s report, the MoJ said improvement was “clearly needed”. Inspectors gave the London branch of the National Probation Service (NPS), which manages more than 17,000 offenders, an overall rating of “requires improvement”. The NPS is a public body established in 2014 to oversee the supervision of high-risk offenders. The rest of probation services were outsourced to private companies known as community rehabilitation companies. Inspectors raised concerns about other aspects of the division’s work to protect the public. In one in five examined cases, the probation officer did not have regular enough contact with the offender they were supervising to “manage and minimise the risk of harm safely”. Staff shortages were partly blamed for the service’s shortcomings. The report noted that the London division had more than 150 unfilled job vacancies and was relying heavily on agency and temporary staff. Under the VCS scheme, victims of violent or sexual crimes can apply for licence conditions to be imposed on freed offenders to prevent them from making contact. Last week the government announced the probation sector would be renationalised in England and Wales, five years after Chris Grayling introduced widely criticised changes. An MoJ spokesperson said: “We have acted quickly to address these issues by creating a new dedicated victims’ forum to improve the quality of victim support, introducing new victim-specific training and recruiting across London, with 211 new staff joining over the past year.”"
160,crime,The best recent crime and thrillers – review roundup,"    The King’s Evil (HarperCollins, £14.99) is the third novel in Andrew Taylor’s superbly realised series set in 17th-century London and featuring government investigator James Marwood and his friend Cat Lovett, who is still distrusted because her father was one of those responsible for the execution of Charles I. The sequel to The Ashes of London and The Fire Court takes place in 1667 and finds the heirless Charles II busy “healing” the scrofulous populace – hence the title – while his court is a-buzz with aristocrats jockeying for position. Suspicion falls on Cat when the body of her cousin, Edward Alderley, is discovered in a well at the palatial home of a former royal favourite. Marwood, tasked with bringing her to justice, knows that she has motive, means and opportunity, but believes her to be innocent. Determined to clear her name, he treads a wary path through the various noble coteries and finds himself embroiled in a scandal. With plenty of intrigue and action, and a splendid portrait of Restoration society from the pomp of its royal court to the squalid camps of those left homeless after the great fire, this is historical crime fiction at its dazzling best.      Set in Kraków in 1893, Mrs Mohr Goes Missing by Maryla Szymiczkowa (Point Blank, £12.99, translated from Polish by Antonia Lloyd-Jones) is an altogether lighter affair, a throwback to the type of golden age fiction in which the police are unable to solve cases without the help of an obliging toff. Here, the meddlesome amateur sleuth is social climber Zofia Turbotyňska, who, in the course of organising a charity raffle at a local retirement home, stumbles on the mysterious disappearance of the eponymous widow. Her curiosity is further piqued when a second resident is found murdered and, aided by her faithful cook Franciszka, she begins to investigate. The waspish social one-upmanship – EF Benson in Mitteleuropa – may not be to everyone’s taste, but strong-minded Zofia is an appealing character and the sprightly narrative and vivid evocation of turn-of-the-century Poland make for an enjoyable tale.      There are shades of Agatha Christie’s And Then There Were None in Sleep (Avon, £12.99), the latest novel from CL Taylor. Although Anna is not technically responsible when the car she’s driving is involved in a collision that kills two of her colleagues and leaves a third with life-changing injuries, her feelings of guilt – exacerbated by anonymous cryptic messages – lead to insomnia. Wanting a fresh start, she accepts a job at a hotel on the remote Scottish island of Rum, but when the first seven guests arrive – on the very day the hotel is entirely cut off by a storm – it soon becomes clear that one of them is out for revenge … Tricksy and twisty, with some masterful misdirection and a brisk pace, Sleep is a pageturner that will keep you up way past your bedtime.      The past is also threatening to catch up with Marianne Thackeray, protagonist of Erin Kelly’s Stone Mothers (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, £12.99). As a teenager in Suffolk, she allowed her then boyfriend, Jesse, to bully her into blackmail. While both the victim and Marianne prosper over the next three decades, Jesse, who has never forgiven her for leaving their home town, has fared less well. When she returns, courtesy of husband Sam’s surprise purchase of a fancy pied-à-terre in a renovated former asylum, Jesse threatens to inform both Sam and their mentally fragile daughter of her past behaviour. With some uncomfortable truths about class divisions and how we care for those with mental health issues, Stone Mothers is atmospheric and poignant.      Chris Brookmyre, author of crime novels ranging through a wide spectrum of subgenres from comic to historical and science fiction, has now turned his considerable talents to the psychological thriller. Fallen Angel (Little, Brown, £18.99) centres on the disappearance of a toddler – now presumed dead – from the Portuguese holiday home of the high-achieving but profoundly dysfunctional Temples. The action is split between 2002, when the child went missing, and 2018, when the family regroup there after the death of grandfather Max, a celebrity debunker of unscientific theories. Yes, there’s a nod to Madeleine McCann here, but what this nuanced and intelligent novel is really about is the seductive nature of conspiracist thinking and the unholy brew of egotism, control, delusion and resentment that characterises toxic family relationships.      Missing teenager Kate narrates her own story in Call Me Evie (Sphere, £16.99), the debut novel from New Zealander JP Pomare. Hidden away in a rural community, she’s trying to escape from a controlling older man who claims that he is helping her evade the police after a violent incident, the details of which she cannot recall. Jim (not his real name) grows ever more paranoid as Kate slowly pieces together what really happened, but it isn’t entirely clear whom we should believe. Although there’s some clumsiness in the use of amnesia as a withholding device, excellent characterisation and the ability to conjure the cliquey, insecure adolescent world Kate left behind in Melbourne add up to an immersive and exciting read."
161,crime,Teenage detectives on the case as police seek knife crime answers,"A call comes through to DCI Steve Reardon. A 14-year-old boy has been stabbed in Liverpool. It’s serious, but he will survive. At this stage, there is no known suspect and the victim is refusing to cooperate. DCI Reardon, a seasoned detective in Merseyside police’s serious and organised crime unit, spurs his team into action. This is how most investigations begin. Last week the task of solving the crime fell to 15 teenagers, who were given the role of trainee detectives in a groundbreaking initiative aimed at steering vulnerable young people away from a life of crime. The youngsters, most aged 14 and from an area of Liverpool blighted by gangs, drugs and knives, began the week collecting their warrant cards before landing their first case. Over the course of a week, they interviewed the victim, his family and the chief suspect – all played by actors – and gathered enough evidence to take their investigation to court. Some of the boys were at first visibly uncomfortable around the police – or “bizzies”, as they called them – and sat with hunched shoulders, their coats zipped despite the stifling temperatures. But as the week progressed, the children relaxed. They managed to coax crucial intelligence from the victim, who reluctantly told them he had been “moving packages” for his associates when he was knifed. The next day, they picked out their chief suspect, Mick, in a Viper parade – police code for a digital ID parade. In interview, Mick denied being involved in the stabbing, insisting that he wasn’t in the area or driving a BMW that was spotted by the trainee detectives. His denials did not hold up in court, however. Under cross-examination by the barrister Ken Grant, 16-year-old Mick Keegan admitted lying to police before letting slip his dramatic confession, telling Liverpool crown court: “I done it because he was doing my head in – I didn’t mean for him to go to hospital!” The trainee detectives smiled self-consciously as their defendant was sentenced to three years in prison by the judge, Neil Flewitt QC, who praised them for their rigorous investigative work. Outside court, Harry, a 14-year-old nominated as the senior investigative officer, told the waiting media (the Guardian) he was very satisfied to put “Mick” behind bars. “It is a good result, getting dangerous people off the street.”     Pupils from schools across Merseyside taking part in a week-long activity at Merseyside police’s training academy in St Helens. Photograph: Colin McPherson/The Guardian    The initiative, run by Merseyside police and Everton in the Community, comes as police forces across the country grapple with ways to stem the soaring rise in knife crime across the country. Fatal stabbings are at their highest levels since records began in England and Wales, and the number of knife and offensive weapons offences has risen to its highest in nearly a decade. On Merseyside, knife crime has more than doubled since 2011, to 1,231 cases recorded by police in 2018 – a 35% jump on the previous year. The increase has not gone unnoticed by young people. “Around the corner from mine, it was all sectioned off a few weeks ago,” said Keira, 14, one of the youngsters involved in the trainee detective scheme. “It makes you realise how close it can be and you’re not as safe as you should be.” Harry said he had heard of kids his age carrying knives, but would not do it himself. The programme had made him realise the difficulties faced by police in solving violent crime, he said: “It’s harder for the police to get information than it is for a normal person.” Some of the youngsters involved in the programme have been identified as at risk of slipping into organised crime, such as county lines drugs gangs. The aim of the scheme, police say, is not to recruit the next generation of detectives, but to prevent them from falling into violence. They want these 15 youngsters to warn their schoolfriends about the brutal realities of gangs. “This is completely different to what my predecessors would ever have done,” said DCI Reardon. “The days of a police officer standing in front of young people wagging a finger are over.” Earlier this month a 12-year-old boy was arrested for stabbing a married gay couple, in what police described as a homophobic attack, as they walked home from a pub in the Anfield area of Liverpool. A week earlier a BBC report suggested that teenagers in the city were being offered £1,000 by gang leaders to stab other youngsters – an incident DCI Reardon insists was isolated and not part of a wider trend. On Sunday a young man, reported to be aged 21, was stabbed to death in broad daylight outside a shopping parade in the Kirkby area of the city. Rob Jackson, an emergency nurse clinician at the Royal Liverpool University hospital, showed the children a gruesome selection of images of some of the stabbings he had dealt with over his 20-year career: the severed hand of a man who owed £70 for drugs; a man with a £50 cannabis debt who was given a “Chelsea smile” – his cheeks sliced from the corners of his mouth.     The children learned about the principles of investigation and the difficulties of obtaining evidence. Photograph: Colin McPherson/The Guardian    There was another disturbing trend, he revealed, known as getting “bagged” – where victims are knifed deliberately in the bowel area so that they have to wear a colostomy bag. The chances of surviving a knife attack are purely down to luck, said Jackson, whether from a single stab wound or several. The brutal reality is underlined by the fact that the last eight under-18s fatally stabbed on Merseyside were killed by a single blow. Sam Cook was celebrating his 21st birthday when he was murdered with a single stab wound to the heart on a night out in Liverpool on 21 October 2017. His killer, who was on licence for stabbing another man with a machete, was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 28 years in prison last June. Cook’s parents, Gill Radcliffe and Alan Cook, should be watching Sam get engaged, married, go on holidays and have children. But last Friday, 20 months after his death, they interred his ashes beneath a headstone bearing his name. “We’ll never see him again and that’s that harsh reality of knife crime,” said Radcliffe in an emotional meeting with the youngsters in Liverpool last week.  The detective leading the Merseyside programme is DC Dominique Walker, whose brother Anthony was killed in one of the most high-profile race murders in Britain 14 years ago. Barely two months ago, Walker’s childhood friend, Bala Lloyd-Evans, was stabbed to death in Liverpool city centre on the night of the Champions League final. “The country is in a crisis for young people as we speak,” she said, adding that a string of “social harms” including austerity, cuts to youth programmes and cuts to education grants were driving children to violence. “This programme is a small cog in a number of different initiatives that should be taking place around the city and around the country,” she said. “It’s to save lives.”"
162,crime,Making a murder: true-crime stage show recreates a shocking killing,"On 22 April, 2012, Ihsane Jarfi left a gay bar in Liège, Belgium, and got chatting to a group of men in a Volkswagen Polo. At some point after they all drove off together, the 32-year-old Belgian Moroccan was tortured and killed. His naked body was found two weeks later showing evidence of hours of torture. A crime of such arbitrary viciousness and intolerance shocked the city. For theatremaker Milo Rau, it raises many questions, including whether art can create meaning out of such a meaningless act. “Can you give a story a sense of the tragic when it is total coincidence?” he asks. “These people are drunk, they meet Ihsane Jarfi, they go too far and they kill him, but it was never their intention. They didn’t plan to take him, they were searching for a girl. The question of the play is, ‘How can you give meaning to this complete coincidence?’” He’s only 42, but Rau is already one of the darlings of the European festival circuit for his provocations as well as his art. He put paedophilia in the spotlight in Five Easy Pieces, explored the Rwandan genocide in Hate Radio and attempted to cast real-life jihadists in Lam Gods, a show about religion. Relatively unseen in the UK, the Swiss sociologist turned theatremaker makes his Edinburgh international festival debut with La Reprise: Histoire(s) du Théâtre (I). It is performed by his International Institute of Political Murder and uses the raw material of the homophobic killing to question our attitudes to violence, both real and staged. “What we need is a collective ritual, which is theatre, that will somehow overcome the trauma of dying,” he says.     ‘If you have a crime you only have stories, you don’t have the truth’ … Milo Rau. Photograph: Michiel Devijver    In a hybrid of filmed interrogation and documentary re-enactment, Rau uses a cast of professionals and amateurs to get under the skin of Jarfi’s murder. There are ethical questions about turning a distressing true story into a night at the theatre. Rau, who made sure to involve those affected, including Jarfi’s ex-boyfriend and father, says he wouldn’t have gone ahead without their approval. “It depended a lot on the tolerance of these people,” he says. “But I told them: ‘This is not a historical or journalistic work, it’s a play. Somehow the case of your son will be changed so it can become a metaphor for what can happen to everybody.’” As well as being about violence, the play is about theatre itself. It’s called La Reprise because of the repeated nature of theatre. A performance designed to appear spontaneous is the result of the very opposite: hours of meticulous preparation. To achieve a sense of truth takes elaborate layers of fiction. “If you have a crime you only have stories,” says Rau. “You have the grief of the parents and you have perspectives, but you don’t have the truth. In the theatre you’re always repeating the emotion, repeating the facts. You’re killing on stage but everybody knows that the next day this actor has to act again. The question of how you come to a total, true fictionalisation is the basic question at the heart of theatre.” His interest in truth extends to the actors, casting “real” amateurs as well as professionals. In this show, he casts Johan Leysen, a major player whose CV ranges from Jean-Luc Godard to TV shows including Spiral and The Missing, alongside first-timers. The influence works both ways: the amateur actors adopt professional standards, while the professionals are challenged by the lived experience of the amateurs. “When you’re talking about the killing of Ihsane Jarfi, the people on stage knew him and live in Liège, and that changes the point of view,” he says. “It changes the act of acting.” Doesn’t all this theatre about theatre get very circular? As Leysen says towards the start of the play: “Acting is like delivering a pizza. It’s not about the delivery man. It’s about the pizza.” Could Rau himself be more interested in the delivery man? He’s in two minds: “When you stage a Shakespeare play for the 500th time, then of course it’s about the actor and the act of delivering.”   Related: Sex, sheep and terror: the scandalous theatre of Milo Rau    In practice, the production is both things. It is about the representation of violence as well as the violence itself. “Heiner Müller said theatre is a dialogue with the dead,” says Rau. “It’s a dialogue going only in the one direction. What we can do by delivering, by doing this ritual again and again, is talk to the dead and perhaps they will hear you. If the public will just be present watching this ritual between the living and the dead … on the one hand it’s just delivering pizza, on the other hand it’s an antique, beautiful and tragic experience. I like there being a lot of meta in the show but I also like it being direct and emotional.”  La Reprise: Histoire(s) du Théâtre (I) is at the Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, 3–5 August. "
163,crime,"First Thing: Who stops funding WHO in a pandemic? Donald Trump, that's who","Good morning, 
In the midst of an unprecedented global health crisis, Donald Trump has decided to cut US funding to the World Health Organization after accusing the international body of “severely mismanaging and covering up” the threat posed by the coronavirus. Leading health experts described the president’s move as “damnable”, “appalling” and “a crime against humanity”. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
For context, the WHO declared a public health emergency on 30 January – after which the president continued to hold mass rallies and compare Covid-19 to the common flu. On Tuesday, Trump complained the WHO had “defended the actions of the Chinese government, even praising its so-called transparency”. On 24 January, Trump tweeted his thanks to the Chinese for their work on the virus, praising their “efforts and transparency”. 
Trump targeted the WHO, Julian Borger writes from Washington, because he needed someone else to blame for his administration’s own complacent and dysfunctional response to the crisis: 
 
 How well Trump’s scapegoating of the WHO will play in the US election is impossible to predict, but on the world stage it will undoubtedly be seen as yet another step in an accelerating US abdication of global leadership. 
 
 
 Female reporters. The women of the White House press corps really seem to get under the president’s skin, as evidenced by his testy exchange with CBS’s Paula Reid. Poppy Noor asks whether Trump has met his match in the briefing room. 
 Presidential cheques. Trump’s own name will appear on the $1,200 cheques being sent to cash-strapped Americans amid the crisis – so they’ll know who to blame when the cheques arrive several days later than expected.

California is transitioning to the “optimistic” phase of its coronavirus response, Governor Gavin Newsom suggested on Tuesday, but don’t expect those stay-at-home orders to be lifted anytime soon. A Stanford epidemiologist has pooh-poohed any speculation of statewide “herd immunity”, while San Francisco has cancelled its 50th anniversary Pride event, which had been due to take place at the end of June. Several experts say physical distancing may be needed intermittently until at least 2022.

164,crime,New Zealand passes landmark law to decriminalise abortion,"New Zealand has passed a landmark bill to decriminalise abortion after decades of campaigning. Andrew Little, the justice minister, said it was long overdue that the procedure would become classified as a health matter and not a criminal one. The issue was scheduled to be put to a public referendum, but the government scrapped that option late on Wednesday. “For over 40 years, abortion has been the only medical procedure considered a crime in New Zealand. But from now abortions will be rightly treated as a health issue,” Little said in a statement. “The previous law required a women seeking an abortion to go through many hoops. That resulted in delays to access a procedure, and that was less safe. The changes agreed to by parliament will better ensure women get advice and treatment in a more timely way.” Key elements of the bill that passed through parliament included removing abortion from the Crimes Act, allowing women to choose abortion up to 20 weeks after consultation with a GP, and promoting counselling options for women choosing an abortion. Terry Bellamak, the director of Alranz Abortion Rights Aotearoa, celebrated the move, saying it heralded a progressive step forward for New Zealand. “Finally the New Zealand parliament has brought abortion legislation into the 21st century – it only took 44 years,” Bellamak said. “Finally after 44 years, New Zealand parliament has recognised that women have bodily autonomy – and that is huge. Being able to control one’s fertility is key to one’s life – it is hard to see how we could achieve equality without that.” Previously under New Zealand law, abortion was allowed only in cases of incest, “mental subnormality” or foetal abnormality, or where the physical or mental health of the mother was at serious risk. Other factors that were taken into consideration but were not grounds in themselves included “sexual violation” and “extremes of age”.  Jail terms of up to 14 years for those who procured a termination were possible under the Crimes Act, but the law was never enforced and women who underwent abortions were not liable for prosecution. But Little said the change was nevertheless needed. "
165,crime,"The philosophical crime writer: 'You must have empathy, even for the worst criminals'","There was a time when it wouldn’t be safe to be sitting at a table with Gianrico Carofiglio. A time when he would not be out in the open like this. A time when, for five years, he travelled by armoured car, escorted by many heavily armed bodyguards. When his every move was planned with military precision. There’s not a lot of personal freedom when you are an anti-mafia judge. In some ways Carofiglio was as caged as the men he was putting into prison. There were plots against him, one involving a bazooka. There was the haunting precedent of the murders of Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino – two judges who had fought the Sicilian mafia and were killed when their cars were blown up in 1992. He carried a gun for so long that when he decided to stop some years ago he kept forgetting it wasn’t there: “I was always reaching for it … it was such a long time that I was carrying that gun.” It was only recently that he surprised himself by sitting in a restaurant with his back to the entrance. “It was at that moment that I knew, OK, it’s over, I don’t feel unsafe any more.”   Related: US mafia explosives expert 'helped Sicilian mob kill judge'    Carofiglio has put hundreds of mafioso into prison, first as a judge, then becoming a prosecutor: “I feel more like a cop in my soul.” He was appointed an adviser of the anti-mafia committee in the Italian parliament in 2007 and then served as a senator for the leftist Democratic party from 2008 to 2012, three of those years in opposition to Berlusconi (“That was the funniest period,” he says, “because we could exercise our creativity in opposition.”) Since 2002 he has been writing crime novels, at first in his spare time, starring a recurring main character, a widely-read, jazz-loving philosophical prosecutor who thinks deeply about good and evil (he has retired this character now). In total he has sold more than 4m copies. He had wanted to write since he was a child, but didn’t until he was in his 40s: “I was so scared of trying I thought I had better really try and understand this problem.” It took nine months to write Involuntary Witness; he had already lived the material. “And then I had my answer, it sold over a million copies all over the world.” He’s a full-time writer now, and anyone watching him work, says Carofiglio, would think he was “crazy. I can sit writing for maybe six or seven minutes and then I have to stand up and do something and sit again for five minutes, I pour some coffee, I do some exercises, I check emails and then write again. It is very tiring by the end of the day I have done what I had to do.” Born in Bari, southern Italy, in 1961, he still practises martial arts and karate which he learned with kids from “the most dangerous parts of the city”, some of whom he would later arrest, “a very strange unpleasant feeling, of course”. Still, he doesn’t believe the poverty in the south the alleged lack of any other choice, is an excuse for the criminal activity. “It is not totally about poverty,” he says. “Often, not always, criminality is a choice. The social issue is important but it is not the only thing thing to understand of why a boy becomes a criminal. Many of the ones that became a real problem came from good working families.” He does agree that the mafia grew out of the chroniclawlessness, from a time before unification, “a lack of state authority. The south had been ruled for a long, long time by different foreign countries. That means that the population didn’t learn the attitude or respect for legal power because they didn’t feel they belonged to the state or its rules. If they had a problem they didn’t go to a legal tribunal. They went to the boss.”    You must be able to use empathy even with the worst criminals, to see the world through their eyes  Gianrico Carofiglio     Few people have more insight into the mafia mentality, the inner workings of Italy’s organised crime, than someone whose job as a prosecutor was to interrogate men (rarely women) who had been arrested. To be good at this, says Carofiglio, you have to have empathy. “You must be able to use this even with the worst criminals, to see the world through their eyes. This is not sympathy; they are two different words. The worst cops and prosecutors are the ones who have a tendency towards moral judgment because that is very dangerous. It can interfere with your work and obscure your vision.” He has learned “some things about how a normal person becomes a criminal, then something more than a criminal. I was very raw when I started but I found out the world is much more complicated than the separation between good and evil. Many of these guys are like us. You find good ones and really bad ones and some bad ones who are nice people. You find good criminals who are people who did bad things because they needed a job, but didn’t enjoy it.”     Gianrico Carofiglio at the Byron writers festival this month. Photograph: Kurt Petersen/The Guardian    Then there are the ones who “like this kind of life, the money, the power. When we talk about mafia crimes we talk about rational crimes. They are done for commercial and technical reasons, for disturbing a business.” At the Byron writers festival he was talking about his book, The Cold Summer, a barely fictionalised account of events in 1992, when it was all-out war. “I don’t like to call it a war because the correct frame should be we are the public and they are criminals; we are not fighting you, we are catching you. The very idea of a fight includes an idea of legitimisation. But at that time they were so powerful it was a war.” He was a young prosecutor then, in 1992, in Puglia. Using transcripts of people he had interviewed throughout his career, central to the story is a “justice co-operator” who is snitching for protection from a boss he has betrayed. And Carofiglio has laid it all out, as it happened, as it was. The crude savagery, paranoid cocaine-snorting bosses, the thuggery, the using fear to gain power. Blood was running through the picturesque white-washed Puglian villages. Where the sea is the deepest blue and the farms centuries old, there was endless, endless killing.   Related: FBI and Italian police arrest 19 people in Sicily and US in mafia investigation    At the same time as the judges were bombed in Palermo, the Puglian gangs were rising, having organised in prison for self-defence against harassment by the Neapolitan Camorra: “When they finished their time and came out in the 90s we had a huge problem.” Petty criminals had now become the sort of people who enslaved prostitutes and sold their babies - a syndicate he busted. He wrote this book because he wanted people to know the “truth about what happened in my country”. He is infuriated by the glamorising, the mythologising, of a strutting, spiv-suited mafia in films, television, books. “It is wrong to create mafia guys as heroes,” he says. “The idea of an almighty mafia that is invincible and can do whatever they want is false. The Sopranos, the Godfather, this is not real life. They look like very smart people. This is simply not true. People think they are untouchable. This is not true. They are perfectly touchable and in fact we have touched them very hard. It is just sexier from a media point of view to think of poor cops and prosecutors trying to catch them and not succeeding.” The truth is that “the real world is without glamour and is just full of shit and blood. You don’t find nobility; you don’t find honour.” The Sicilian Cosa Nostra were once the most powerful criminal organisation in the world. After the devastation of the bombings the state struck hard. “From a strategic point of view it is a stupid thing for a criminal group to do to murder a judge or a prosecutor or a cop because you provoke an incredibly strong reaction,” says Carofiglio. It was the beginning of the end of Cosa Nostra: “They were kings, but something people don’t usually know is that all the important bosses have been caught, are in prison, have died, or will die in prison. We have prosecuted and convicted thousands of these people. We won this battle.”"
166,crime,Victoria abolishes public drunkenness as a crime ahead of death in custody inquest,"The Victorian government has announced a plan to abolish the crime of public drunkenness four days ahead of an inquest into the death in custody of Yorta Yorta woman Tanya Day, who was arrested on the summary charge. In its place will be a “health-based approach” that will “promote therapeutic and culturally safe pathways to assist alcohol-affected people in public places”, a government statement said. The state attorney general, Jill Hennessy, made the announcement on Thursday night and said she would write to the Victorian coroner, Caitlin English, who is overseeing the three-week inquest into Day’s death, to advise her that the government had committed in principle to abolishing the crime. English warned the government in December that she intended to recommend the law be abolished, and Day’s family has been advocating for the change since her death in December 2017.   Related: Death in custody prompts push to change Victoria's public drunkenness laws    “Public drunkenness requires a public health response, not a criminal justice one, and now is the right time to take this important reform forward,” Hennessy said. “The Andrews Labor government acknowledges the disproportionate impact the current laws have had on Aboriginal people and pay tribute to the community members who have advocated for this change.” Day was arrested and charged with being drunk in public on 5 December 2017, after a V/Line officer called police when she fell asleep on a train from Echuca to Melbourne. She was taken to Castlemaine police station and placed in the cells to “sober up”, but hit her head and sustained a brain haemorrhage that led to her death in hospital on 22 December. The inquest begins on Monday.  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning        In a statement, Day’s family said that while they welcomed the news, it ought not have cost their mother’s life. “In the end it took the death of our mother for the government to repeal laws that should have been abolished 30 years ago after the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody,” they said. “The government’s commitment is a great first step, but they need to back their words with action and repeal the law quickly so that no other Aboriginal person dies in custody.” Day’s daughter, Belinda Stevens, told Guardian Australia in an extended interview that she did not want to see the law repealed only to be replaced by another provision. She cited open container laws and aggressive protective custody provisions in other jurisdictions which mean that Aboriginal people were still effectively being arrested for public drunkenness. A relevant case was the death of Day’s uncle, Harrison Day, who had a seizure in the cells of the Echuca police station in 1982 after being arrested for an unpaid fine for being drunk and disorderly. Stevens urged the government to take a “health and wellbeing based approach”.   Related: ‘Police shouldn’t be investigating police’: family anger over death in custody inquest    The health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said the new model would be about “support, not punishment”, and the Aboriginal affairs minister, Gavin Jennings, praised Day’s family. “The courage and determination they have shown to prevent other families from experiencing their pain has been remarkable and truly inspiring,” he said. An expert panel of the Victorian Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation chief executive, Helen Kennedy, the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service chief executive, Nerita Waight, and the former Brotherhood of St Laurence executive director Tony Nicholson has been convened to consult with the Aboriginal community and other affected groups and draft an appropriate model. The Human Rights Law Centre, which is representing the family at Monday’s inquest, said it was “terrific news”. “If somebody is too drunk, they should be taken home, or to somewhere safe,” the centre’s legal director, Ruth Barson, said. “We’re now looking to the coronial inquest for answers on how an Aboriginal woman went from safely sleeping on a train to dying in police custody, and who should be held responsible for this tragic death.”  "
167,crime,MI5 policy allowing informants to commit serious crimes ruled lawful,"MI5’s partially secret policy allowing agents and informants to participate in serious crimes is lawful, judges have ruled by a three-to-two majority. In a 56-page judgment, the investigatory powers tribunal (IPT), which hears legal complaints about the intelligence agencies, declared that the guidelines do not breach human rights or grant absolute immunity to those who commit offences such as murder or torture. It is the first time the IPT has published dissenting judgments, both of which in this case are highly critical of the statutory framework surrounding the handling of agents. Many of the key arguments turned on the exploitation of informants within the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries during Northern Ireland’s Troubles. The coalition of civil liberty groups that brought the challenge – Reprieve, the Pat Finucane Centre, Privacy International and the Committee for the Administration of Justice – announced immediately they would appeal. Opening the majority judgment, Lord Justice Singh, Lord Boyd and Sir Richard McLaughlin acknowledged: “This case raises one of the most profound issues which can face a democratic society governed by the rule of law.” Lawyers for the civil liberty organisations argued that what is known as the “third direction” – guidelines permitting agents to become involved in criminal conduct, which were revealed in March 2018 – were illegal. Crucial details of the guidelines specifying whether there are limits on such criminal activity remain secret. Part of the IPT hearing was held behind closed doors with the media and lawyers for the claimants excluded. The tribunal has also published a secret or “closed” version of its final judgment. Explaining that the third direction guidelines are still not published in full, the majority judgment states: “For the reasons which are set out in our closed judgment, there is no more of the text of the guidelines which can properly be put into the public domain.” Maya Foa, Reprieve’s director, said: “The IPT’s knife-edge judgment, with unprecedented published dissenting opinions, shows just how dubious the government’s secret policy is. Our security services play a vital role in keeping this country safe, but history has shown us time and again the need for proper oversight and common sense limits on what agents can do in the public’s name.” Dr Ilia Siatitsa, a legal officer at Privacy International, said: “Today the investigatory powers tribunal decided that MI5 can secretly give informants permission to commit grave crimes in the UK, including violence. But two of its five members produced powerful dissenting opinions, seeking to uphold basic rule of law standards. “We think the bare majority of the IPT got it seriously wrong. We will seek permission to appeal to protect the public from this abusive secretive power.” The majority decision said: “[European] convention [of human] rights issues do not arise as a matter of substance in this challenge to the policy of the security service .… The events of recent years, for example in Manchester and London in 2017, serve vividly to underline the need for such intelligence-gathering and other activities in order to protect the public from serious terrorist threats. “It is not the effect of either [MI5’s] submissions or the judgment of the majority in this tribunal that the security service has the power to confer any immunity from the ordinary criminal law of this country or the civil law.” The security service, known as MI5, has issued guidelines on the use of agents who participate in criminality, the judgment points out, which say that representations are made to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service about whether criminal charges would be in the public interest. The guidelines state that official authorisation does not confer immunity but instead act as “the service’s explanation and justification of its decision should the criminal activity of the agent come under scrutiny by an external body, eg the police or prosecuting authorities”. “In particular, the authorisation process and associated records may form the basis of representations by the service to the prosecuting authorities that prosecution is not in the public interest.” In the first dissenting decision, Charles Flint QC said: “I entirely accept the operational necessity for the service to run agents who may need to participate in serious criminal activity.” However, he added, the policy under challenge “has been exercised with scrupulous care by the security service so as to discharge its essential functions in protecting national security, whilst giving proper regard to the human rights of persons who may be affected by the activities of agents”. But, he concluded he was “unable to find that the 1989 [Security Service] Act provides any legal basis for the policy under challenge”. Flint said the existing law left agents and handlers “unduly exposed” and “cannot be regarded as being in accordance with the law under the European convention on human rights”. In the second dissenting judgment, Prof Graham Zellick QC, was more critical, arguing that parliament had never authorised such a policy. And he added: “To accede to [MI5’s] argument would open the door to the lawful exercise of other powers of which we have no notice or notion, creating uncertainty and a potential for abuse.” During the hearing, Ben Jaffey QC, representing the coalition of civil liberty groups, said the policy in effect meant that MI5 was granting immunity to its agents. He pointed out that police have recently recommended that more than 20 people, including senior officials, should be prosecuted for murder, kidnap, torture and perverting the course of justice following an investigation by Operation Kenova into the handling of agents inside the IRA during Northern Ireland’s Troubles."
168,crime,Perspective on black knife crime,"It is acknowledged that columnists like Afua Hirsch (Rod Liddle is wrong about black deaths, 16 January) write stuff that is a reflection of their views; what is harder to accept is when those views are informed only by intellectual or prejudicial positions. Both Hirsch and Liddle arrive at conclusions about the causes of black teenage deaths (predominantly in London) without having had adequate (or perhaps any) experience of this tragedy on the ground. Although the majority of black boys in London achieve well in school and thereafter, a few things cannot be denied: black boys in London are massively over-represented in stabbings; black-on-black violence is significantly gang-related; gangs in London are crime-focused; the age of recruitment and grooming of young people for gang activity is dropping to primary school levels. Poverty and deprivation (of life chances and opportunity) can drive boys and young men into violent criminal activity. When male role models for these boys are neighbourhood gang elders (often replacing absent fathers) and a “gangsta” culture prevails, the boys stand little chance of escaping. Agencies must collaborate and intervene. When they do, and if it’s done right, the success and achievement of these young people can be breathtaking. Without exception, there are no lost causes, as long as we keep them alive.Julian Lee(Executive headteacher in east London, 2010-2018), Winchester, Hampshire • Afua Hirsch is right to focus on the self-blaming narrative that has taken hold in some sections of the black community in relation to knife crime and black-on-black violence. However, when she states “most violent crime is conducted by white people and the majority of stabbing victims in Britain are white. But as long as any black children are tragically dying on the streets, it is hugely important to debate the causes”, she buys into the same narrative. Black-on-black violence is a myth created by a section of the law and order lobby to facilitate an acceptance by the black community of intrusive policing techniques. The causes of black-on-black knife crime are the same as those of white-on-white knife crime – but we do not speak of white-on-white violence. Knife crime results from fear, social insecurity, and the development of a drugs-based counter-economy which fills the gaps caused by austerity. We should focus on the issue of knife crime per se and abandon the racialisation of it (not least because it is important to debate the causes whoever is the victim). The construct of black-on-black crime was developed to allow Operation Trident a foothold in the black community. Operation Trident was initially focused on supposed Yardie gun violence– another racialised policing construct. It has been repackaged to deal with black-on-black crime – a term which implies there is something peculiarly pathological about crime within the black community.Nick MossLondon • In article after weary article, Afua Hirsch depicts a cold-hearted, white supremacist Britain which is simply not the one I see around me. My friend in her nineties is being looked after in a care home by a young black man with all the tenderness and devotion of a son. Recently, a group of older people, black and white, some disabled, were enjoying a day in the park, having a laugh and looking out for one another. Kids of all races from my local primary school walk past me holding hands. And I doubt if my black and Asian friends bother to think of me as a white, middle-class, fairly privileged male, indelibly tainted by the criminal legacy of post-imperial Britain. We’re just friends, just people. Sure the garden isn’t always rosy, sure there’s a long way to go and we must always stand up against the racists and the bigots, but all Hirsch seems to see is oppression and injustice wherever she turns. To use that old cliche, what brings us together is greater than what divides us. So much of Hirsch’s writing makes her the problem rather than the solution.Alan ClarkLondon • Much as I sometimes wish Mr Liddle would moderate his views, do not stop journalists like him, Jeremy Clarkson and Melanie Phillips raising uncomfortable topics because, if we are not careful, they become “no go” areas for debate. Views that cannot be aired just fester and become the boils that are now perhaps being very painfully lanced. I am of course thinking of such things as immigration and grooming gangs, which we are sometimes discouraged from talking about for the sake of political correctness.Linda MarriottLincoln • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

169,crime,'Blanket secrecy' surrounds Australian weapons sales to countries accused of war crimes,"Australian companies are selling weapons and military technology to countries around the world accused of war crimes, but the Australian government has refused to say what weapons are being sent overseas and to whom. Nearly 100 permits were issued to export weapons and military technology to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka and the Democratic Republic of Congo over the 2018-2019 financial year. But the Australian defence department has refused to reveal how many weapons have been sold, for how much, or for what purpose. The extent of and extreme secrecy surrounding Australia’s foreign weapons sales are revealed by documents obtained by the Guardian under freedom of information laws.   Related: Australia's arms deals unaacceptable on moral grounds, former defence official says    Save for their existence and confirmation of country of destination, the documents are almost entirely redacted by the government, which has argued the information is commercial-in-confidence. That decision is being challenged by the Guardian. Between June of 2018 and July 2019, Australia issued 45 weapons export permits to the United Arab Emirates, 23 to Saudi Arabia, 14 to Sri Lanka and four to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Some of the weapons permits are extraordinarily detailed. One single permit, for a weapons technology export, runs to 403 pages, and contains hundreds of items. All of these details are redacted by the defence department. Nearly $5bn worth of declared value defence permits were issued by Australia in 2018-19, a dramatic increase on the $1.6bn approved the previous year.     Redacted pages from The Guardian’s freedom of information request regarding Australia’s defence exports for 2018-19. More than 1,200 pages have been heavily redacted regarding exports to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Sri Lanka.   The UAE’s military, whose Presidential Guard is commanded by retired Australian army major general Mike Hindmarsh, has been accused of war crimes in the brutal conflict in Yemen, where a coalition of UAE, Saudi and Yemeni government military forces are engaged in a bitter battle with Houthi rebels believed to be backed by Iran. Saudi Arabia’s military has led the coalition fighting in the five-year conflict, which has been plagued by human rights abuses including hospitals being bombed, civilians being targeted by shelling and sniper fire, civilian populations being deliberately starved, medical supplies being blocked, rape, murder, enforced disappearances, torture, and forcing children to fight. Australian weapons systems manufacturer Electro Optics Systems (EOS) – which supplies the Saudi military with remote weapon stations – has told the Guardian their equipment does not cross the border into Yemen. But a report by a United Nations panel of experts, including former Australian MP and international lawyer Melissa Parke, said countries who supplied weapons to the militaries of the UAE or Saudi Arabia could be complicit in war crimes being committed in the Yemen conflict. The Sri Lankan military has been accused of war crimes over several years and complicity in the continued disappearance, abuse and torture of Tamil citizens, democracy activists, journalists and opponents of the government. Recently re-elected prime minister, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, led the military at the conclusion of the country’s civil war: the 2009 operation to end the war left up to 40,000 civilians dead, according to a UN experts’ report. The current head of the military, Shavendra Silva, led the Sri Lankan army’s 58 Division unit in 2009, which was accused of intentional and indiscriminate attacks on civilians, no-fire zones and hospitals. The Democratic Republic of Congo has had a number of arms embargoes imposed upon it since 2003 because of a supply of weapons fuelling mass killings, human rights abuses and torture. The government’s military was previously included in sanctions banning the supply of all arms and related material, but was removed from the sanctions list in 2008. Arms embargoes still apply to non-government forces. All exports of arms require licences from the defence department’s export controls branch. The department has previously told Senate estimates that export licences are not issued if the weapons are likely to be used in human rights abuses. “If we assess that they would be used [to commit human rights abuses], we would not approve the permit,” Tom Hamilton, then acting deputy secretary of the defence department’s strategic policy and intelligence group, said in February. Defence says it runs rigorous risk assessments on weapons prior to export. That process involves examining human rights, Australia’s international obligations, foreign policy, national security and regional security.   Related: Australia's generous aid to Yemen mustn't be undermined by its weapons sales | Jason Lee    “This assessment includes consideration of whether there is an overriding risk that the exported items could be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law,” a spokeswoman said last year. Dr Margaret Beavis, vice president of the Medical Association for Prevention of War, said it was well past time for the defence department’s “notorious secrecy” around Australian arms sales to end. “If Australia is complying with all its legal obligations, as defence claims, what have they got to hide? This claim that they are protecting the commercial interests of weapons sellers is woefully insufficient justification for the blanket secrecy surrounding Australian weapons sales to nations accused of war crimes.” Freedom of information expert Peter Timmins said failing to tell the Australian public which countries the government was exporting arms to was “quite remarkable”, given former defence minister Christopher Pyne was open about his intention to sell arms to Saudi Arabia. “Having put on the public record that we intend to increase our arms sales to a country like Saudi Arabia, to then not disclose that we might have issued an export permit to enable the export of arms to Saudi Arabia seems quite remarkable,” he told the Guardian. Timmins is concerned the spirit and intent of the FoI Act are increasingly being disregarded in favour of secrecy. “The proper test of the act is to make information available promptly that goes to accountability, transparency, good government, or poor government as the case may be,” he said."
170,crime,Queensland police officer allegedly took photo of family violence victim's private details,"A Queensland police superintendent has been suspended for allegedly photographing the confidential details of a domestic violence victim, Guardian Australia has learned. The senior detective is the second officer in Queensland known to be accused of using police computer systems to obtain details related to a domestic violence complainant. He is also one of the highest ranking officers to be caught up in an ongoing data misuse scandal, which the state’s police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, has said has “brought our organisation into disrepute”.   Related: Woman prosecutes former partner who doused her with petrol in case Queensland police refused    The man had been seconded to a role at the Crime and Corruption Commission Queensland last year. In early November, police and the CCC both released statements that said the 51-year-old detective superintendent had been stood down from operational duties, then suspended, amid an ongoing investigation into the unauthorised access of confidential information. The CCC immediately rescinded the man’s secondment. The statements made no mention of the specific allegations. But Guardian Australia can reveal the officer was suspended for allegedly taking a photograph of a computer screen displaying the personal details of a domestic violence complainant. Police said they “proactively” released a statement two days after the CCC had done so, but would not address questions about why the statement did not mention the accusations related to the identity of a domestic violence complainant. At the time the officer was stood down, police were under extraordinary scrutiny in relation to their handling of a similar incident – senior constable Neil Punchard accessed the address of a domestic violence victim and disclosed the details to her former partner. Police initially treated Punchard’s actions as an internal disciplinary matter. He was docked pay but not demoted or dismissed. After considerable public pressure, a campaign from the victim and advice from the CCC, police eventually laid charges against Punchard and he was convicted of computer hacking last year. Carroll remains under pressure to sack him. In November last year, the same week the detective superintendent was suspended, the CCC began hearings into Operation Impala, which was investigating public sector data misuse. The CCC eventually recommended tougher criminal sanctions for public officials who access confidential information unlawfully, after hearing evidence that agencies were often inconsistent in deciding whether to handle breaches as criminal complaints or internal discipline matters.   Related: 'Failure in our system': after Hannah Clarke and her children's murder, experts call for action    On 18 November, when giving evidence at the inquiry, Carroll was asked whether criminal charges should be pursued in circumstances where a domestic violence victim’s details were disclosed. “Yes, and that’s a strong message that I have sent,” she said. Several people with knowledge of the case have spoken to Guardian Australia out of concern at the time it has taken to investigate the case.  Police said the investigation into the detective superintendent “remains ongoing and as such, the QPS is unable to comment further at this time”. It is understood he is on full pay while suspended."
171,crime,How Tasnim Lowe survived the death of her family – and the truth of her father’s horrific crime,"Tasnim Lowe was 16 months old when she was found under the apple tree where her father had left her, wrapped in a blanket. Behind her, the house in Telford, Shropshire, where her mother, aunt and grandparents lived was on fire and would soon be totally gutted. Her 16-year-old mother, Lucy, who was pregnant again, her 17-year-old aunt, Sarah, and their mother, Linda, were killed; Lowe’s grandfather, George, managed to escape. The following year, 2001, Lowe’s father, Azhar Ali Mehmood, was convicted of three charges of murder and one of attempted murder. Eighteen years on, he is seeking parole, with a hearing likely to take place in the next couple of weeks. The case – and Lowe’s attempts to understand why her father committed such a crime – is now the subject of three powerful BBC Three films. Made over more than a year, the series follows Lowe as she uncovers the horrific truth about her parents’ “relationship”. We meet at her flat in Telford. Lowe is small and slight and looks younger than 20. But when she speaks, she is so articulate and independent that she seems older. There is a tiny hint of a burn scar just above her cheekbone. Doing the documentary, she says, “did take a toll on my mental health because [I had] to take in so much information, and process it … Now I can look back on what I learned and understand it better.” She smiles. “But at the time it was terrible.” Last year, Lowe was contacted by the Mirror journalist Geraldine McKelvie, who was investigating child sexual exploitation (CSE) rings operating in Telford at the time Lowe’s family were killed. Lowe’s mother’s case seemed to fit the pattern – she was 13 when she met Mehmood, a taxi driver nearly 10 years older than her, and 14 when she became pregnant. Chillingly, other girls in Telford had told McKelvie that, at the time, Lucy’s murder was used as a threat against speaking out. This was all new to Lowe.     Tasnim, aged three, with her grandfather, George, who cared for her after her mother was killed. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian    That story led to this BBC documentary. Making it, she says, “was good, because I wanted to know everything I possibly could about the case. But at times, there were things that I couldn’t …” She pauses. “Certain things I still can’t get over.” She means details about the relationship between her parents. Miraculously, during the filming, the police handed back Lucy’s diaries – Lowe had not known they existed. In them, Lucy had written about going to a place notoriously used by grooming rings and performing sex acts on older men. Yet there was also some comfort in the new information. Lowe was raised by her grandfather (although she also lived with other family members and was in foster care for a few years as a teenager). This was a man who had lost his wife and both daughters, who suddenly had a baby to look after. “My granddad tried his best,” she says and “growing up with him was really good, but I didn’t really understand why he was always unhappy. If you met him, you can tell that he’s had a lot of hurt in his life. So it was interesting learning about what type of person he was [before], with his family, being so bubbly and happy. I feel like it’s brought me and him closer.” Lowe was too young to remember anything of her mum. All she had while she was growing up were a few photos, a bit burnt and crumbling. There was just one of the mother and daughter together. She doesn’t remember ever being told what had happened, but she grew up with some knowledge of the facts – that her father had killed her mother, aunt and grandmother. “All I remember was that my mum was in heaven and my dad was far away. And that my dad wasn’t a nice person.”  She knew people had said that her parents’ relationship “was a bit iffy” but she never gave their age gap much thought. “But obviously as I’ve got to understand CSE [child sexual exploitation] better, I’ve understood that there is a big difference. I was told a completely different story – I was taught that they were in a relationship and they were not.” How did that feel? “We still don’t know everything that went on,” she says. “What we do know is pretty terrible, so it’s been hard.” She talks in the film about the pain of knowing she was conceived within an abusive relationship: “I have a bad feeling towards myself … and it’s really not nice thinking of yourself like that.” There is a powerful moment in the film when Lowe challenges her grandfather about why he didn’t try to do more to stop Lucy seeing Mehmood. She is torn, she says. “I get really angry about it,” but “I don’t want him to feel any worse than he already does. I didn’t want to seem like the bad person, but at the same time I really needed him to realise what he did wrong. To acknowledge it. I think he has.”     Lowe in a memorial garden for her mother, aunt and grandmother. Photograph: Slater King/BBC/Expectation Media    Does she still feel angry? “No,” she says. In 2000, people didn’t really understand CSE or grooming, she says. And he was far from the only one whose lack of action seems astonishing in hindsight. “It wasn’t right with how Linda was or how the police were, or social services or Lucy’s school or anyone. I think he’s learned and the rest of society have learned and hopefully now we can improve on how we tackle it.” Lucy, she says, was failed in the way that thousands of girls who were victims of child-grooming gangs were with such catastrophic results. “People knew what was happening, but they just didn’t care enough or they just pass the blame on. So it’s upsetting, not just the fact that I’ve lost my mum, and my granddad’s lost his daughters and his wife and the whole life that he used to have, it’s also upsetting because this is just one case out of thousands.” Unsurprisingly, she says: “I had a lot of distrust in systems and authorities because of this.” At secondary school, people started to find out what had happened to Lowe’s family, forcing her to confront other people’s vehement reactions to her personal tragedy. She did have close friends who were supportive, but “pretty much all my friends have a set view on my dad or my mum, so there’s a lot of strong opinions.” These days, she says with a small laugh, when people ask about her family: “I’m just like ‘Google me.’” Growing up, she had some contact with Mehmood’s family. “There was a time in my life where I wanted to understand that side of my family, my culture and my dad’s religion and things.” When she met them, they rarely talked about Mehmood, and never about his crime. “They’d tell me things about the Qur’an and about my grandparents, my aunties and uncles and my cousins, and my distant family members that were in Pakistan.” Astonishingly, when Lowe was 16, she went to visit her father in prison – the first time she had any contact with him. Why did she want to meet him? “Curiosity,” she says. “I wanted to form [my own] opinions, to do with the situation but also separate from that. Because, I could have …” She pauses and says it is not likely to happen at the moment, “but I could have had a relationship with him, if I got to know him as a person. So that’s why I wanted to meet him – to see if we could move past it.” Did she get what she wanted? “Not really. You know when politicians answer questions, they don’t really answer it – it was like that.” I find it difficult to comprehend how she could consider building a relationship, but unless you are the child born into an abusive relationship it must be impossible to understand the complexity. “I’ll always be a bit confused. Because, like, biologically I’m supposed to feel a certain way, so it’s quite difficult … And the fact that I don’t have my mum with me, so I’ve only got him and my granddad, essentially.”     Tasnim as a baby with her mother, Lucy. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian    She says she grew up feeling angry at her father, then adds “but not really angry. I know what my dad did was wrong and terrible. But for a person to do that type of thing – the sex abuse, the murder, all of that – there’s got to be a reason why he’s doing that. But for other people around at the time that could see all these things happening before the arson attack, they really could have done something a lot sooner.” Early last year, Lowe’s family found out that Mehmood would be eligible for parole. “My family would not like him to get parole. But if he does, they don’t want him to be in Telford. And they’ve also requested for him to … it’s kind of like a restraining order. If he contacts me or my granddad or certain family members, then he will go back into prison.” Is that how she feels? “I think it’s best that he doesn’t contact my granddad and family members,” she says, ambiguously. How does she feel about the possibility of him being released? She believes they should review his case and look into whether he should be charged with sex-related crimes. In the documentary, a superintendent from West Mercia police says this is unlikely to happen. Lowe would like her mother’s case to be part of the ongoing inquiry into CSE in Telford. Lucy hasn’t had justice, she says. “I think ultimately to have justice, you need to be accountable for all the crimes committed. But if that does not happen and he gets released, I don’t know.” She pauses. “I’m not going to wish bad on anyone. Do you know what I mean?” Not really, I say. I think that’s incredibly generous. I don’t know how she’s come through relatively – to my eyes – unscathed. “I’ve had loads of counselling,” she says with a smile. She has become a resilient woman with a life – she is a support worker for adults with learning disabilities – friends, a boyfriend, beyond all of this. When Lowe was finally given Lucy’s diaries – which neither she nor her grandfather had known about – she found a letter her mother had written to her as a baby. “I love you so much,” she wrote. It must have been overwhelming to read that. “Yeah,” says Lowe, quietly. “Reading the diaries is like her being here.” Why Dad Killed Mum: My Family’s Secret will be available on BBC Three on iPlayer at 10am on 13 November and BBC1 at 10.45pm the same day"
172,crime,Man arrested over a woman's claims she was conceived by rape,"A man has been arrested over a woman’s claims she was conceived by rape, police have said. The complainant said she discovered her mother was only 13 when she was conceived after obtaining her own adoption files – her own existence was evidence a crime had been committed. She has sought a DNA test to prove the identity of her biological father. On Tuesday, West Midlands police confirmed a man had been arrested on suspicion of rape. “A 73-year old man was re-arrested and interviewed last week following further evidence coming to light He was released on bail. Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) advice will now be sought.” The force had previously said “the law does not recognise her as a victim in these circumstances” and that it had liaised closely with the CPS over the allegation but prosecutors would not support a prosecution. The complainant, who was adopted at seven months old in the 1970s, gained access to her adoption files at 18. Speaking to the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire programme, she said she welcomed the recent arrest and wants the definition of a victim to be reviewed to include people conceived by rape. “I’m still determined to get things changed, so that others don’t go through what I’ve been through,” she added. She has previously described herself as a “walking crime scene” on the same show. “I’d always thought that it was so wrong that my birth father was never prosecuted,” she said last August. “It was then that I thought: ‘I’ve got DNA evidence, because I am DNA evidence. I’m a walking crime scene’.” She added that she wanted her birth father to be held accountable. “I wanted justice for my mum. I wanted justice for me. The ramifications of what he chose to do have shaped my entire life … and he’s been able to get away with it and just live his life.” Speaking at the time, the Labour MP Jess Phillips said the woman should have been considered a victim by the law. “We have long fought … for the idea that children in both domestic and sexual violence circumstances have to be considered not just hapless bystanders in those crimes, but in fact they deeply affect their lives,” she said. The law confers an automatic right to anonymity on complainants in sexual abuse cases and police did not name the arrested man on Tuesday."
173,crime,Hate crimes double in five years in England and Wales,"The number of hate crimes reported to police has more than doubled since 2013, according to government figures, which also showed a large increase last year in offences against people based on sexual orientation. The majority of hate crime offences recorded by police forces in England and Wales were racial – 78,991 – which increased by 11% in the past year.   Related: Anti-Muslim hate crimes soar in UK after Christchurch shootings    Transgender identity hate crimes – the least commonly recorded hate crime in 42 of 44 forces – increased by 37% to 2,333 last year. The Home Office figures also recorded a 25% rise in offences linked to sexual orientation (14,491) while disability hate crimes rose  by 14% to 8,256. The steady rise in recent years is partly because of improvements in crime recording, but there were spikes after events such as the referendum on Britain’s EU membership and terrorist attacks in 2017. Part of the increase over the last year may reflect “a real rise” in hate crimes, the Home Office said.   Hate crimes in England and Wales Hate crimes in England and Wales   Just under half (47%) of religious hate crime offences were targeted against Muslim people (3,530 offences), a similar proportion to last year. However, hate crimes against Jewish people more than doubled, with 18% of religious hate crime offences targeting Jewish people (1,326 offences), compared with 672 in the previous year. Meanwhile a large survey by an umbrella organisation of faith and community groups suggested the Home Office figures potentially showed only the tip of the iceberg, after seven in 10 participants said they never reported hate crimes to the police. Citizens UK, which carried out the survey, released a statement by 18 rabbis, bishops, imams and charity CEOs who expressed “deep concern at the rising tide of fear and division in society and the erosion of trust in public institutions.” They are also calling for inclusion of misogyny as a hate crime. Matthew Bolton, the executive director of Citizens UK, said: “Communities from across the UK are increasingly concerned that we aren’t going fast enough or far enough to strengthen hate crime protections. “Political, media and institutional decision-makers need an action plan to stop the toxic mix of scare stories on social media and a divisive political environment, which is providing a breeding ground for hate.” One elements that emerged from focus groups Citizens UK conducted in a range of cities was how political rhetoric found its way into abusive language on the street. An example was the use of the word “letterboxes” by hate crime perpetrators after Boris Johnson had used it in a Daily Telegraph column to describe women wearing the burqa, according to Dr Farhan Samanani, an academic who oversaw the study. There were 103,379 hate crimes offences recorded by police last year, the majority of which (76%) were race related. More than half, (54%) of the hate crimes recorded by the police were for public order offences, a third (36%) involved violence, while 5% were recorded as criminal damage and arson. Twelve per cent of hate crime offences were estimated to have more than one motivation, with the majority of these being both race and religion. The rise is partly due to improvements in the way crimes are recorded, but there were spikes after events such as the EU referendum and the terrorist attacks in 2017. The increases in hate crime against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people may have been caused by higher confidence in reporting, according to the charity Stonewall, but it also said the figures were likely to represent a tip of an iceberg. Laura Russell, Stonewall’s director of campaigns, policy and research, said: “From our research into hate crime, we know that four in five anti-LGBT hate crimes go unreported, with younger people particularly reluctant to go to the police. “We have long been concerned about the impact debates on LGBT-inclusive education and trans equality in the media, online and in the streets would have on our community. The significant rise in hate crimes against trans people shows the consequences of a society where transphobia is everywhere.” Mark Brookes, campaigns adviser at Dimensions, a nonprofit organisation supporting people with learning disabilities and autism, said he was one of the 73% of people with learning disabilities and autism who have experienced hate crime. “For too long, people like me have lived in fear. I never go out alone after 8pm. I always stay on well-lit streets,” he added. “The reasons for the increase are complex but one thing is clear: a lack of understanding of our experiences by the legal system means victims often don’t feel supported and convictions are rarely achieved.”  A government spokesperson said: “We are encouraged that more people are willing to report hate crime and that police continue to improve their response to victims. “Partners across the criminal justice system, government and in the community are working hard to empower those affected and ensure perpetrators are punished.” Governments measures have included the announcement of a Law Commission review into hate crime legislation as well as funding initiatives including £1.5m to protect places of worship.  CASE STUDIES Alicia* Alicia, a Jewish student in her twenties living in Manchester, was walking down a street this summer when two men approached and said: “We need you to run our business. We need a Jew to run our business because the Jews have all the money.” When she tried to walk away, she was assaulted and sexually harassed by one of the men, who then said: “If you can’t run our business, you can at least fuck me.” She said incidents of sexual harassment were more common when others identified her as being Jewish, with the result that she was being targeted both as a woman and because of her religion. She said she wanted misogyny to be recognised as a hate crime as it would have made her more likely report the incident to the police. Zeinab* Zeinab, a 30-year-old woman of Somali heritage studying in Cardiff, felt let down by police and college authorities when she had experienced hate crime. Her first experience was when a man verbally abused her on a bus, continuing to do so and aggressively threatening her when she moved away from him. No one, including the driver, took any action. After getting off and calling the police, an officer was understanding and helped her to identify the perpetrator, who was charged and fined. She described the process of going to court as “very scary” but decided to proceed because she did not want the behaviour to become a “new normal” in Britain. Months later, she was subjected to similar behaviour by a group of young women at college but neither college staff nor a police officer offered any support. She said they had questioned whether it had been a hate crime and discouraged her from reporting it. *names changed on request of victims"
174,crime,War crimes court approves inquiry into violence against Rohingya,"Judges at the international criminal court (ICC) have authorised a full-scale investigation into allegations of mass persecution and crimes against humanity that forced at least 600,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee Myanmar into neighbouring Bangladesh. 
The ruling, which sets a significant precedent in expanding the jurisdiction of the war crimes court, is the second move against Myanmar this week at international tribunals in The Hague. 
On Monday, a submission was made by the Gambia to the international court of justice (ICJ) accusing Myanmar of genocide through the murder, rape and destruction of communities in the country’s western Rakhine state. 
The ICC decision, announced on Thursday, follows a request by the court’s chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, earlier this year for a formal investigation into alleged ethnic cleansing since 2016. 
Myanmar is not a party to the Rome statute that established the ICC, but its neighbour, Bangladesh, has accepted the court’s jurisdiction. 
By declaring that the ICC exercises jurisdiction over crimes where part of the alleged criminal conduct – in this case mass deportation – takes place on the territory of a state party, the ICC has extended its international law-enforcement role. 
A similar argument has been presented at the ICC on behalf of Syrian refugees who have been forced to flee to neighbouring Jordan, which, like Bangladesh, is a signatory to the Rome statute. 
 
  
  
   
    
    Described as the world’s most persecuted people, 1.1 million&nbsp;Rohingya&nbsp;people live in Myanmar. They live predominately in Rakhine state, where they have co-existed uneasily alongside Buddhists for decades.
    Rohingya people say they are descendants of Muslims, perhaps Persian and Arab traders, who came to&nbsp;Myanmar&nbsp;generations ago. Unlike the Buddhist community, they speak a language similar to the Bengali dialect of Chittagong in Bangladesh.
    The Rohingya are reviled by many in Myanmar as illegal immigrants and suffer from systematic discrimination. The Myanmar government treats them as stateless people, denying them citizenship. Stringent restrictions have been placed on Rohingya people’s freedom of movement, access to medical assistance, education and other basic services.
    Violence broke out in northern Rakhine state in August 2017, when&nbsp;militants attacked government forces. In response, security forces supported by Buddhist militia launched a “clearance operation”&nbsp;that&nbsp; ultimately killed at least 1,000 people and forced more than 600,000 to flee their homes. The UN’s&nbsp;top human rights official&nbsp;said the military’s response was ""clearly disproportionate” to insurgent attacks and warned that Myanmar’s treatment of its Rohingya minority appears to be a ""textbook example” of ethnic cleansing.
    When Aung San Suu Kyi rose to power there were&nbsp;high hopes&nbsp;that the Nobel peace prize winner would help heal Myanmar's entrenched ethnic divides. But she has been accused of standing by while violence is committed against the Rohingya.
    In 2019, judges at the international criminal court authorised a full-scale investigation into the allegations of mass persecution and crimes against humanity. On 10 December 2019, the international court of justice in The Hague opened a case alleging genocide brought by the Gambia.

In its decision on Thursday, the ICC authorised the prosecutor to “proceed with an investigation for the alleged crimes within the ICC’s jurisdiction in the situation in the People’s Republic of Bangladesh/Republic of the Union of Myanmar”. 
Three judges in the ICC’s pre-trial chamber, Judge Olga Herrera Carbuccia, Judge Robert Fremr and Judge Geoffrey Henderson, found “a reasonable basis to believe widespread and/or systematic acts of violence may have been committed that could qualify as the crimes against humanity of deportation across the Myanmar-Bangladesh border and persecution on grounds of ethnicity and/or religion against the Rohingya population”. 
The chamber did not assess whether other associated war crimes may have been committed, but said they could nonetheless form part of the prosecutor’s future investigation. 
Welcoming the ruling, Bensouda said: “This is a significant development, sending a positive signal to the victims of atrocity crimes in Myanmar and elsewhere … We hope that through our work, we can bring justice to the victims, wherever our jurisdictional conditions are met. My investigation will seek to uncover the truth. My office will now focus on ensuring the success of its independent and impartial investigation.” 
The violence in Myanmar, described by the UN as ethnic cleansing and possible genocide, included the killing of thousands of people, the rape of women and children, villages razed and more than 600,000 forced to flee over the border into Bangladesh. Marzuki Darusman, chair of the UN fact-finding mission on Myanmar, said last year there was an “ongoing genocide” in Rakhine. 
Myanmar’s population is overwhelmingly Buddhist, and the Rohingya, who are Muslim, have been stigmatised and targeted in attacks. Buddhist nationalists, led by firebrand monks, have organised an Islamophobic campaign calling for them to be expelled. Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s de facto ruler, has been condemned for her refusal to intervene and protect the Rohingya. 
In a statement, the ICC said: “Victims unanimously insist that they want an investigation by the court and many of [those] consulted … believe that only justice and accountability can ensure that the perceived circle of violence and abuse comes to an end.” 
Between 600,000 and one million Rohingya were forcibly displaced from Myanmar to neighbouring Bangladesh from 2016 as a result of ethnic cleansing, according to numerous human rights reports. 
The ICC’s judicial authorisation gives the green light for prosecutors to start collecting evidence that could form the basis for summonses to appear or arrest warrants for Myanmar’s military and political leaders."
175,crime,British mother accused of murdering two-year-old son dies in hospital,"A British woman suspected of murdering her two-year-old son has died in hospital after she was arrested and detained in Finland. The 35-year-old was held in January after a child died in a two-bed apartment in the Suurpelto area of Espoo, Finland’s second biggest city. The mother, named as Ayesha Ali by the Sunday Mirror, was being held in Vantaa prison near Helsinki. She was taken to hospital on Tuesday last week. Crime commissioner Petri Eronen said in a statement: “The cause of death is being investigated under a strict duty of confidentiality. Therefore, we cannot reveal more details. On a general level, we can say that the police are investigating what led to the suspect’s death.”  In a previous statement, police said the mother had confessed to the killing and a trial date had been set for 17 April atLänsi-Uusimaa district court. Ali, from Newcastle-under-Lyme in Staffordshire, taught English as a second language at a training company in Helsinki, according to her LinkedIn profile. Prior to this role, she worked as an English teacher for international students at Keele University in the UK. In 2011, she married her husband, a Canadian and Algerian citizen, in Canada, court documents show. They lived in the UK, Finland and China together before returning to Finland in January 2019. However, the couple applied for a divorce last year, which came into effect earlier this month, and had disagreed over custody arrangements, the documents said.

176,crime,Just 22 mosques given funding for hate crime security last year,"Widespread distrust of the Home Office’s counter-extremism strategy by British Muslims has been cited as one of the obstacles to mosques using a government scheme to protect places of worship from hate crime, after figures showed just 22 received funding last year. The £375,413 awarded to the mosques under the scheme is a tiny fraction of the £14m provided by a separate government fund for assisting the Jewish community. Applications by 24 mosques failed. While Muslim representatives do not criticise government funding to Jewish counterparts, they are pressing for changes to a wider scheme funding security for mosques, churches and temples at a time when most religious hate crime – 52% of all incidents last year – is aimed at Muslims. Obstacles to mosques taking advantage of the Home Office’s places of worship protective security scheme – which was given a boost in funding after the Christchurch attacks and reopens in July – include bureaucracy surrounding the application process and the inability of mosques in some of the country’s poorest areas to pay costs upfront before being reimbursed. The scheme had been closed at times when mosques needed to access it, including during Ramadan and after Christchurch, according to the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), which laid out concerns in a document sent to the Home Office after carrying out consultations in April and May. Without serious changes, the MCB briefing says, the scheme “will fail to deliver the desired outcomes of good uptake, trust and respect among Muslim and likely other faith communities in Britain today”. Distrust of the government’s Prevent strategy has led some Muslim communities to ignore the fund, and instead fundraise to pay for their own security arrangements and training, according to the MCB. While describing the provision of £5m over three years to support security training as “well intentioned”, the document contrasted this with the much smaller pot (£1.6m) for available for ‘physical security’ pointing out that most small to medium sized places of worship lack basic CCTV and alarms “which are most urgently needed first before training.” Alarm was also expressed about the omission from the scheme of Northern Ireland and Scotland in light of Islamophobic attacks in both countries. The largest number of applications for funding last year came from mosques in the north-west and West Midlands, with 10 and 8 respectively, figures obtained by the Guardian under the Freedom of Information Act show. Seven came from London, where one successful applicant received £9,283. Churches also continue to access the scheme, with nine receiving a total of £126,832.32 last year. A member of the inter-faith advisory panel, which overseas applications for funding under the scheme, said the uptake by mosques had been improving but that there was an ongoing debate with other members about how it should be changed. Fiyaz Mughal said: “There basically needs to be much more money provided to cover the scale of the threat. My own personal opinion is that the government cannot keep pushing the line that all of the communities are in it together. The government are playing politics on this and I don’t think that’s acceptable. They need to act on the basis of which community is most at risk.” Mosques received 46% of the total funding available last year, followed by Sikh Gurdwaras (37%), churches (16%) and Hindu temples (1.06%). A Home Office spokesman said: “We are proud of our Muslim communities and are absolutely committed to ensuring they, like everyone else, are able to practise their faith in safety and free from fear. “Earlier this year the home secretary announced he had doubled funding for next year’s places of worship protective security to £1.6m. We have also streamlined the application process to make it easier to apply.” It said more than a third of grants in previous rounds of the scheme had been awarded to mosques. ‘We have to take it seriously when someone says: “You’re next”’ Shattering a glass entrance door, the brick was thrown just minutes after a group of children had left the building last week, the third such attack on the Masjid Ibrahim mosque in east London in as many months. According to Asim Uddin, the chair of the mosque management committee, he and fellow worshipers in Plaistow have become resigned to having to largely fend for themselves when it comes to funding the security of their 18-year-old place of worship against the threats that have accompanied growing intolerance. “We have learned that it’s better to be self sufficient and use the resources that we have,” said Uddin. He said the mosque had a very good relationship with the police but criticised the Home Office’s places of worship protective security scheme, saying: “When we needed to get access it was not open.” “We’ve applied in the past but it’s quite complex. Then we were told that only 75% of the funding will be given,” he said, referring to how the mosque considered sourcing CCTV equipment. “It would have been £10,000 worth of equipment. We had to generate our own resources and then we were restricted to particular suppliers.” Volunteers helped secure the mosque over Ramadan, but Uddin said the Home Office scheme could be better used to provide wages for security guards. Those concerns were echoed by Mohammed Kozbar, the chairman of Finsbury Park mosque in north London, where one man was killed and nine others were injured when a van was ploughed into them by the terrorist Darren Osborne, who was jailed for life over the attack. A short-term increase in security was also put in place over Ramadan at the mosque, which tends to be on the receiving end of threats that typically multiply after events such as Christchurch. “We cannot afford to ignore them. You have to take it seriously when someone calls and says ‘you’re next’,” said Kozbar. Calls are now logged and suspicious mail is opened with gloves, after previous incidents in which white powder was sent in envelopes. Despite this, the mosque remains outward looking, welcoming homeless people for meals on a regular basis, for example. Outside hangs a large banner bearing a line from the Qur’an – “and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other” – with a smaller poster on a wall beneath advertising free self-defence training for women. “As a small charity we have limited funds. At Ramadan, we had to find the resources we needed to hire extra security, especially for nights, but couldn’t keep it going,” said Kozbar. “The Home Office funding is not straightfroward to apply for. There is help for doors, locks, but many mosques have that in place. What we really need is help to pay for security personnel. Our people are volunteers and are not security professionals at the end of the day.”"
177,crime,"Knife crime is a real problem, but stop and search isn't the solution","To be clear from the outset, stop and search does not effectively reduce serious youth violence. It simply enables the police to aggressively control public space and discriminate against ethnic minorities, and in doing so it damages the relationships between the communities affected and the police. The recent announcement of the home secretary, Priti Patel, extending stop and search powers under section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, is the latest in a line of policy announcements from this government that are designed to attract short-term political support rather than to keep our streets safe and our police forces accountable. These proposals also conveniently remove the safeguards introduced by Theresa May as home secretary in 2014 under the best use of stop and search scheme. At a time when we should be working together for solutions we instead have politicking and legacy denigration. The lack of meaningful engagement with impacted communities, grassroots community groups and civil society organisations about the changes is telling. The Metropolitan police recently apologised after its commissioner, Cressida Dick, wrongly stated at a home affairs committee last month that the force had been regularly consulting with the campaign group StopWatch. For transparency, StopWatch has yet to meet Dick since she began her tenure in April 2017. Neither has any representative from the Metropolitan police met StopWatch for the past three years. It is good to know that we are significant enough that people are telling mistruths about having met us though. StopWatch has now requested a meeting and is awaiting a response. The section 60 pilot launched by the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, has not even finished let alone undergone an independent review. And yet Boris Johnson’s government has decided to roll it out across England and Wales based on “feedback”. Whether this is incompetence, stupidity or woeful ignorance, we should be challenging elected officials and policymakers to implement measures that are fair and effective, not reactionary and regressive.    Disproportionate use of stop and search perpetuates racial discrimination and class discrimination    If an evidence-based approach to the use of stop and search were to be adopted it would be obvious that it is not as beneficial as the government claims. One only need look to the research published by the College of Policing in 2017 which stated that there was only limited evidence that stop and search tactics had a meaningful deterrent effect on crime. If research isn’t your thing then listen to the words of a chief constable who told the Guardian that “there are so many areas where we could improve the life chances of people, rather than arresting them and putting them into a conveyor belt of the criminal justice system, which often leads to them becoming harder and harsher criminals”. At Stopwatch we know all too well the impact of disproportionate stop and search. Since 2010 our organisation has worked to highlight the perils of allowing excessive and disproportionate police powers to be used on individuals – particularly those with black and brown skin. Disproportionate use of stop and search perpetuates racial discrimination and class discrimination. In our report The Colour Of Injustice, published in October 2018, we found that the rates of stop and search carried out by police were affected more by levels of deprivation and inequality than crime. This in turn fuelled disproportionality, as people from black and other minority ethnic groups tend to live in deprived areas and were frequently subjected to stop and search. By contrast, white people living in relatively affluent and wealthy areas were subjected to very low rates of stop and search. The difference in treatment is not justifiable. With the pandemonium of a knife crime epidemic upon us, government strategists lace TV, print and online news with stories meant to convince us that stop and search really is the best that we can do. The voices of campaigners who have pored over masses of data and listened to hundreds of firsthand accounts of the egregious impact of this practice are pressed into a half-minute segment which is supposed to balance out the polished and unsupported statements of our prime minister and home secretary. The soundbite nature of TV news has made it easy for government to erode our civil liberties. It forces a debate about the efficacy of stop and search upon us when there is no real debate to be had: all the evidence tells us this is a terrible idea.     ‘When officers conduct a search with reasonable grounds they are more likely to uncover a weapon.’ Metropolitan police officers carrying out a stop and search. Photograph: John Stillwell/PA    The figures are the figures and according to Home Office statistics between April 2017 and March 2018, a mere 2% of stop and searches carried out under section 60 actually lead to an arrest for an offensive weapon. This is pitiful, especially when compared with the 14% of stop and searches carried out under section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 that lead to an arrest for an offensive weapon. What this means is that when officers conduct a search with reasonable grounds they are more likely to uncover a weapon. Yet ministers push for the least effective use of the power to be used more.   Related: Johnson's crackdown on offenders will only entrench crime    If the government’s stated aim is to take knives off our street, then why not consider other methods? In March it was reported that knife amnesty bins had been credited with removing 50,000 knives from the streets of London. However, the number of knife amnesty bins has been reduced from 36 in 2012 to 18 in 2019. The reduction has been attributed to a loss in public funding – funding that is unlikely to be replenished under this government’s proposals. Ultimately, the government’s reliance on section 60 stop and searches is no solution to the social problems underlying serious youth violence in the UK. It is high time police forces explored more innovative ways of keeping our communities healthy rather than relying on the same old dogmas for political gain. • Katrina Ffrench is chief executive of StopWatch  "
178,crime,"Reynhard Sinaga's life sentence for rapes 'fits his crimes', says father","The father of the man described as the most prolific rapist in British legal history has said his son’s punishment of life in jail “fits his crimes”. The first comments from Reynhard Sinaga’s immediate family came as more of his potential victims approached police following his sentencing on Monday to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 30 years. The 36-year-old’s father, Saibun Sinaga, told the BBC in a phone call: “We accept the verdict. His punishment fits his crimes. I don’t want to discuss the case any further.” Greater Manchester police opened a dedicated major incident hotline following the sentencing of Sinaga, a PhD student from Indonesia.  He has been convicted of 136 rapes and sexual offences against 48 young men over two-and-a-half years but police believe he may have assaulted at least 195 men over a longer period. Sinaga lured his victims back to his flat in Manchester city centre under the guise of being a good Samaritan before drugging them and attacking them after they had passed out. Detectives said on Tuesday that there had been multiple calls to its major incident hotline since the sentencing and that some of these were from potential further victims of the student. Although police declined to disclose specific numbers, the force said its incident room had received a “very positive response”.   Related: Reynhard Sinaga: the 'Peter Pan' student who raped scores of men    Duncan Craig, the chief executive of the charity Survivors Manchester, which is supporting some of Sinaga’s victims, said he understood that “about 30 calls” had been made to the hotline although it was unclear how many of those were from potential further victims. He said: “In my office there’s people ringing up who aren’t directly affected by this particular case but are people who have been sexually assaulted, maybe even in childhood, feeling that now is the time to talk.” Craig, a trained therapist, said the men abused by Sinaga would be feeling a combination of relief and shock now their abuser had been unmasked, following four trials which imposed reporting restrictions preventing the cases from being made public. He told the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire programme: “Everything becomes much more of a reality now. “Particularly survivors will talk about when a case has concluded there’s this momentary euphoria of ‘Oh thank goodness, that’s it, it’s over’ and then the sudden realisation of ‘Now the work starts to build my life back up’.” Sinaga, who arrived in Britain on a student visa in 2007, was convicted of 159 offences against 48 young men between January 2015 and June 2017, when he was arrested after one of his victims regained consciousness during an assault. Police believe he attacked at least 195 victims, including the 48 whose cases were brought to court, judging by the number of “trophies” the rapist kept following his assaults, including video footage, wallets, watches, mobile phones and ID cards. All but four of the 48 victims he assaulted were raped. Sinaga was jailed for a minimum of 30 years on Monday. The judge, Suzanne Goddard QC, described him as a “dangerous, deeply disturbed and perverted individual” who would never be safe to be released. Greater Manchester police said anyone with information relating to Sinaga could contact 0800 092 0410 (calls made from within the UK) or 020 7158 0124 (international calls) or make a report online. Anyone affected by the case and needing support from specialist agencies can contact 0800 056 0154 (calls made from within the UK) or 020 7158 0011 (international calls)."
179,crime,Syrian refugees ask Norway police to investigate war crimes,"Syrian refugees in Norway have joined a pan-European drive for justice over torture, extra-judicial killings and other abuse, making a landmark request for Norwegian police to investigate atrocities committed during Syria’s long civil war. Five torture survivors filed statements on what they endured and witnessed in more than a dozen prisons, and provided a dossier of evidence linking the mistreatment to 17 named, high-ranking officials in the Syrian government. Abuse included extrajudicial killings, rape, beatings and floggings, often on the soles of their feet, hanging victims by their wrists for long periods, pulling out fingernails and using electric shocks. “I am still suffering from the effects of the torture,” said one of the group, who asked to be known only as Mira to protect family still in Syria. “For the last eight years, I can’t get even two hours of sleep. Even with all the sedatives and painkillers, I still just relive what happened in the prisons, hour by hour.” The move comes weeks after German prosecutors made a historic decision to charge two alleged former Syrian secret services officers with crimes against humanity, setting the stage for the first trial over state-sponsored torture in Syria to be held anywhere in the world. The two suspects had come to Germany as refugees, and were arrested earlier this year after campaigners handed over a dossier of evidence similar to that submitted in Norway. Horrific testimony and detailed documentation of atrocities has been filtering across Syria’s borders since soon after the war began in 2011, but the international community has struggled to respond with any concerted push for accountability. Syria is not a party to the treaty that established the international criminal court (ICC), and Russia and China have vetoed efforts to mandate the ICC to set up a special tribunal for Syria. In the vacuum, activists and human rights lawyers have been working on a patchwork of efforts to seek justice and dispel a sense of impunity, using national laws, particularly in countries where Syrian refugees have settled or where high-ranking officials have connections. In Norway, they are relying on a provision in the penal code – universal jurisdiction – that allows authorities to investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity even if they were committed outside the country by people who are not Norwegian. Previous Norwegian war crimes investigations have focused on perpetrators who had settled in Norway after carrying out atrocities elsewhere. “We are asking Norwegian authorities to do something they have not done before. But we are convinced we are not asking them to do something impossible,” said Gunnar Ekeløve-Slydal from the Norwegian Helsinki committee, which is supporting the case. Universal jurisdiction also applies in Germany, Sweden and Austria, and campaigners have used it to file cases in all three countries. Germany, where these efforts began, has already proved that this approach offers a new path towards some accountability. “When we first started, people said: ‘You are crazy, no one will hand out arrest warrants,’” said Patrick Kroker, from the Berlin-based European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights, which is helping coordinate the criminal complaints. Now two men face trial over abuse, and Germany has an international arrest warrant out for Jamil Hassan, the head of the Syrian Air Force Intelligence Directorate. The cases have been vital in sending a message to Syrian officials that “they are not all-powerful, it is not a wall of impunity”, Kroker added. Lawyers also hope the German prosecutors’ decision to take the cases forward will encourage progress in other countries. “I am optimistic about proceedings across Europe, even if some countries are slower. What happens in one country pushes the others,” said Anwar al-Bunni, a Syrian human rights lawyer who was himself jailed more than once before escaping the country, and has played a key role in bringing the cases. The Norwegian case is not only about seeking justice for historic crimes, witnesses say. Nearly nine years into Syria’s civil war, Bashar al-Assad has consolidated his hold on power on the ground, with the help of Russian and Iranian backers. The country’s jails are still full of prisoners at risk of abuse. “There are hundreds of thousands of detainees still in the government’s centres and I feel for them, because I was once a detainee,” said one man who gave testimony in Norway. “We’ve started this just to make those [officials] over there feel there are consequences for their actions.” Because Norwegian law does not allow trial in absentia, the best result that the Syrians and their lawyers can hope for is that police, after investigating, issue arrest warrants for the people named. But even that will be a significant victory, they say. “Catching is not my target now. My first aim is to send a message of hope to victims – ‘someone cares about you getting justice,” said Bunni. “Then I want the criminals who committed these crimes, who feel comfortable and think they have impunity, to know their position will not protect them.”"
180,crime,True crime grips London book fair 2019,"The spectre of true crime was stalking the aisles at this year’s London book fair, with publishers snapping up investigations into past evils in the wake of successes in podcasting and television such as Dirty John, Serial and The Teacher’s Pet. Offers were flying in for former Waterstones bookseller Susan Jonusas’s first book Hell’s Half-Acre, a study of the the Bender family of serial killers in Kansas in 1873. Jonusas, 24, left Waterstones in December to write full-time. “Buried on a homestead seven miles south of the town were 11 bodies in varying states of decay. Further investigation revealed a well containing remains of even more victims. The number of people murdered was estimated at 20,” said Jonusas’s literary agency. “The idea that a family of seemingly respectable homesteaders were capable of operating ‘a human slaughter pen’ appalled and fascinated the nation. But who the Benders really were, why they committed such a vicious killing spree and what became of them when they fled from the law is a mystery that has remained unsolved to this day.” UK rights are still being finalised, with Viking snapping it up for a six-figure deal in the US. Agent Georgina Capel, who was fielding offers for the book, said: “I suspect the true-crime podcast thing is driving the current interest.” Foreign publishers were also eyeing mortuary technician Carla Valentine’s Murder Isn’t Easy, which sold to Little, Brown UK earlier this spring. This sees Valentine applying her knowledge of modern forensic science to the murders in Agatha Christie’s mysteries. “The basic tenet of forensic science is that ‘every contact leaves a trace’, and Carla begins her study into Christie’s novels as any investigator would – by surveying ‘the scene of the crime’ (a phrase coined by Christie herself),” said literary agent Martin Redfern at Northbank Talent Management. “She examines the use of fingerprints, firearms, handwriting, impressions, blood-spatter analysis and toxicology in the novels, before finally revealing the role the dead body itself played in offering vital clues to dastardly crimes.” Redfern said there was considerable interest in true crime from publishers, “both historical and present day, focusing not just on criminals but all those involved in the criminal justice system, from barristers to psychologists to prison officers”. And a 13-publisher auction for forensic psychiatrist and psychotherapist Dr Gwen Adshead’s investigation into the nature of evil, The Devil You Know, was won by Faber. Co-written with Eileen Horne, the book is a series of case studies of the patients Adshead worked with over 20 years at Broadmoor hospital. Faber’s Laura Hassan said the book “has the power to explode our assumptions and ultimately to change our minds, whether about the nature of evil, society’s attitude towards punishment or the possibility of rehabilitation”. Jonny Geller of agency Curtis Brown said the mood at the fair was positive and while no one was talking about Brexit, it was the elephant in the room. “With Brexit, Trump and what is happening in Brazil, there is so much turbulence in markets that politics does impact what people will be reading,” he said. “What I saw from the Americans was that they were finding literary fiction difficult. They have become introverted in their reading, turning to buying stacks of self-help, psychology, diet books. In that environment, fiction can sometimes suffer. I wonder if Brexit will make people want to read more out of themselves, and lead to a surge in fiction.” The holy grail of the fair was narrative non-fiction, including true crime, Geller said: “People want real, authentic experience, and written well. Look at Adam Kay’s This Is Going to Hurt, which has spent 42 weeks in the bestseller charts … the interest in true crime is the natural progression for readers tired of thrillers, who still want suspense and that expert voice.” There was also room at the fair for news of more established names: a new novel from Salman Rushdie, Quichotte, inspired by Don Quixote and following the adventures of an ageing travelling salesman who falls in love with a TV star and travels across the US to prove himself worthy of her hand; a sequel to PS I Love You from bestselling Irish novelist Cecelia Ahern, which revisits the world of Holly seven years after her husband’s death; and “a no holds barred” memoir by Elton John, written with Guardian critic Alexis Petridis."
181,crime,'My favorite murder': killer queens of the true-crime podcast,"Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark are not your average agony aunts. For a start there’s the fact that they dispense funny advice and useful self-care tips alongside descriptions of the details of notorious murders. If that mixture of true crime and practical advice sounds surprising then you’ve clearly never listened to Kilgariff and Hardstark’s hit podcast, My Favorite Murder, in which the two women start off each week by discussing an infamous crime before inevitably getting side-tracked into talking about past experiences and current obsessions. Hugely popular – it pulls in more than 19 million listeners a week and has seen the women sell out venues not only across their native US but also in Australia, Ireland and the UK, where another tour is planned for later this year – My Favorite Murder stands out in an endless sea of true-crime podcasts, largely because of the easy camaraderie between its two hosts, Kilgariff, 49, a writer and former stand-up comedian, and Hardstark, 38, a host on the Cooking Channel and contributor to the popular comedy show Drunk History. Listening to them shoot the breeze about whatever has caught their fancy that week, from where to go on holiday to what to do if you suddenly find yourself caught up in a cult, is like hanging out at a crowded party with the coolest people in the room, the kind of women who will make you scream with laughter largely by saying something so dark and yet so funny that you can’t quite help yourself. “I think the appeal is that we are in no way pretending to be or thinking that we are perfect,” says Kilgariff on the phone from Los Angeles. “What we’re saying is that the best thing to do is have a good, happy fulfilling life and if you fuck up then you fuck up and that’s OK.”     The write stuff: onstage at a literary festival in Beverly Hills, California. Photograph: Charley Gallay/Getty Images for Pen America    Hardstark agrees: “We’re living in a period where women are sick of competing against each other and what people like about the podcast is that it’s all about building people up, not tearing each other down.” My Favorite Murder was born out of a late-night conversation at a Halloween party when both women realised that they shared a similar obsession with lurid true-crime stories. It has proved so successful that they have performed in front of thousands of rapt fans, launched a membership scheme called Fan Cult with an annual cost of $39.99 (£31.50) and now have a website selling a range of merch. This week sees the UK publication of their spin-off memoir, Stay Sexy &amp; Don’t Get Murdered. “Yeah, we really never expected it to get this big,” Kilgariff says. “It’s out of control,” agrees Hardstark. Yet it’s easy to see just why they have such a huge following. Stay Sexy, an empathetic, insightful and crucially very funny look over the key moments of both women’s lives, covers everything from how to deal with a much-loved parent’s slow slide into dementia to what to do when the life you have turns out not to be the one you imagined, and does so with wit and a weary but hopeful compassion at the state of the world. “When I was a kid we’d go and visit my grandmother, and my dad is one of eight so they’d all be sitting there updating everyone on the good things but also on the fact that so and so had cancer or had lost their job, and people would make jokes,” says Kilgariff. “I think sometimes it’s only by talking about what’s really going on that you can make it less scary. We all feel anxious at times and acknowledging that only helps.” As in the podcast, those serious moments nestle up against more light-hearted diversions. Kilgariff explains what life was like as a latchkey kid in the 70s (one step up from trying to survive The Hunger Games). Hardstark delves into what to do if your brother suddenly disappears on a camping holiday (don’t start imagining that he’s been brutally murdered, however much you want to). Both women offer very funny advice on how to party and what to do when your body is telling you the party’s over.     ‘The listeners are so clever and funny and weird and cool’: Kilgariff and Hardstark. Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images    “In a lot of ways it’s as much a cry for help as a self-help book,” says Kilgariff, laughing. “For a long time we were languishing in the fantasy that we were going to write a coffee-table book with big writing, funny jokes and minimal effort, but then our editor told us we had to write something more personal and by then we were in too deep to get out.” From the start they decided that no punches would be pulled either in language or tone, with both hosts prepared to speak honestly about their own issues. Hardstark, who has ADHD and anxiety, had a difficult childhood involving spells in rehab; Kilgariff has had issues with alcohol, drugs and diet pills. Both women are “college drop-outs” who understand what it feels like to struggle to pay the rent. “We don’t really have the ability to bullshit, so from the start all we could do was talk honestly about our own experiences,” Kilgariff says. “Everyone’s done shit in the past that they’ve regretted, or had moments they wish they’d approached differently. For us, saying that out loud wasn’t a big deal.” “One of the hardest things in the world is when you can’t connect, or think that no one is listening to you,” Hardstark adds. “I think what works is that we’re not ashamed of saying when things have gone wrong.” The podcast’s most devoted fans, who describe themselves as “Murderinos”, have credited Kilgariff and Hardstark with helping them deal with their own issues. The duo are very careful to focus on mental health awareness and try their best to ensure that amid the bleak recounting of brutal crimes there is always hope. “When we started we thought that people would want to talk about the murders, but actually it’s the other stuff they want to talk about,” Hardstark says. “They come up to us and say: ‘I had this stuff happen in my life, too,’ or: ‘You made me more aware of this.’ We have people talk to us about how the podcast has helped them feel better.” Some of the responses, she says, have blown them away. “It can range from the really heavy to the amazing. We have people who come up and say that listening to the podcast has given them the push they needed to change their studies, and people who say that it’s led to them talking to their mother again – and both those things are equally monumental. It’s incredible that making some jokes and talking about our lives can inspire people in that way.” Not that the “cult” (as Hardstark and Kilgariff jokingly describe it) is all about self-care and good advice. Murderinos fully embrace both the macabre and the sharp sense of humour, turning up to the arena events with dresses adorned with murder weapons and wearing T-shirts saying: “Toxic Masculinity Ruins the Party Once Again,” a phrase which can also be found emblazoned on greeting cards. “We get some great gifts,” says Kilgariff. “Trophies, very funny things, one woman even made a diorama of us sitting recording the podcast.” “That was wild,” says Hardstark. “So much of the stuff we get makes us laugh out loud. The listeners are so clever and funny and weird and cool.” Kilgariff starts laughing. “The best was one lady who told us we could quit any time… She meant it in a lovely way. She just grabbed both of us and said: ‘You don’t have to do this, you can stop at any time.’” Given that it’s been two years from podcast to bestselling book, the whole thing must feel like being on a rollercoaster. Hardstark laughs: “We know it can’t last, so it’s all about having as much fun as we can while it does. It’s been a life-changing experience, but we know how fortunate we are so we’re just enjoying the ride and getting high off it.” “I think we should just keep doing it until we burn out completely,” Kilgariff says with perfect deadpan delivery. “Although, really, we have no choice but to do a musical. We don’t want to and it’s not a good idea, but we’re almost certainly going to have to. It is what it is.” Stay Sexy &amp; Don’t Get Murdered by Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark (Orion Books, £14.99) is available from guardianbookshop.com for £13.19"
182,crime,‘Woefully low’: Cressida Dick calls for action on crime-solving rates,"The Metropolitan police commissioner has hit out at “woefully low” rates for solving crimes, with courts “emptying” despite some offences rising. Cressida Dick used a keynote lecture to call for better use of data and public consent to avoid charges of a “police state”. Talking to an audience in London at the thinktank the Police Foundation, Dick said she was not proud of low detection rates for some crimes. Official figures for England and Wales show rape down to a 4% detection rate, and an overall detection rate for all recorded offences of 9%. Dick compared those low figures to the Met’s 90% detection rate for homicides in London and said: “Overall, police detection rates nationally are low, woefully low I would say in some instances, and the courts are emptying, not filling. So what magic wand would it take for us to be able to apply what we can do in murder to so many other cases?”   Related: Facial recognition tech is arsenic in the water of democracy, says Liberty    The Met commissioner said growing availability of data from phones and CCTV cameras may hold the answer. She said: “A very, very large proportion of crimes that currently occur could be prevented or at least successfully investigated in the reasonably near future by the use of data that is already theoretically available and technology that is already developed.” She said cases were becoming increasingly complex and in the future police would need more resources in terms of people and investment in technology, and more skills to handle and analyse data. Dick was setting out one of the battlegrounds in modern society: growing technology offering law enforcement greater opportunities to boost crime-fighting and detection, set against privacy groups and civil libertarians calling for limits and tough rules to stop a Big Brother state developing. The Met is one of several forces trialling facial-recognition technology, which is proving controversial. Earlier this week figures revealed that across England and Wales the number of detectives in homicide and major crime units had fallen by 28% since 2010, when the Conservative government began cutting funding to the police. Homicide clear-up rates across England and Wales also fell in the same period."
183,crime,"Extraction review – hokey, high-octane action thriller","Sadly, this has nothing to do with dentistry. Extraction is a made-for-Netflix action thriller from veterans of the Marvel Comic Universe – screenwriter Joe Russo, stunt-specialist-turned-director Sam Hargrave and star Chris Hemsworth. It’s based on the graphic novel Cuidad (which Russo co-authored), transferring the action from the Paraguayan city of Ciudad Del Este to Dhaka in Bangladesh. Extraction is a little bit hokey and absurd, and the very end has an exasperating cop-out – but it has to be admitted that, in terms of pure action octane, Russo and Hargrave bring the noise, and there are quite a few long-distance “sniper” scenes in which people get taken out from miles away as the bullet travels through their skulls with a resonant thoonk.              Hemsworth is the improbably named Tyler Rake, a super-tough mercenary soldier and legendary warrior, secretly sad and lonely. When the school-age son of Mumbai crime lord Ovi Mahajan (Pankaj Tripathi) is kidnapped by rival Bangladeshi mobster Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli), Tyler is hired for a staggering sum of money to go in to Dhaka – all guns blazing and combat knives stabbing – to get the kid back. Extract him, in fact. But when he does, Tyler realises that he is being double-crossed all over the shop and he finds that the only human being he quite likes is Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the terrified boy now under his protection. So the odd quasi-father-son couple go on the run in the teeming, chaotic streets, and there is some impressive stunt work and fantastically steroidal action sequences. Golshifteh Farahani plays Tyler’s handler Nik, whose job it is to make earpiece contact with him, in the now accepted Mission: Impossible style, although there isn’t much here for her to do. A few earsplitting bangs for your buck, anyway.  • Extraction is available on Netflix from 24 April."
184,crime,Spencer Matthews and Olly Murs – the perfect reality crime fighters,"An exciting career evolution for former Made in Chelsea star Spencer Matthews, who this week starred in a reality-based crime event in a London luxury watch shop. In this era of unscripted reality shows, the challenge for any star is to adapt their persona into new formats, constantly evolving beyond the premise of the last show in which they learned patisserie or telemarque skiing or drawled “stop getting up in my grill” to someone who would go on to design a shortlived line of yoga-attire. And so with Spencer, who began his career on Made in Chelsea, a show that seemed primarily to consist of people affectlessly discussing heavily staged betrayal-effect events over drinks in Fulham. Thereafter, he progressed through The Bachelor, where he featured as the eponymous bachelor, I’m a Celebrity, where he left camp due to steroid cravings, then on to The Jump, which he won, and Celebrity Masterchef, where he cooked some lovely mullet or something. Earlier this year, he and his wife and baby starred in the dedicated reality show Spencer, Vogue and Baby Too. If you were wondering “where next?” – and it seems unfathomable that you wouldn’t have been – the answer is perhaps to be found in a video upload to Spencer’s Instagram, where he detailed his involvement in a dramatic heist. We lay our scene in high-end Mayfair watch shop The Hour House – and I want to say right off the bat that this column’s tireless commitment to service journalism isn’t going to extend to finding out a whole lot about the type of products on sale there. There’s really only one word for the sort of person who knows the difference between a luxury watch and a chronometer – or even worse, between a chronograph and a chronometer. Unfortunately, we just don’t use this word in the Guardian unless it’s in reported speech. And at the time of writing, I was unable to lay my hands on a public figure to say it loud about “watch people”, so do please fill in the blank yourself. For now, back to the luxury timepiece emporium, where Tuesday afternoon saw Spencer in store to pick up what he describes as a “vintage piece”. All of a sudden, a commotion ensues. We will cross to Spencer’s account, mindful that he is using a tense sometimes known as the football continuous. Though it appears to suggest that events happening then are still happening now and will somehow continue to happen, it is thought that they in fact have been brought to a conclusion. Anyway: “These guys drive a scooter through the glass and start battering the shop with hammers, big huge hammers, wearing helmets. We’re in the back of the shop looking at them, sprint downstairs, hide in the vault until all the noise passes. Come upstairs and the place is just battered. All the watches gone.” A very thorough job. But what of Spencer’s “vintage piece”? “We were looking around and I’m just thinking fucking hell, the thing that I’ve been waiting for has obviously just been nicked, so I’m going to have to go and get another one.” Totally. If you don’t immediately shop your way out of the problem then the terrorists have already won. But stay! For there is a horological twist. “Lo and behold we look around and on the floor amongst all the rubble and the glass and stuff there’s one watch in the entire shop and it’s mine. Now if that’s not luck, I don’t know what is.” Luck indeed. The only other possibility is that the luxury watch/chronometer/chronograph/armclock was judged too unpleasant to steal – but perhaps we shall learn more in any upcoming trial. Police say they have arrested three men in connection with the incident. Either way, this is quite the most alarming incident involving a reality star within striking distance of London’s Oxford Street since 2017, when Olly Murs ordered an evacuation of Selfridges department store on the basis of what would turn out to be faulty intelligence. In fact, could that not be the next format to be graced with Spencer’s presence? Murs &amp; Matthews team up to tackle the capital’s violent crime problems? True Crime With Matthews &amp; Murs? Surely ITV2 should be considering something along these lines, and we must await the announcement at its very earliest convenience. Ed Sheeran’s song without praise To the world of musical collaboration, next, where it turns out that Ed Sheeran has suggestions easily as problematic as the various home improvements that have fallen foul of planners at his Suffolk home. Back in April, you may recall, we looked at how Ed’s local council has turned down his applications to build a 24-seat chapel, then required him to take down a sauna hut and a five-metre-long sign for the private pub in his garden. It also seems doubtful that the “wildlife pond” it granted him permission for is really a wildlife pond at all, on the basis that it is kidney-shaped, lined with pale blue mosaic tiles, and has handrails and steps leading down into it. But are any of these schemes really as troubling as the musical one Ed has just revealed: to wit, a Lady Marmalade-style single featuring himself, Bruno Mars and Justin Bieber? “I had an idea of doing that,” he explains of the genus of his forthcoming musical collaborations album. “Like you could get Bruno, Bieber and me on a record, how fun would that be?” Not enormously, perhaps – a fact it seems was instinctively grasped by Bruno when Ed suggested it to him. “The first person I rung was Bruno,” Ed recalls, “and he was just like, ‘let’s just do a song together, just us’.” Hard lines on Bieber, of course – but the luckiest of escapes for so many others, and a reminder that you can’t simply stick up an earsore at will, and expect not to meet trenchant objections. Bradley puts a spoke in a culture Q&amp;A  Cultural interview of the week, finally, comes courtesy of a Times chat with former champion cyclist Bradley Wiggins. Given that this particular Q&amp;A slot is called My Culture Fix, either Bradley or his people, or both, should arguably have known what he was getting into. Then again, perhaps they did, and thought it worth the exposure. Either way, the tone is set from the first of the standard questions, in which Bradley is asked for his favourite author or book. “I’m not really a reader,” comes the reply. “I haven’t got the attention span. Skip the books.” Got it. On to the next question, then, which asks for his favourite play or playwright. Here, the answer is clearer. “No.” A little later, we turn to the matter of which box set Wiggins is currently hooked on. “I don’t switch the telly on much these days,” he replies. “I find it quite vacuous. I only watch things like First Dates – things that are real and about normal people interacting. Most people on TV are cunts …” There were various other gems – “apparently Ringo Starr is a shit drummer” – though we returned to a familiarly barren furrow on the question of painting. “I’m not really into art. It’s not my bag.” As for his fantasy dinner party, it’s a bijou affair. “Maybe I’d bring John Lennon and Bobby Moore,” decides Wiggins. “Just those two. I’d leave them to it, though. I wouldn’t want to bother them.” Very considerate, in the circumstances."
185,crime,"Children whitening skin to avoid racial hate crime, charity finds","Children are whitening their skin to try to avoid a rising tide of racial hate crimes, in which even babies under one year old have been targeted, a charity has said. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) said racial abuse and bullying of children had risen by one-fifth since 2015-16 to more than 10,000 incidents recorded by police last year. The charity said some callers to Childline, its telephone help service, had tried to change their appearance by using makeup to whiten their skin. Some children told counsellors they kept their pain a secret from their parents because they did not want to upset them. The NSPCC figures were compiled from freedom of information requests to police forces across the UK. The charity said children aged 12 to 15 were most likely to be affected. It found that in 2017-18 there were 10,571 offences recorded by police as race hate crimes against children under the age of 18, about 29 a day. The previous year the figure was 9,752 and in 2015-16 it was 8,683. One 10-year-old girl told the NSPCC: “I’ve been bullied ever since I started school. The bullies call me nasty names; it makes me feel so ashamed. My friends won’t hang out with me any more because people started asking why they were friends with someone who had dirty skin. “I was born in the UK but bullies tell me to go back to my own country. I don’t understand because I’m from the UK. I’ve tried to make my face whiter before using makeup so that I can fit in. I just want to enjoy going to school.” Tolga Yildiz, a senior Childline supervisor, said: “Children can experience this at school, out of school and online. They come up with different ways of coping. “We hear that they tell a teacher, it stops, and then it starts again and they are not confident to report it again.” The true figure is likely to be higher. Five police forces did not respond to the FoI request and police chiefs believe racial and faith hate crimes are underreported. According to the NSPCC, another girl, 11, said: “I’m being bullied at school because I’m Chinese. The other kids say that my skin is yellow, call me names, and it gets me really down. “I hate the way I look so much, I think if I looked different everyone would stop being mean to me and I’d fit in. I’ve tried to change the way that I look by using eyeliner so that I fit in more. I don’t want to tell my parents because I think it would upset them.” One 16-year-old girl from a Muslim background said: “People call me a terrorist and keep telling me to go back to where I came from. I dress in traditional Muslim clothes and I think it singles me out. I usually just put my head down and get on with it but it’s getting to the point now where I genuinely feel like I might get attacked.” It is the latest evidence to suggest a rise in racism in British society, which appears to have increased from about the time of the EU referendum in June 2016. Research revealed last week showed 71% of people from ethnic minorities reported facing racial discrimination, compared with 58% in January 2016. Atiyah Wazir, a Childline counsellor, said: “It is just as heartbreaking every single time a child tells you they wish they looked different. These children have been made to feel shame and guilt and sometimes daren’t tell their mums or dads about it because they don’t want to worry or hurt their feelings.” The Liverpool Echo on Wednesday reported that an 11-year-old boy, Ashley Davies, was called a “slave” and the N-word by children at a school in Cornwall after moving there from Merseyside. The child told the paper: “It makes me feel kind of sad because I am just trying to make friends. I’ve had loads of comments from people who don’t want me there. When I wake up in the morning, it’s like a burden.” His mother, Natalie, said: “The school have said they talk to the other children but it keeps happening again and again. “I am not saying all these kids are horrible racists but this is moulding my son now for how he is going to see the world. I think the school are trying but they don’t know what to do.” Assistant chief constable Mark Hamilton, the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for hate crime, said: “This criminality will not be tolerated. Police-recorded hate crime has increased in recent years. This is in part due to improvements in police recording, as well as spikes in hate crime following certain events such as the EU referendum and the terrorist attacks of 2017.”"
186,crime,Tackling knife crime and reshaping police forces,"Any strategy to address violent crime (Javid backs police as chiefs seek £15m fund to tackle knife crime, 7 March) will be undermined by resorting to kneejerk, counterproductive and discriminatory tactics. The 1999 Macpherson report found that institutional racism was apparent in the countrywide disparity in stop-and-search figures and reached a core conclusion of racist stereotyping. Stop and search is still concentrated on BAME communities. You are now eight times more likely to be stopped and searched by police if you are black than if you are white, and 14 times more likely in the case of suspicionless stops under section 60, even though black people are no more likely to be found with prohibited items than white people. At the same time, the government’s own serious violence strategy sets out that the reduction in stop and search over recent years is not the cause of rising violent crime. Calls to ratchet up stop and search and deploy suspicionless powers are not the serious, considered response that this pressing issue deserves. Nor are the government’s proposed knife crime prevention orders, which will fast-track young people into the criminal justice system. The police must be able to work effectively in the communities they serve. These punitive suggestions can only undermine that.Corey Stoughton Advocacy director, LibertyKatrina Ffrench Chief executive, StopWatch • The chancellor urges police forces to use existing money more efficiently (Hammond call to reassign officers angers police, 8 March). Yet successive governments and home secretaries have missed the obvious opportunity for savings. We have 43 separate forces, almost no central procurement, and massive duplication of strategic and tactical management and administration. Surely 43 could become, say, 10? National teams could focus on, for example, child abuse, modern slavery and the county lines problem. Doing the same thing over and over again with shrinking budgets is making us all unsafe in the streets and at home.Kim ThongerFinedon, Northamptonshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

187,crime,Penny Woolcock: ‘The rise in knife crime? It’s simple: massive inequality’,"Penny Woolcock was born in Buenos Aires in 1950 and moved to Europe as a teenager. Her career spans art, film, TV and opera. Her fiction films, such as Tina Goes Shopping and 1 Day, often feature non-professional actors. Her documentaries include One Mile Away, which saw her brokering a truce between rival Birmingham gangs. She has directed operas ranging from Bizet’s The Pearl Fishers to John Adams’s Dr Atomic at New York’s Met. Woolcock also directs the Yorkshire school drama Ackley Bridge, the third series of which is now on Channel 4. She lives in north London. What can we expect from this third season of Ackley Bridge?In a way, the underlying story is the same. It’s about life in a small provincial town, where the Muslim community, which is generally depicted on telly as terrorists and paedophiles, is funny, resourceful, living their lives like all the rest of us. The series is saying the opposite of what you hear all the time, that we live in this very divided and divisive world. We can all really live together. I’d never done anything prime time before. I tend to do things that go out at 11 o’clock at night! But the idea of making something that had a 50% Muslim cast, and was looking with humour and humanity at working-class communities in the north of England – I just leapt at it, actually. Do you think Ackley Bridge has a knack for anticipating and reflecting the big issues in education?It’s not preachy, but it does have stories about gender, sexuality, domestic violence. There’s the strand about the school being an academy, and the subjects that children actually enjoy – art, drama, music – being cut. That’s part of Michael Gove’s vision, basically, and it’s very, very hard on children who aren’t academically gifted. What do you make of British politics at the moment?I think these are very dark days, I really do. I was filming in Halifax for three or four months, and do you know how often I heard anybody discuss Brexit? Never. Not once. I think there are huge swathes of England that have totally given up – and actually, I have. I don’t want to listen to these dreadful people and their horrible ideas. You’ve used local pupils in Ackley Bridge, and working with non-professional actors has been a feature of your career...I’m not afraid of people – so perhaps that’s a key thing. I also don’t condescend. It also just makes it better: those kids are not acting, they’re just being. You take your cues from them – I always go up to kids and say “what music are you listening to now?” They find it very amusing that I like grime. What are you listening to at the moment?Recently I’ve been going on to [urban music website] GRM Daily and listening to Daily Duppy, it’s basically freestyling with a lot of young rappers – J Hus, Abra Cadabra. A lot of the wordsmithing is really sophisticated, really clever. But it’s also distressing because the stories are of people thinking violence and criminality is the only option they have. Musical developments such as drill music have been blamed for a recent wave of knife crime. How fair do you think that is?I think the music is telling us something that we should listen to – I don’t think it’s making those things happen at all. It annoys me when someone like Jay-Z or 50 Cent talk about how they’re shotting [dealing] drugs on the street corner when they’re multimillionaires. But when some kid is telling that story... it’s an indictment of how we’re marginalising young people. Do you have a sense of why we’re seeing a rise in knife crime?It’s really simple: it’s massive inequality. For a start, why don’t you invest in mental health services – a lot of the parents of these children are not well – and in youth clubs and services, which have been cut? It’s really not rocket science You’re also an opera director…People are sometimes surprised I like grime and opera. But they’re telling you a story in the same way, and I like stories. And they’re both very extreme: they can be very off-putting, so you have to surrender and be very open. I’ve just come back from LA. I’m developing an opera for 2020 with Wayne Shorter, the legendary jazz saxophone player; Frank Gehry the architect is designing the set and Esperanza Spalding is writing the libretto. It’s the same mixture of chaos and creativity that you get anywhere. I don’t like being in my comfort zone very much. I’m also working on a feature film about a drug dealer, and a series about women’s football. Is there any art form you haven’t tried yet that you have in your sights? A grime album maybe?I can definitely say I would never become a grime artist! I’d be rubbish at it. That, and ice skating. Ackley Bridge is on Channel 4 on Tuesdays, 8pm; the first two series are available on All 4"
188,crime,'It sticks to me like a disease': Fiji grapples with revenge porn as internet use booms,"Crystal* remembers the day her life came crashing down.  Crystal, 23, a former student at the University of the South Pacific in Suva, Fiji, had allowed her partner to take intimate pictures of her in 2014. It was a decision she would come to regret. Two years later, those pictures were published online in a public Dropbox folder, appearing alongside roughly 900 other images of young Fijian women. “It happened many years ago, but it still sticks to me like a disease,” she says.   Related: Children in Pacific suffer 'shockingly high' levels of violence, report finds    Revenge porn, of which Crystal was a victim, is devastating wherever it is experienced. But in Fiji, a Pacific nation with a population of just under one million, closely-knit communities and conservative attitudes to sex and gender, the social stigma around being a victim of such a crime is particularly pronounced. Crystal’s parents blamed her for what happened, and she was forced to drop out of university after they refused to fund her education. “My family says it is useless for me to study after what happened. They are trying to get me married off, but I want to complete my studies and become independent,” she says. “I was diagnosed with depression last year because I couldn’t take the pressure anymore and became suicidal.” Crystal believes her family’s “backward” attitude stemmed from a culture in Fiji that views sex as taboo, and a society that tends to empathise with male perpetrators. The case prompted a major police investigation and calls from women’s groups for tougher action on perpetrators. Revenge porn is one of the issues that the country is grappling with since the explosion of internet access in the country over the last decade. More than half of Fiji’s population now have access to the internet and usage is set to increase with government plans to provide high-speed broadband services to 95% of Fijian households by 2023. The country also has one of the highest rates of gender-based violence in the world, with two out of three women in Fiji subjected to some form of physical or sexual violence in their lifetime, double the global average. The Fiji Women’s Crisis Centre received 833 violence against women cases in 2019, with domestic violence the most common offence. “We have been concerned about this issue for a very long time,” said Shamima Ali, the coordinator of the Fiji Women’s Crisis Centre. Ali says Fiji’s police force are ill-equipped to investigate revenge porn, and that when it came to cybercrime, largely focused on financial crimes such as money-laundering and fraud. “I believe there isn’t information out there about this issue. A lot of women don’t want to come out because they feel that the whole family will be dishonoured, and she will be stigmatised.”     Shamima Ali, coordinator of the Fiji Women’s Crisis Centre. Photograph: Sheldon Chanel/The Guardian    According to Roshika Deo, a Fijian feminist activist, women who were the victims of revenge porn were stigmatised because of negative attitudes towards women who engaged in sexual activity. “They feel powerless and humiliated. They stop going to school or work. They become socially ostracised and face violence by members of their family and community. Anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts also develop,” she said. Opposition MP, Lynda Tabuya, has called for pornography to be banned in the country, saying it was fuelling negative attitudes towards women and contributing to an increase in sexual crimes; a call that was rejected by Mereseini Vuniwaqa, the minister for women, who said pornography bans were “virtually impossible” to implement.   Related: Horrific viral video reveals 'crisis' of school bullying in Fiji    But concern is growing among women’s rights groups who believe that while porn was not the root cause of gender violence, it was a contributing factor in a country with some of the highest rates of violence against women in the world. Nalini Singh, executive director of the Fiji Women’s Rights Movement, says that with the use of digital media expanding, there was an urgent need to improve sexual education in schools. Singh says that children need to be educated about their “bodies, consent, and healthy relationships” from an early age to prevent discrimination and sexual violence. “Banning porn will not change anything if attitudes towards women and girls don’t change and they are still seen as less,” she said. *not her real name."
189,crime,UK police record 51% rise in modern slavery offences in a year,"The number of modern slavery offences recorded by police has increased by more than 50% in a year, figures reveal, as the UK government published a plan to tackle the crime in its own supply chains. Police recorded 5,144 modern slavery offences in the year ending March 2019, data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows, a 51% rise over the previous 12 months, when 3,412 were recorded. There were 6,985 potential victims of modern slavery referred through the UK’s national referral mechanism (NRM) in the year ending December 2018, a rise of 36% in a year, the figures show.   Related: Beaten, raped and forced to work: why I'm exposing the scandal of Nigeria’s house girls    This coincided with a 68% increase in calls and submissions to the modern slavery helpline over the same time period. Modern slavery can take many forms including people trafficking, forced labour, servitude and sexual exploitation. The ONS said the number of victims and offences was likely to be higher. Many victims … do not self-identify, which means that quantifying the number of victims is challenging,” it said. There may be as many as 136,000 modern slavery victims in the UK, according to earlier estimates. The ONS analysed figures from the police, the Crown Prosecution Service, the modern slavery helpline, the NRM, the Salvation Army and others. Helen Ross, of the ONS’s crime and justice centre, said: “This is the ONS’s first attempt to bring data sources together on modern slavery to help us better understand both the nature of this terrible crime and the potential demand on support services. “While there is no one source or method available which accurately quantifies the number of victims in the UK, evidence suggests there have been improvements in identification since the introduction of the Modern Slavery Act in 2015. Yet this is only part of the story, as many cases remain hidden and unreported.” Almost a quarter – 23% – of the potential victims referred through the NRM in the year ending December 2018 were UK nationals. The figures came as the government claimed to have become the first in the world to publish a modern slavery statement, which sets out how it is tackling modern slavery in its supply chains. The statement outlines actions taken to ensure taxpayers’ money does not fund criminal exploitation. Ministerial departments will publish individual statements from 2020-21.

Thousands of businesses are required to publish annual modern slavery statements under the Modern Slavery Act 2015. Theodore Agnew, a Cabinet Office minister, said: “As a government, we are committed to driving out modern slavery in all forms, so it is crucial that we make sure it’s nowhere to be seen in the supply chains which help provide our vital public services.”"
190,crime,Monsey attack: man charged with hate crimes over stabbings at rabbi's home,"The man accused of stabbing five members of an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in New York has been charged with federal hate crimes.   Related: White House expecting agreement with China 'within next week or so'    In a criminal complaint filed by the US attorney’s office for the southern district of New York on Monday, Grafton Thomas, 37, is accused of harboring extremist motivations. The complaint alleges Grafton kept diaries that contained antisemitic views, references to Adolf Hitler and “Nazi culture,” and drawings of a Star of David and a swastika. The documents also refer to a phone found in Grafton’s car that allegedly contained online searched-for phrases like “Why did Hitler hate the Jews”, “German Jewish Temples near me” as well as a recent news article about New York’s plan to increases police presence in vulnerable neighborhoods. Thomas pleaded not guilty to five counts of attempted murder and one count of first-degree burglary. In a statement released Sunday, his lawyer, Michael Sussman, said his client “had a long history of mental illness and hospitalizations” but “no known history of antisemitism”. The federal hate charges come as Democratic presidential candidates condemned the spate of antisemitic attacks and incidents over the holiday period. Bernie Sanders told a crowd at a menorah-lighting ceremony: “If there was ever a time when we say no to divisiveness, this is that moment.” Sanders, who is Jewish and who had relatives who died in the Holocaust, made his comments after an intruder stabbed five people at a rabbi’s home in Monsey, Rockland county, about 30 miles north of New York City, on Saturday night. The attack was called an act of “domestic terrorism” by New York governor Andrew Cuomo. “We’re seeing people being stabbed yesterday in New York City because they were Jewish,” Sanders told a congregation at an event in Des Moines, Iowa, to light a public menorah on the final night of Hanukah. Sanders described the latest attack, one of seven in as many days in the New York area, as part of an alarming rise in antisemitism in the United States and globally. “If there was ever a time in American history where we say no to religious bigotry, this is the time. If there was ever a time when we say no to divisiveness, this is that moment,” he added, warning of a rise in tolerance against people targeted for their race, religion or identity.

Photograph: Peter Foley/EPA    His remarks came hours after a separate incident in which a gunman opened fire on a church in White Settlement, Texas, killing two parishioners. As political leaders grappled with the aftermath of the Monsey attack, Thomas is reportedly being investigated in connection with an earlier stabbing of a Jewish man near a synagogue in the same area. Grafton was reportedly covered in blood when he was arrested in Harlem following the attack, and is undergoing psychiatric evaluation. Antisemitic crimes rose 22% in 2018 compared with 2017, according to NYPD figures, and have risen again in 2019. The Anti-Defamation League recorded 1,879 antisemitic incidents in 2018, including an attack on Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue that left 11 dead and six wounded. On Sunday, Donald Trump decried the attack in Monsey “as horrific”. “We must all come together to fight, confront, and eradicate the evil scourge of antisemitism,” Trump tweeted. Other candidates in the 2020 election race were united in their responses to the attack. “I’m heartsick for the victims of this horrific attack. This is unfortunately just the latest of a series of antisemitic attacks in New York and New Jersey,” Elizabeth Warren wrote on Twitter. “We must fight antisemitism and make clear that hateful bigotry has no place in our society.” Cory Booker, a senator for New Jersey, where six people were killed in a shooting that targeted a kosher supermarket earlier this month, said: “The increasing frequency of antisemitic attacks is horrifying. We must all join to stop them in their tracks and root out the hatred and ignorance at their core.” Former vice-president and 2020 contender Joe Biden offered his “deepest sympathies” to the victims and their families. “The horrifying rise of antisemitism is tearing apart the fabric of our communities and the soul of this nation,” Biden messaged. “We’ve got to stand together as a country and fight these flames of hatred.” South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg said his “prayers are with the victims of these horrific acts of antisemitism and hate. This cannot be tolerated.”"
191,crime,Navy Seal pardoned of war crimes by Trump described by colleagues as 'freaking evil',"A Navy Seal platoon leader controversially cleared of war crimes by Donald Trump was a “toxic” character who was “OK with killing anything that moved”, according to fellow Iraq veterans who reported his conduct to military investigators.   Related: 2019: the year US foreign policy fell apart    The explosive testimony was published Friday by the New York Times, which obtained previously unseen video interviews and text messages from several former members of an elite commando unit once led by special operations chief Eddie Gallagher. Gallagher was convicted in July of posing with the dead body of a teenage Islamic State captive he had just killed with a hunting knife. He was granted clemency by the president in November in a decision that angered military chiefs. In the interviews, conducted by navy investigators looking into Gallagher’s conduct during a tour of duty in Iraq in 2017, fellow platoon members told of a ruthless leader who stabbed the captive to death for no reason then forced his troops to pose for a photograph with the corpse. At his court martial, Gallagher was acquitted of murder but demoted in rank for the lesser charge of posing with the body – a decision Trump reversed. In a lengthy criminal investigation report, the navy detectives laid out other allegations against Gallagher, including shooting a schoolgirl and elderly man from a sniper’s roost. Members of Alpha Platoon’s Seal Team 7 alarmed by their leader’s conduct said they were initially shut down by military chiefs when they first spoke up, and told their own careers would suffer if they continued to talk about it. Eventually, the Navy Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) began an inquiry and the platoon members were called to give evidence. “The guy is freaking evil,” special operator first class Craig Miller, one of the platoon’s most experienced members, told investigators in sometimes tearful testimony. “I think Eddie was proud of it, and that was, like, part of it for him.” Miller said Gallagher, who had the nickname Blade, went on to stage a bizarre “re-enlistment ceremony” over the body of the captive. “I was listening to it and I was just thinking, like, this is the most disgraceful thing I have ever seen in my life,” he said. At his court martial, the panel heard evidence that Gallagher had emailed a photograph to a friend in the US containing a photograph of him holding up the dead captive’s head with the words: “Good story behind this, got him with my hunting knife.” Another platoon member, medic Corey Scott, said: “You could tell he was perfectly OK with killing anybody that was moving.” In text messages exchanged by the group around the time of their testimony, which were also obtained by the New York Times, platoon members urged each other to speak truthfully to the investigators. “Tell the truth, don’t lie or embellish,” one team member, a sniper, wrote. “That way he can’t say that we slandered him in any way.” Gallagher maintains the allegations against him are a fabrication by platoon members who could not match his own high standards and who were intent on ousting him.   Related: Hawaii: tour helicopter carrying seven people missing    “My first reaction to seeing the videos was surprise and disgust that they would make up blatant lies about me, but I quickly realized that they were scared that the truth would come out of how cowardly they acted on deployment,” Gallagher said in a statement to the Times issued by his lawyer Timothy Parlatore. “I felt sorry for them that they thought it necessary to smear my name.” Despite Gallagher’s conviction for war crimes, Trump has lauded him – and two other military members he granted clemency to last month – as “great fighters”. “I stood up for three great warriors against the deep state,” Trump told supporters at a Thanksgiving rally in Sunrise, Florida, apparently referring to a decision just weeks earlier by Adm Mike Gilday, the US navy’s chief of operations, to deny Gallgher’s appeal for clemency and uphold his demotion. Gallagher and his wife Andrea were photographed last weekend with the president and first lady Melania Trump at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private Florida resort where he is spending the holidays."
192,crime,"Facial recognition tech prevents crime, police tell UK privacy case","Facial recognition cameras prevent crime, protect the public and do not breach the privacy of innocent people whose images are captured, a police force has argued. Ed Bridges, an office worker from Cardiff, claims South Wales police violated his privacy and data protection rights by using facial recognition technology on him. But Jeremy Johnson QC compared automated facial recognition (AFR) to the use of DNA to solve crimes and said it would have had little impact on Bridges.   Related: Facial recognition tech is creeping into our lives – I’m going to court to stop it | Ed Bridges    Johnson, representing the police, said: “AFR is a further technology that potentially has great utility for the prevention of crime, the apprehension of offenders and the protection of the public.” The technology maps faces in a crowd and then compares them with a watch list of images, which can include suspects, missing people and persons of interest to the police. The cameras scan faces in large crowds in public places such as streets, shopping centres, football crowds and music events such as the Notting Hill carnival. Johnson said the process also included human interaction. He said: “It is up to the operator to decide whether the person is a match or not. You then have the intervention. “It’s not that the operator makes their own assessment, the officer on the ground looking at the individual will make their own assessment and will decide whether or not to intervene and speak to the individual.” The hearing at Cardiff civil and family justice centre was told by Johnson that under common law police had the power to use visual imagery for the “prevention and detection of crime”. It has been argued that the use of AFR is unregulated, but Johnson said police must adhere to data protection rules and have a code of practice for the management of information. The court heard South Wales police did not believe article 8 of the Human Rights Act – which enshrines rights around private life – and the Data Protection Act had been breached by the use of CCTV or AFR cameras. Johnson argued a police officer monitoring CCTV manually had the same “practical impact” on an individual as an AFR camera. He said: “So far as the individual is concerned, we submit there is no difference in principle to knowing you are on CCTV and somebody looking at it.” Johnson added that those not on a watch list would not have their data stored after being scanned by AFR cameras. The court heard a trial period for the use of AFR started in south Wales in May 2017 and is still under way. Bridges believes his face was scanned while he was shopping in 2017 and at a peaceful anti-arms protest in 2018, and that this had caused him distress. He has used crowdfunding to pay for the legal action with the support of the human rights organisation Liberty. It argues AFR has profound consequences for privacy and data protection rights. But Johnson said: “It’s difficult to say that an automated immediate computerised comparison is more intrusive than police officers sitting down looking at albums of photographs.” The court heard Bridges was not on a watch list. Johnson said: “He was not spoken to by a police officer, far less arrested. We say the practical impact on him was very limited.” Johnson said AFR was used at the anti-arms trade protest in Cardiff in 2018, which was attended by Bridges. A woman had made a bomb threat at the same event last year and was therefore on a watch list, he added. The barrister said: “It’s of obvious value for these police officers to know that person is there so that if another bomb threat is made they can deal with it accordingly. We say a fair balance has been struck.” The case continues."
193,crime,"Prison increases youth knife-crime reoffending, says police report","Prison does not work for young knife-crime offenders, and while stop and search has a short-term benefit, it risks alienating key sections of society, a police study has found. The study by the College of Policing, the government-backed body aiming to improve law enforcement, has been sent to all forces in England and Wales as they grapple with rising knife crime. It reviewed research on causes and effective strategies. It found that the peak age for carrying a knife was 15, and said focused “tough” action by police, such as intelligence-led stop and search, can suppress rises in stabbings only in the short term. The report found that a “public health” approach tackling the root causes was the only long-term hope, involving many other agencies as well as the police. In an apparent rejection of knee-jerk calls for action, it said gangs were responsible for as little as 5% of stabbings and that tougher sentences and prison did not appear to tackle reoffending. The report said: “For juveniles (10–18 years), prison alone has been found to significantly increase reoffending, compared to non-custodial sanctions such as community supervision with victim reparation, and community surveillance and aftercare.” It also said first-time offenders made up the majority – 72% – of those found guilty of knife and offensive weapons offences in the year ending March 2018. Figures released on Thursday showed that there were 40,829 knife offences across England and Wales last year, up nearly 17,000 since 2013/14. The study pointed out that young males were the most likely to use knives and that nationwide, “there is no statistically significant relationship between ethnicity and weapon carrying”. But, separately from the study, racial differences have been found across the English regions, with victims and perpetrators in London being more likely to be from African-Caribbean communities. Police in north-west England say they have noted no racial differences. In London, where one-third of all knife offences took place, African-Caribbeans were more likely to be subjected to stop and search than their white counterparts, to such an extent that more black people were stopped last year than white, despite being a fraction of the population size. Police have said they carry out stop and searches with respect, but the study warned that the searches can leave people feeling as if they cannot rely on the police to protect them: “While intelligence helps the targeting of stop and search, people’s willingness to provide information is likely to be affected by how fair they perceive the police to be in their use of this power. “Young people, the economically disadvantaged, and people from some minority ethnic groups are significantly more likely to be stopped, and to be dissatisfied with police treatment during a stop. “If contact with officers is felt to be unfair, analysis also suggests it can undermine young people’s perception that the police are ‘on their side’, reducing their willingness to comply with the law, and is associated with increased risk that they consider violence to be an option in achieving certain goals.” Dave Tucker, head of crime for the College of Policing, said: “If you feel you are already at risk and then the police stop and search you and treat you badly, you then feel over-policed and under-protected. You might then decide you will protect yourself because the organs of the state are not doing so.”  The police study said the reasons youngsters carried knives were to protect themselves, especially if they have suffered crime, for “street credibility” and “respect”, and also to carry out crimes such as “theft, sexual assault, injury and serious harm”. Key risk factors included adverse childhood experiences, such as abuse, neglect, criminality or drug and alcohol abuse by parents, and being in care. Other risk factors include poor school performance and exclusions. The study said intervention with children typically starts around age 13, and that may be too late. Encouraging results have been achieved by teaching children “social and emotional skills, problem solving and anger management”, better support for parents and after-school activities. The study concluded: “Public health approaches, involving multiple agencies to develop a range of interventions, including prevention work for at-risk groups, as well as law enforcement activity directed at offenders, have been shown to have a positive impact.” "
194,crime,Derek Mackay: police speak to boy sent messages by MSP,"Police have spoken to the 16-year-old boy who was bombarded with social media messages from Scotland’s former finance secretary Derek Mackay. Police Scotland said that while it had not “received any complaint of criminality” regarding the Scottish National party politician’s behaviour, it was “assessing available information”. It has emerged that Mackay – who resigned from his government role after the scandal broke and just hours before he was due to present the budget – has deleted, or restricted access to, his social media accounts. He resigned after the Scottish Sun reported he had sent 270 messages to a schoolboy he befriended on Facebook and Instagram. The teenager told the paper: “I was happy to speak to the police and will tell them everything that happened. I didn’t think what he was doing was a crime but I knew it was wrong and should be highlighted.” A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: “We would encourage anyone with information to please come forward. Police Scotland will always listen to anyone who wishes to seek advice or formally report a matter to us.” Mackay, who has been suspended from the SNP pending an investigation, is reported to have called the boy “cute” as well as offering to take him to a rugby game and out to dinner.   Related: Derek Mackay's resignation may derail SNP's policy agenda    Opposition politicians have condemned what they described as predatory behaviour, saying the messages amounted to grooming by Mackay, who had been tipped as a future successor to the SNP leader and first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. Mackay has not been seen in public since the story broke on Wednesday night. The father-of-two disclosed he was gay after his marriage ended in 2013. After the Scottish Sun report, it emerged that the Renfrewshire North and West MSP had also sent dozens of unwanted messages to an SNP activist over a period of four years. Shaun Cameron, 25, told the Daily Record on Friday that Mackay contacted him on Facebook after meeting him at an SNP event when he was 21. He said some of the messages were “quite suggestive” and alleged the then finance secretary had asked him in September 2017: “Got any naughty pics?” Sturgeon confirmed to MSPs at Holyrood on Thursday that she had accepted Mackay’s resignation from government, and that his behaviour had fallen “seriously below the standard required of a minister”. In his resignation statement, Mackay said he took full responsibility for his actions and apologised unreservedly to the boy and his family. “I have behaved foolishly and I am truly sorry.” He remains an MSP but is facing mounting calls to quit."
195,crime,"I am the 'book murderer', but I tear them apart out of love","We should never bisect the things we love. Friends, nations, puppies. I would argue an exception for pizza. But over the last 24 hours I have found that almost everyone on the internet agrees we should not chop books in half, even if they are very long. It started when my colleague saw half a paperback on my desk and called me a “book murderer”. I had been enjoying it so much at home that I found the end of a 16-page section, chopped off the remaining pages, bound the unread half in some cardboard to prevent the pages getting too dog-eared, and brought them to work in my pocket. I thought my colleague was overreacting, but when I posted a picture of my latest victims on Twitter, it started trending next to Jess Phillips – who had real news to share. People were replying in other languages, copying in the International Criminal Court, the FBI and the Metropolitan police. Others suggested chopping me in half. The thing is, I used to think I didn’t like long books. But then I realised that I just didn’t like carrying them around or holding them open with one tired thumb, squashed into someone’s armpit on the tube in rush hour. I did have a Kindle, and I sometimes listened to audiobooks, but whenever I had a big paperback I would leave it at home unread, or struggle through eight pages a night before falling asleep. So a few years ago, I started seeking out beautiful old two-volume editions of books such as The Brothers Karamazov and War and Peace, which fit neatly in my pocket. I found that I actually read the books that way. I started chopping big paperbacks by modern authors in half and shoddily patching them up. I assumed the authors wouldn’t mind selling a new paperback to someone else, and I really only wanted to get the words into my skull. Although the majority of the responses were urging me to get in the bin or the sea, I was strangely heartened that people care so much. How amazing that we still value books when so much else is digital or disposable. People never really throw books away. Instead they hand them around, leave them in book exchanges, trade them secondhand, give them to charity, or lend them to friends and relatives. They are the lifeblood of society.   Related: The history of the book, from Gilgamesh to now – books podcast    It’s tragic when books are used as trays for a restaurant bill, or bought in bulk to give a pop of colour to someone’s interior design. But the real tragedy is that those books aren’t being read. The codex is just a mortal husk – the soul of a book is the story, and the form of words used to tell it. Authors don’t generally dream of seeing their books cellophaned in mint condition, like Star Wars memorabilia. The biggest compliment you can pay an author is to read their book, let them tell you their story – take it to heart and tell others. So I don’t like to think of myself as a book murderer. More like a gung-ho reader. And if you find one of my (short) books in your possession, you have my permission to chop it in half."
196,crime,Police investigate pro-Brexit hate crimes in Lewes,"Police in Lewes in East Sussex are investigating a spate of suspected hate crimes committed overnight on Thursday, including the bricking of an anti-Brexit campaigner’s window, antisemitic graffiti on a garden fence and Nazi symbols daubed on a house. Eugene Gill woke up to find a half brick had been thrown through his kitchen window where he was displaying a “Stop Brexit” poster, residents in The Avenue found “Fuck the Jews Soros’s Whores Traitor’s [sic]” sprayed in 2ft-high red letters along a fence, and a wall on Paddock Close was sprayed with the slogan: “Save Old Sussex Kill a DFL SOS” with the S’s written in the style of the Nazi SS logo. DFL is a derogatory term for someone who has moved down from London to the South Downs market town.

Boris Johnson’s recent language has served to reduce trust in our democracy and intensify divisions, creating an uncivil atmosphere which emboldens extremist views.” Hours before the attacks, Caulfield said her car tyres had been damaged with nails and screws.

197,crime,The World Is Yours review – brash Franco-crime caper,"Romain Gavras is no political firebrand like his father, Costa-Gavras. But there is something faintly political in his decision to make what former French president Nicolas Sarkozy called la racaille (“scum”)– the outsiders, chancers and artful dodgers from the country’s immigrant underclass – so unrepentantly the heroes of his second film, a brash and jubilant Guy Ritchie-style crime caper. Karim Leklou stars as Farès, a schlubby small-time dealer looking to go straight by acquiring the Mr Freeze ice-pops franchise in Morocco. When he finds out that his mother (a brazen Isabelle Adjani) has gambled away the savings needed to close the deal, he’s forced to lead a Benidorm drugs run for Putin, the new drug lord on the block. Long part of the Parisian hipster set, with music videos for Justice and MIA under his belt, Gavras packs The World Is Yours with high social-satire tonnage: from Adjani’s monstrous bling-hunting Maghreb mum, to Mohamed and Mohamed, the two tracksuited lackeys who enjoy running down English-speaking tourists to beat up live on Periscope. What saves the director from hipster archness is his feel for the argot and eye for detail, often visually delivered with the succinct kick of a great sample. That affection even bends to something almost melancholic, as in the closeup on the dandruff Vincent Cassel’s gone-to-seed ex-con flicks off his shoulder at one point. Gavras often takes such private moments and lets them run free into music-vid transcendence. Left to her own devices in her flat, Adjani gives us a boogie and a few wistful bars of French soft rock. Everyone on this Costa del Eurotrash is looking for an angle. Farès believes his girlfriend has got his back, but she looks ready to jump ship once it looks as if Sam Spruell’s leering Scottish supplier has got his number. “Europe isn’t Club Med,” Farès’s fixer warns the Eritrean pool boys he’s keeping on a dollar a day. In The World Is Yours, it’s actually a globalised free-for-all where someone more venal is just around the corner. Gavras has seized his chance, staging this uptempo, carnivalesque crime pic with panache and wit.           "
198,crime,Surge in stop and search in England as police battle knife crime,"Police attempts to tackle violent crime have brought about a sharp rise in the use of stop and search powers in some of England’s major forces, Guardian analysis reveals. In findings that critics have described as deeply worrying, data from eight of the country’s biggest forces shows the scale of the use of stop and search, which more than doubled from 15,557 instances in March 2017 to 33,022 in March 2019. In 2018, eight major forces recorded 214,240 stop and searches, a rise from 178,318 in 2017. The Metropolitan police, Greater Manchester and the West Midlands police were behind the surge. Critics say stop-and-search powers disproportionately target black people and undermine community relations.   Related: Boris Johnson pledges to increase stop and search powers    The home secretary, Sajid Javid, enhanced section 60 powers in March this year, giving police officers more scope to stop and search people without reasonable suspicion in an attempt to combat knife crime. The frontrunner for the Conservative leadership, Boris Johnson, has repeatedly pledged to boost police powers to execute stop and searches in an effort to beat knife crime. He told a hustings event last month: “It’s about giving police the political cover and support they need to do stop and search and to come down hard on those carrying knives,” he said.   graphic   David Lammy, the Labour MP for for Tottenham, said: “The deeply worrying rise in stop and search, resulting from deliberate strategic choice by the home secretary, shows a police force on the back foot as a result of vast funding shortfalls resulting from austerity. As Sajid Javid has tacitly admitted during the Tory leadership campaign, the police have been starved of resources since 2010.” Lammy said rather than addressing the root causes of violent crime, such as deprivation, the government had chosen “to pursue a policy that it knows is inherently unfair, unjust and ineffectual”.   Related: If the police step up stop-and-search tactics, trouble will follow | John Drury    The MP said rising use of stop and search would further increase tensions in our society and “exacerbate the crisis at a time of unprecedented division”. Omar Khan, the director of the Runnymede Trust, said the re-emergence of these powers was worrying. “We are in a world where most black men will have a family member who has been stopped and searched. I think it will create more tensions in communities – that has always been the case.” Khan said it was particularly worrying that the police did not seem to be listening to those affected by the policy, “discounting them as troublemakers and dismissing the fact that it [stop and search] was racially discriminatory”. Rosalind Comyn, policy and campaigns officer at Liberty, said the rise reflected “a troubling reliance on these powers as a cure-all for serious youth violence, while neglecting the risks they pose”.  Adrian Hanstock, the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for stop and search, said it was ultimately “an evidence gathering and safeguarding power”.  He said: “In recent months, those forces referenced have increased their use of their section 60 powers, which are intended to prevent violent crime and remove drugs and weapons from our streets, in response to the actual levels of violence being experienced. This is undoubtedly supported by public mandate in the main.” Hanstock said they were evaluating the impact of an increased use of section 60 search powers. The enhanced powers, which the Home Office announced on 31 March, reduced the authorisation required for a section 60 from senior officer to inspector. A lesser degree of certainty was required by the police. The Guardian sent a freedom of information request to eight of the biggest police forces in England: Greater Manchester, the Metropolitan police, Merseyside, Northumbria, Devon and Cornwall, Thames Valley, West Midlands and West Yorkshire. Greater Manchester police have reported a rise in the use of stop and search from 2,852 cases in 2017 to 4,831 in 2019. The Met had a rise from 136,647 to 180,991 over the same period. John Sutherland, a retired borough commander who worked for the Met for more than 25 years, said the debate around stop and search was often reduced to the binary, with people thinking it was either the solution to everything or the route of all evil. “It has become increasingly difficult to have nuanced, intelligent conversation between those positions, and neither is correct … It has to be more than a binary debate,” he said. He added: “The rise in use in itself is not bad, but it must be used appropriately. We must get beyond the binary … We don’t have enough police officers out there and have not used stop and search adequately or sufficiently. And that has been significantly because of the politicisation of the power. “From both sides of the political spectrum, senior politicians are guilty of politicising an operational power and with significantly damaging consequences.” A Home Office spokesperson said stop and search was an important tool in disrupting crime. “However, nobody should be stopped based on their race or ethnicity, and forces must ensure that officers use these intrusive powers in a way that is fair, lawful and effective.”"
199,crime,Navy Seal accused of war crimes meets Trump and thanks him for pardon,"A former Navy Seal controversially granted clemency for war crimes by Donald Trump last month was photographed with the president in Florida at the weekend, and handed over a gift to thank him for reversing his demotion. Chief petty officer Eddie Gallagher, who was convicted of posing with the dead body of a teenage Islamic State terrorist he had just killed in Iraq in 2017, posted photographs to his Instagram account showing himself and his wife Andrea meeting the president and first lady, Melania Trump, at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. “Finally got to thank the President and his amazing wife by giving them a little gift from Eddie’s deployment to Mosul,” a caption accompanying the eight photographs said, without identifying what the present was.            View this post on Instagram           Finally got to thank the President and his amazing wife by giving them a little gift from Eddie’s deployment to Mosul. 🇺🇸 #TRUMP2020 @realdonaldtrump @flotus A post shared by  Eddie &amp; Andrea (@eddie_and_andrea) on Dec 21, 2019 at 8:45pm PST    Trump angered military leaders in November when he granted clemency to Gallagher as one of a number of interventions in cases of service members accused of killings in Afghanistan and Iraq. In Gallagher’s case, Trump ordered a promotion for the special warfare operator first class who had been cleared by a military jury in 2018 of murder but convicted of posing with the body. “Good story behind this, got him with my hunting knife,” Gallagher had boasted in an email to a friend that contained a photograph of him holding the deceased captive by the head. Just weeks before Trump interceded, Adm Mike Gilday, the US navy’s chief of operations, denied Gallagher’s request for clemency and upheld a sentence of a reduction in rank. “The Navy will NOT be taking away War Fighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher’s Trident pin,” Trump tweeted on 21 November. “The case was handled very badly from the beginning.” Gallagher was allowed to retire from the service as a Seal, retaining an additional $200,000 pension he would have forfeited had his demotion stood. Navy secretary Richard Spencer was ousted by the White House in the aftermath of the controversy, and wrote a scathing opinion piece for the Washington Post attacking Trump for his “shocking and unprecedented” intervention in Gallagher’s case, and claiming the president “has very little understanding” of how the military works. Gallagher’s appearance at Mar-a-Lago came as little surprise to some observers, among them the legal analyst Glenn Kirschner, who accused Trump in a tweet of ushering in “the death of decency”. Earlier, Gallagher was pictured with the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr, at a conservative student action summit hosted by the campus activist group Turning Point USA in West Palm Beach, according to the New York Post."
